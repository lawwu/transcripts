[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.300]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.920]   Today, we're going to discuss your brain chemistry
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.800]   and how to control and optimize your brain chemistry
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.840]   for all aspects of mental health,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.120]   physical health, and performance.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.560]   Many times before on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   and frankly, every time I'm a guest on another podcast,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680]   I get questions about science and science-based tools
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.740]   for things like enhancing sleep, enhancing focus,
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.040]   enhancing creativity, improving relationships,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.500]   getting over grief, and on and on,
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.220]   all of which are valid questions
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.000]   and for which there are protocols that are based in science
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.320]   and that work the first time and every time.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.300]   However, far more important than knowing a protocol
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.000]   is understanding why a given protocol works.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.960]   That's why I'm always hammering on mechanism
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.480]   and explaining the cells and circuits and chemicals,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.060]   at least to some detail,
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.080]   so that people can understand not just what to do,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   but why it works and therefore how to change a protocol
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.280]   as their life circumstances change or as goals change.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.160]   Now, today we are going to go even a layer deeper.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.120]   We're going to explore the foundations of your biology
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   in your brain and body that allow any protocol to work
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.460]   because as it turns out, all of the protocols out there,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.100]   whether or not it's a breathing protocol or a supplement
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.580]   or a prescription drug or an exercise routine,
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.740]   they all tap into and leverage a core set
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.300]   of just a few biological mechanisms.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.140]   That's right.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.420]   Beneath everything you are able to do and feel,
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.580]   and indeed beneath every protocol
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.660]   that allows you to change for the better
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.100]   and optimize your mental health,
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.860]   physical health, and performance,
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.900]   there's just a small subset of chemicals
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.620]   that you're leveraging toward that change.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.420]   So today we're going to talk about the four major pillars
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.740]   of neurochemistry that allow you to, for instance,
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.660]   be focused when you want to focus,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.820]   that allow you to relax when you need to relax
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.940]   and de-stress, that allow you to optimize your sleep,
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.980]   that allow you to optimize your exercise routine
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.700]   or to work through a pain point in relationship
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.900]   or in career or in your relationship to yourself.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.940]   So what I can say for sure is that by the end
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.820]   of this episode, you will have a much richer understanding
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.140]   about how your brain and nervous system
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.220]   and indeed your entire body work,
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.660]   and you will have a much firmer understanding
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.740]   as to which protocols and tools to reach for
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.700]   given your particular goals in the moment,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.700]   in the day, across the week, across the month,
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.720]   across the year, and indeed across your entire lifespan.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.400]   So what we're really going for today are principles,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.300]   deeper understanding of why any given protocol works,
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.460]   and we are also going to discuss specific protocols.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.340]   Some of those protocols I've discussed
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.080]   on previous episodes of the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.660]   but I must say many of the protocols and tools
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.480]   that I will discuss are brand new and based on research
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.140]   that I have not discussed at all,
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.480]   simply because the research papers came out only recently,
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.780]   or these are papers that I only recently unearthed.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.300]   In fact, I'm going to share with you two recent studies
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.140]   in a moment that are exceedingly important
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.080]   for optimizing your sleep, and these are studies that,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.440]   again, I've never discussed in any episode on sleep
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.820]   or on any other podcast.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.260]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.620]   you're going to have far more knowledge
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.260]   about your biology and psychology
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.540]   than you did at the start,
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.420]   and you'll be armed with many more tools
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.680]   and most importantly, principles so that you can navigate
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.120]   not just the tools presented on this podcast,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.760]   but in the vast landscape of tools that are out there
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.420]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.380]   The "Huberman Lab Podcast" is proud to announce
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.640]   that we've partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.920]   We've done that for several reasons.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.960]   First of all, the quality of their supplements
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.500]   is exceedingly high.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.600]   Second of all, we wanted to have a location
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.200]   where you could find all of the supplements
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.880]   discussed on the "Huberman Lab Podcast"
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.860]   in one easy to find place.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.200]   You can now find that place at livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.540]   In addition, Momentus Supplements ship internationally,
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.420]   something that a lot of other supplement companies
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.660]   simply do not do.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.560]   So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.620]   or you live abroad.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.200]   Right now, not all of the supplements that we discuss
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.260]   on the "Huberman Lab Podcast" are listed,
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.920]   but that catalog of supplements
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.620]   is being expanded very rapidly,
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.400]   and a good number of them that we've talked about,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.780]   some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.040]   and other aspects of mental and physical health
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.880]   are already there.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.720]   Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.480]   Every so often, I come across a study or set of studies
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.800]   that I get so excited about
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.380]   that I start telling everybody in my immediate life,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.320]   and I insist on also sharing it with you,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.620]   the listeners of this podcast,
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.520]   because I find the information
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.320]   to be so incredibly interesting and actionable.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.120]   The two studies that I'm going to discuss
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.620]   both relate to sleep and sleep states
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.640]   and how to access better sleep.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.560]   The first one was published in the journal Cell Reports,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.320]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.280]   and the title of this paper
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.360]   is "Rapid and Reversible Control of Human Metabolism
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.860]   by Individual Sleep States."
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.660]   We will provide a link to the study in the show captions.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.820]   The first author is Nora Nowak, N-O-W-A-K.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.840]   And basically what they did is they measured
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.060]   the different forms of metabolism that occur
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.660]   while humans sleep.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.860]   As far as I know, this is one of the first studies
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.300]   of this kind.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.080]   There are many studies of metabolism.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.620]   There are many studies of sleep.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.680]   This study focused on how different states of sleep,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.420]   such as rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.800]   which is associated with dreaming
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.220]   and high emotional content dreams versus slow wave sleep,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.340]   which tends to be more focused on physical repair
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.240]   of the body, more mundane dreams,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.860]   how those different states of mind during sleep
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.580]   relate to different aspects of metabolism.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.700]   And what they found was absolutely fascinating.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.020]   First of all, they found that sleep states regulate
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.260]   more than 50%, half of all the metabolite features
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.020]   detected in human breath.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.900]   What does that mean?
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.420]   Well, it turns out that you can figure out
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.780]   what humans are metabolizing in particular,
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.500]   more lipids or more carbohydrate,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.660]   whether or not they're relying more on glucose metabolism
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.420]   based on the contents of their breath.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.580]   This is true during waking and during sleep.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.740]   And this is what allowed them to do
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.780]   these incredible measurements
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.100]   of what's being metabolized during sleep.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.380]   They measured close to 2,000 metabolites in breath
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.340]   every 10 seconds across the entire night's sleep.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.740]   And what they found was that there are major pathways
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.620]   related to lipid metabolism, fat metabolism,
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.540]   or to carbohydrate metabolism,
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.340]   or other forms of metabolism that are up or down regulated
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.040]   as human beings transition between slow wave sleep,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.260]   rapid eye movement sleep, and waking.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.200]   And you might say waking.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.040]   Well, yes, they also looked as people fell asleep
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.140]   and as they emerged from sleep.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.240]   And believe it or not, every so often during sleep,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.860]   you wake up, you didn't know this,
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.840]   but you wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.020]   you look around and you go back to sleep.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.860]   You're not aware of it
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.460]   because you're still in a rather sleep-like state,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.020]   although you are awake.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.380]   What they found was that sleep
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.820]   and the various states of sleep
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   regulated individual metabolic pathways.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.320]   They found, for instance,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.020]   that the switch from sleep to wakefulness
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.180]   reduces fatty acid oxidation.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.460]   So that means while you're asleep,
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.640]   you're oxidating more fatty acids.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.020]   And as you wake up, that becomes less the case.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.940]   And there's a switch in slow wave sleep
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.100]   that increases fatty acid oxidation.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.040]   And there's this transition from rapid eye movement sleep
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.520]   to other aspects of sleep
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.460]   that brings about things like the so-called TCA cycle.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.960]   Some of you familiar with metabolism
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.560]   will be familiar with the TCA cycle,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.760]   the so-called tricarbolic acid cycle,
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.120]   intermediates, that's fancy nerd speak
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.020]   for specific aspects of metabolism being regulated
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.400]   during this rapid eye movement sleep transition.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.020]   What does all this mean and how is this actionable?
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.220]   Well, on many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.580]   such as the master sleep episode
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.920]   and the episode that we're going into in further depth today,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.680]   we're going to talk about sleep and how to optimize sleep.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.100]   It's been thought of, but not really tamped down,
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.320]   that quality and depth of sleep and duration of sleep
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.820]   is important for metabolism during the daytime.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.940]   And indeed, that's the case.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.760]   If people are sleep deprived or they're not sleeping enough,
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.600]   things like glucose metabolism, et cetera,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.640]   get really disrupted during the daytime.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.720]   But what this current study shows
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.960]   is that the metabolism that you experience during sleep,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.200]   or to be more specific,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.800]   the range of different types of metabolism
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.320]   that you experience during sleep may serve to tune up
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.160]   or to ensure that the specific aspects of metabolism
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.500]   that you require during wakefulness are working properly.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.800]   In addition to that,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.820]   this study clearly shows that getting enough sleep
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.120]   allows you to transition
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.740]   through all the various forms of metabolism
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.700]   and use all those different forms of metabolites
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.580]   during sleep in a way that's immensely beneficial
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.780]   for the systems of your brain and body.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.940]   So the take-home message here is that, as the authors state,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.640]   sleep and experiencing the different states of sleep,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.860]   slow wave sleep early in the night predominantly,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.100]   plus rapid eye movement sleep toward the end of the night,
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.540]   is extremely important for optimizing metabolic circuits
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.520]   for human performance and health.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.160]   In other words, by not getting sufficient duration sleep,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.800]   you're not allowing your body and brain to transition
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.080]   through all the different aspects of fuel utilization,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.260]   and you're not teaching your brain and body
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.060]   how to use similar types of fuels during wakefulness.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.780]   So again, all of this points to the fact
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.100]   that we need to be getting sufficient quality
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.240]   and duration of sleep.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.160]   So if you're sleep deprived even by an hour or so,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.420]   you're going to get far less rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.600]   because rapid eye movement sleep
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.500]   is what occurs toward the end of a sleep night,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.560]   during the early part of the night,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.740]   far more slow wave sleep.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.440]   In getting less rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.260]   we know it makes you more emotionally labile,
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.100]   but now we know it's also going to alter certain forms
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.720]   of glucose metabolism during the night
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   and during wakefulness.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.760]   So that all underscores the need to get sleep.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.700]   But then the question is how to get enough sleep
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.640]   and how to make sure you get
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.400]   into all these different sleep states.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.820]   And this is particularly important
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.080]   for you so-called night owls.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.900]   There's a lot of controversy out there
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.700]   as to whether or not different so-called chronotypes exist.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.800]   That is people who just naturally
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.680]   or genetically want to be an early bird,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.040]   wake up early and go to bed early.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.520]   So these people that wake up at 4 a.m.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.720]   and would be most comfortable going to bed
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.500]   by 7 or 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.400]   Then there are so-called night owls,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.820]   people that would feel best or tend to feel best
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.720]   when they go to sleep at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., even 3 a.m.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.000]   and like to wake up later, 8, 9, 10,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.920]   or even 11 a.m. or noon.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.200]   And then of course, most people go to sleep somewhere
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.880]   between 10 p.m. and midnight
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.160]   and wake up somewhere between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.000]   Or I suppose more typically 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.120]   Now, whether or not real chronotypes exist
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.080]   or whether or not people simply select schedules
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.340]   for sleep and wakefulness that they like
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.700]   because of their social schedules
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.000]   or the activities they enjoy.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.120]   For instance, some people like to really go out.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.220]   They like to go out dancing or hear music
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.080]   or spend time in venues that are only open late at night
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.440]   and don't even open until noon or after.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   Other people like myself rarely go out at night,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.560]   but I like to get up early, I like to exercise,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.660]   I like to see the sunrise, et cetera.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.280]   So I don't know if I'm a morning person or an evening person,
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.400]   I just know the things I enjoy tend to happen
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.500]   in the early part of the day
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.760]   and the things that I don't enjoy quite as much
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.660]   tend to happen late at night.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.760]   Regardless of whether or not
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.120]   there are real genetic propensities to be a night owl
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.360]   or an early bird
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.880]   or a sort of typical person right there in the middle,
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.800]   it's very important that people have some control
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.840]   over their sleep schedule.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.080]   And even more important,
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.760]   that people are able to get sufficient amount of REM sleep
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.040]   and slow wave sleep for many reasons,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.680]   but including the reasons I discussed
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.140]   in the previous study related to metabolism.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.480]   I'm very excited therefore
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.560]   about a study that came out in sleep medicine.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.800]   This was a few years ago, but somehow I missed this one.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.360]   It was published in 2019.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.800]   And the title of this article
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.040]   is resetting the late timing of night owls
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.960]   has a positive impact on mental health,
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.000]   physical health and performance.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.840]   This is a study done in humans,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.680]   focusing specifically on people
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.480]   that like to stay up late and sleep in,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.880]   but who desire to be able to get up and feel alert
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.520]   in order to go to work or study,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.460]   and they want to go to sleep a bit earlier.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.440]   And so there are a lot of questions embedded in this study,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.280]   in particular,
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.080]   whether or not people can actually shift their schedule
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.840]   by a few hours or more.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.020]   Some people out there contend that if you're a night owl,
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.640]   that's just going to be impossible
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   or very, very challenging to do.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.240]   Turns out it's not impossible,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.680]   and it's not even that challenging to do
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.120]   provided you do the right things.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.580]   Just a brief overview of the study,
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.000]   and then I'll give you the key takeaways.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.920]   It was a randomized control trial.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.600]   It involved a number of different people,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.960]   both male and female.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.160]   And what they did was they used non-pharmacological,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   practical interventions in a real world setting.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.460]   Here I'm paraphrasing.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.840]   They used targeted light exposure.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.620]   They used consistent sleep wake times.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.720]   They used fixed meal times, caffeine intake, and exercise.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.560]   And this is one of the reasons I love this study so much
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.040]   because I've done episodes where I've talked about
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.260]   temperature, exercise, feeding,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.880]   and most importantly, light exposure as a way
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.960]   to control and shift your sleep wake cycles,
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.560]   your so-called circadian timing and entrainment.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.700]   What did they find?
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.440]   Well, they found, quote,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.240]   "Significant improvements in terms of mood,
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.920]   so far less depression and stress,
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.980]   subjectively measured,
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.040]   as well as improved cognitive performance
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.140]   that was objectively measured."
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.600]   So improved reaction times,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.720]   improved physical grip strength,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.540]   which is actually a measure, not just of strength per se,
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.640]   but also of nervous system function.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.460]   And a number of things that people could do
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.520]   in order to optimize their morning hours,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.040]   even though they were night owls previously.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.000]   What do they have people do?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.260]   Well, I'm just going to list this off
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.440]   in sort of a rapid fire succession.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.840]   Then we'll provide a link to the study
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.880]   if you want to learn more.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.040]   First of all, they told participants
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.240]   to try and wake up two to three hours
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.880]   before their typical wake-up time.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.720]   Two to three hours.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.640]   That seems brutal to me and probably seems brutal to you
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   if you're somebody who typically wakes up at 10 a.m.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.120]   to try and get up at eight or even seven a.m. consistently.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   But they were also asked to maximize
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.560]   at outdoor light exposure during the mornings
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.920]   for reasons that if you've listened to this podcast before,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.000]   if you've heard me talk about before,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.360]   that I'm constantly talking about,
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.840]   I'll probably go into the grave shouting,
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.600]   "Please get as much light exposure
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   from sunlight early in the day as possible
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.760]   because it sets in motion a huge number of things
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.300]   that are beneficial for your mental health
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.840]   and physical health, including dopamine production,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.160]   timing melatonin production correctly,
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.780]   reducing cortisol peaks late in the day, et cetera, et cetera."
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.520]   So they asked them to get a lot of outdoor light exposure.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.120]   They didn't give them a specific amount,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.360]   where they said maximize outdoor light exposure
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.520]   during the mornings, the time before noon.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.360]   And again, they had them waking up two to three hours
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.280]   before their habitual wake-up time.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.400]   They were also told, and this is very important
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.200]   if you're going to shift your schedule earlier,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.220]   to try and keep sleep-wake times fixed
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.680]   between their workdays and their weekends.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.360]   So not sleeping in on the weekends
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.120]   or not having any sleep-in days,
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.840]   regardless of how well they slept the night before.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.760]   How fixed?
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.420]   Within 15 to 30 minutes of their predesignated time.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.040]   So if they were waking up at seven o'clock one day,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.000]   they set their alarm and they made sure they got out of bed
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.360]   at seven o'clock every day, plus or minus 30 minutes,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.520]   but never later than 7.30, never earlier than 6.30.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.200]   Participants were also asked to try and go to sleep
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   two to three hours before their habitual bedtime.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.080]   So again, these are people that want to stay up late,
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.000]   like 11 p.m. perhaps, but even as late as 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.960]   and now they are asked to go to sleep two to three hours
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.780]   before their habitual bedtime
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.400]   and to wake up two to three hours earlier,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.560]   as I mentioned earlier.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.280]   They were also told, and I love this
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.200]   because it fits with many of the things we've talked about
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.720]   on this podcast before,
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.820]   to try and limit light exposure during the evenings.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.800]   Dim the lights or limit altogether artificial lights.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.860]   Lot of reasons for that.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.560]   I covered that in the master sleep episode.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.720]   I covered that in the optimize health using light episode.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.840]   You can find those at hubermanlab.com.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.520]   They're asking them to do that here.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.920]   And they asked participants to keep a regular schedule
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.120]   for their daily meals, not eating on the hour consistently,
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   you know, at 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m. exactly,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.220]   but within, again, about 15 to 30 minutes,
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.320]   they're always eating at the same times.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.560]   That was also important.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.680]   And again, that's because we have these so-called
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.480]   food-entrained circadian clocks.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.440]   When you eat tells your body when to be alert
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.240]   and when you're not eating, when to be asleep.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.120]   And they were told to not drink any caffeine
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.200]   after 3 p.m. in the afternoon,
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.540]   another theme that we've talked about on this podcast.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.840]   They were also told not to take naps after 4 p.m.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.140]   Naps are an interesting feature of the sleep-wake cycle.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.280]   To be very brief about this and to pull from the episode
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.100]   that I did with world sleep expert
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.960]   from University of California, Berkeley, Matt Walker,
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.140]   naps are great for many people,
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.000]   but don't nap if it interferes with your nighttime sleep.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.520]   And in this study, they told them don't nap after 4 p.m.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.920]   And if you are a napper, don't nap for more than 90 minutes.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.120]   10 minute naps are fine, 20 minute naps are fine,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.800]   zero minute naps are fine,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.700]   but don't nap for more than 90 minutes
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.140]   and don't nap after 4 p.m.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.820]   And to exercise during the morning.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.440]   Now, this one can be a bit controversial
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.260]   because I know a lot of the PTs out there
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.900]   and a lot of the online gym rats and people who,
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.080]   and runners too, for that matter, will say,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.280]   well, according to body temperature and research,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.080]   it's best to exercise in the afternoon.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.160]   Look, it's better to exercise sometime as opposed to no time,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.400]   but if you're focused on how to shift your schedule earlier,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.240]   meaning get up early and go to sleep earlier,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.760]   this study had people exercise in the early part of the day,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.680]   certainly before 2 p.m. and ideally before noon.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.220]   So again, this is a really important study
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.380]   because it combines a lot of different variables
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.600]   to arrive at this very impressive shift
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.860]   where people can get up two to three hours earlier
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.680]   and then pretty consistently and reflexively
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.440]   start going to bed two to three hours earlier,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.760]   feeling more alert during the day.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.460]   Again, improvements in cognitive performance,
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.040]   mood and physical performance, grip strength, et cetera.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.600]   Very few studies are able to or willing to tackle
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.920]   so many variables and combine them in one study.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.540]   This paper, I think, does a marvelous job of doing this
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.960]   and is incorporating things that individually
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.580]   each have some support for them in animal studies
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.000]   and previous human studies.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.240]   But as far as I know, this is one of the few studies
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.080]   that really combines all these different features
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.220]   in one place, eating times, keeping those consistent,
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.200]   getting maximal sunlight exposure earlier in the day,
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.640]   getting up at a consistent time,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.180]   going to sleep at a consistent time and on and on.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.880]   It's a really marvelous study for that reason.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.280]   And I think for any of you that are night owls
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.720]   and any of you that want to reinforce your early waking
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.320]   and early to bedtimes, and I think for most all of you
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.520]   who fall into that general middle category
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.720]   of tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10 p.m.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.080]   and midnight, 'cause that's most people,
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.600]   and tend to wake up sometime between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.520]   well, maybe you want to become more of an early riser
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.160]   or maybe you're going to travel
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.140]   or the seasons are changing and you want to shift your time
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.920]   or you have a new job, et cetera,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   or something that's actually very common
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.000]   in terms of relationship struggle.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.560]   You want to match your awake sleep times
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.000]   or maybe you want to offset your awake sleep times
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.100]   from a significant other.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.260]   These sorts of approaches that I described here
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.900]   and that are supported by the data in this paper
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.700]   are absolutely powerful and science supported.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.180]   And I'm certain that if you were to apply them
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.240]   that you would see essentially the same effects
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.180]   that were observed here.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.760]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.280]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.920]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.500]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.560]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.080]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.560]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.280]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.780]   that also includes adaptogens
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.580]   and digestive enzymes for health.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.580]   Now, the probiotics are particularly important to me
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.400]   because there is now a wealth of data
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.900]   showing that our gut microbiome,
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.720]   that is trillions of little microbacteria
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.600]   that are good for us, impact our immune system,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.480]   our hormones, and the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.540]   the connections between our gut and our brain
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.760]   that go in both directions, gut to brain and brain to gut,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   that control things like our mood,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.080]   our ability to think clearly and focus,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.900]   and overall brain health.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.840]   And with AG1, I'm able to optimize that gut-brain axis
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.320]   through the probiotics and the vitamins, minerals,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.260]   adaptogens, and digestive enzymes
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.860]   support a number of other things
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.440]   that relate to immediate and long-term health.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.000]   In fact, anytime people ask me
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.920]   what's the one supplement they should take,
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.240]   I say AG1 Athletic Greens
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.660]   because it's going to cover all of your bases
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.560]   to the greatest degree.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.920]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.600]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.700]   to claim a special offer.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.480]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.520]   that make it easy to mix up AG1 while you're on the road,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.620]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.540]   Vitamin D3 and K2 are important
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.240]   for cardiovascular function, calcium regulation,
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.600]   and a number of other important aspects of health.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.920]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.500]   to claim that special offer of the five free travel packs
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.400]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.920]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.240]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.400]   And frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.840]   I've said that on various podcasts
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.960]   and on social media posts.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.720]   And the reason I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.520]   is it means smart drugs.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.020]   But as a neuroscientist, I know that we don't have circuits
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.820]   in the brain or chemicals in the brain for being smart.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.980]   We have circuits in the brain for focus
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.980]   and for task switching and for creativity.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.340]   And oftentimes those circuits differ from one another,
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.060]   although they collaborate to create things
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.280]   that we think of as intelligence or focus
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.060]   or creativity, et cetera.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.140]   Thesis understands this, and for that reason
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.900]   has developed custom nootropics
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.800]   that are matched to your particular goals
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.200]   and to your particular biology.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.300]   They give you the opportunity to try several different blends
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.740]   over the course of a month and discover
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.520]   which ones work best for you and which ones don't.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.060]   In addition to that personalization,
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.440]   they take it a step further by offering free consultations
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.860]   with a coach to help you optimize your experience
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.220]   and dial in your perfect formulas.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.540]   I've been using Thesis for about eight months now,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.880]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.660]   are the best that I've ever used.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.940]   My go-to formula is the clarity formula
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.980]   or the motivation formula when I'm going to work or workout,
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.100]   meaning I'm going to do focus cognitive work
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.160]   or I'm going to exercise.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.840]   I also like their energy formula prior to exercise.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.000]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.560]   You can take a three-minute quiz that will help match you
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.760]   to the best custom nootropics to start with,
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.900]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.280]   to try in that first month.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.000]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.920]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.640]   that analyzes data from your blood and your DNA
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.160]   to help you better understand your body
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.080]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.880]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   for the simple reason that many of the things
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.080]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   can only be measured from a quality blood test.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.560]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.940]   you can also get insight into, for instance,
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.320]   what is your biological age
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.400]   and how does that compare to your chronological age?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.920]   And of course your biological age
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.480]   is really the one that matters.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.560]   With Inside Tracker, there's an additional advantage
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.360]   over other blood tests and DNA tests.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.160]   And that is with many blood tests and DNA tests out there,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.520]   you get information back about hormones, lipids, et cetera,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.280]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.440]   With Inside Tracker, they have a very simple,
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.920]   easy to use personalized platform that tells you
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.280]   what sorts of changes to make in your nutrition,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.080]   possible changes to supplementation,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.680]   behavioral changes, et cetera,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.160]   that will allow you to bring the numbers related
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.000]   to your hormones and your lipids, et cetera,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.440]   into the ranges that are optimal for your mental health,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.300]   physical health, and performance goals.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.780]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.800]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.280]   Let's talk about how to optimize
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.360]   and indeed how to control your brain chemistry
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.800]   for sake of health and performance.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.600]   Now, in order to do that,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.040]   we all need to be on the same page about some basic facts.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.640]   Some of those basic facts involve learning some basic biology
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.920]   and I promise that even if you don't have a biology
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.460]   or chemistry background, everything I'm about to say
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.620]   should be accessible and clear to you.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.000]   The important thing to know is that your brain
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.800]   and your spinal cord
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.120]   and the rest of your so-called nervous system
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.180]   control all the organs of your body
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.120]   and that all the organs of your body feed back,
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.160]   meaning they communicate through chemicals
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.880]   and other means to your nervous system.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.120]   Now, your nervous system plays a particularly important role
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.740]   in generating everything from sleep to wakefulness,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.640]   creativity, stress, calm, et cetera,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.400]   by way of a particular type of cell-cell interaction
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.860]   and that's called synaptic communication.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.560]   What is synaptic communication?
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.780]   Well, in order to understand that,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.620]   let's dial back a little bit further
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.800]   and try and understand for a moment
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.240]   what makes up your nervous system.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.840]   In its simplest form, your nervous system
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.540]   is made of nerve cells that we call neurons.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.800]   Neurons communicate with one another through chemicals.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.240]   They release certain chemicals that make other neurons
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.480]   more or less likely to be electrically active.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.240]   What do we mean by electrically active?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.840]   We mean, as it sounds,
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.280]   electricity passing down through cells
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   and then literally causing electricity in other cells.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.800]   The simplest way to think about this
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.320]   is maybe when you were a kid or maybe even still now,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.800]   you would wear socks and you'd shuffle along the floor
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.500]   to generate some static electricity
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.720]   and then you touch someone
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.800]   and you'd shock them with your finger.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.640]   I'm a younger brother,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.680]   so I'd occasionally do that to my sister.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.360]   I had friends, we would do that to one another.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.560]   I know it's kind of silly and childish,
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.220]   yet it illustrates the principle
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.280]   that we can generate electricity
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.240]   and pass electricity to other beings
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.080]   or in the case of neurons, from one neuron to the next.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.520]   The way neurons do that is that in between the neurons,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.400]   they're little spaces.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.000]   Those little spaces are called synapses
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.040]   and neurons literally vomit.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.340]   Well, they don't literally vomit,
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.600]   but they release little packets
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   of so-called transmitter chemical
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.660]   into that space we call a synapse.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.680]   It travels across the synapse.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.080]   It attaches to the cell on the other side, the other neuron.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.320]   And then depending on what that chemical is,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.800]   it either makes that next neuron more electrically active
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.740]   or less electrically active, so-called excitation.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.640]   It either excites the next neuron
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.800]   to be electrically active also,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.200]   or it inhibits, it prevents the next neuron
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.400]   from being electrically active.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.220]   So again, very simply, we have nerve cells
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.440]   that communicate with one another
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.600]   through electricity and chemicals
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.540]   that inspire that electricity.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.580]   And the little gaps between neurons are called synapses.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.760]   If you can understand that,
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.720]   I'm certain you can make it through the rest of the episode
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.920]   and that you will get all the depth
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.480]   and important detail that you need to know.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.540]   But I want to go just a little bit further
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.160]   and explain that neurons don't just talk one-to-one.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.900]   There are trillions of neurons in your nervous system
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.920]   that allow you to be happy, to be in love, to be sad,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.880]   to be in grief, to remember things, and so on.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.740]   And what you do at any moment,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.140]   what you feel and what you think,
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.860]   relates to which so-called neural circuits are active.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.760]   So a lot of times we think about brain areas,
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.240]   and we've all seen these pictures of the brain
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.080]   where someone was in a fMRI scanner,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.420]   or they were in a brain scanner of some sort,
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.320]   and they saw a picture of something
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.600]   and a certain area of the brain lights up, as it's called.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.120]   That lighting up of the brain really reflects the activity
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.520]   of hundreds, if not thousands,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.920]   maybe even millions of neurons in that region.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.400]   Those images of brain areas lighting up,
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.700]   and indeed talking about brain areas lighting up,
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.500]   can be a little bit or a lot misleading,
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.800]   because in fact, no single brain area
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.540]   controls any one single perception
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.520]   or behavior or feeling state.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.000]   Rather, we have so-called neural circuits,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.720]   chains of neurons, chains of specific neurons, that is,
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.160]   that create different states of mind
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.360]   that lead to specific behaviors,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.180]   that lead to specific emotional states.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.940]   And those neural circuits are made up
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.440]   of lots of different brain areas
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.360]   that light up in particular sequences.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.760]   And when I say light up, excuse me,
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.240]   what I mean is that particular brain areas
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.760]   either excite or prevent the excitation,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.900]   that is, they inhibit other brain areas
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.520]   in a particular sequence.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.200]   Much like keys on a piano played in a particular sequence
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.120]   makes up a particular song,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.040]   particular brain areas activated or made silent
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.940]   in a particular sequence leads to a particular behavior,
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.640]   like getting up out of a chair,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.500]   or a particular feeling state,
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.200]   like being particularly happy one day when you wake up,
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.940]   or particularly depressed,
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.040]   whether or not that depression is caused by a life event
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.580]   or whether or not it arises spontaneously.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.500]   So we have neurons, we have synapses,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.100]   and we have neural circuits.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.680]   And vitally important is the fact
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.900]   that which neural circuits are active
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.160]   and which neural circuits are likely to be less active
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.880]   at any given moment
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.680]   depends on two major categories of chemicals.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   It depends on hormones
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.400]   and it depends on so-called neuromodulators.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.820]   Now, we're mainly going to focus on neuromodulators today
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.280]   because those are the things
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.140]   that if you can learn to control them,
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.480]   and indeed there are tools to control them,
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.920]   then you can control which neural circuits
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.960]   are more likely or less likely to be active in you
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.100]   at any given moment.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.780]   And in doing so, you can control
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.560]   whether or not you are going to be alert and focused
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.040]   or deeply asleep.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.440]   You can control whether or not
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.240]   you are going to be in a creative state
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.560]   or whether or not you're going to be in a state of mind,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.200]   more fit, more capable that is of doing focused work
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.720]   or math or more so-called linear types of work
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.920]   where there's a correct answer.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.100]   There's a specific thing to follow
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.800]   and you're simply going to plug and chug as it were
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.140]   through a particular set of steps
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.400]   in order to accomplish something.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.000]   Or for instance, whether or not
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.620]   you're going to be in a more relaxed and creative state
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.700]   where you're thinking about new ideas
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.560]   or new ideas are just seem to be
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.760]   spontaneously coming to mind.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   All of that can be controlled to a considerable extent
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.100]   by leveraging these so-called neuromodulators.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.800]   What are neuromodulators?
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.040]   Neuromodulators are particular chemicals
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.840]   that make it likely that certain neural circuits
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.760]   will be active and not others.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.480]   And the four neuromodulators
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.800]   that we're going to talk about today
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.520]   that are of the utmost importance for your goals
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.360]   are dopamine, epinephrine, also called adrenaline,
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.320]   serotonin, and acetylcholine.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.180]   That's dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.220]   Today, I'm going to teach you
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.140]   how each of those different categories
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.280]   of neuromodulators work and the things that you can do
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.200]   to control those neuromodulators,
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.360]   that is increase them or decrease them
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.600]   through behavioral tools and supplementation
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.120]   in ways that allow you to access the brain and body states
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.700]   that you want at the times that you want.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.680]   Just very quickly,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.040]   I want to talk about how neuromodulators are able to work
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.720]   regardless of whether or not it's dopamine or serotonin
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.440]   or epinephrine, et cetera.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.340]   There are many features of how neuromodulators work,
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.560]   but for sake of today's discussion,
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.040]   we only need to focus on two of those features.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.480]   And those are fast acting features
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.360]   and longer slower features
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.980]   or what we call baseline features.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.680]   What am I talking about when I say faster or baseline?
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.760]   Well, consider that at any given moment,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.380]   whether or not you're asleep or awake,
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.880]   whether or not it's morning or afternoon or night,
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.200]   you have some amount of dopamine being released
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.040]   in your brain and body, some amount of serotonin,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.680]   some amount of epinephrine,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.560]   and some amount of acetylcholine.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.260]   It is rarely, if ever the case,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.840]   that you have zero dopamine or zero serotonin.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.420]   So often we hear about someone being dopamine depleted,
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.680]   or these days you hear a lot about that anyways,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.640]   or you'll hear that people's serotonin is bottomed out.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.840]   In reality, none of these neuromodulators
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.200]   ever disappear completely,
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.060]   but they tend to be present at different levels
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.920]   or different relative levels.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.620]   Another important thing to point out
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.060]   is that they don't work alone.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.680]   In fact, as you'll soon learn,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.340]   dopamine and epinephrine are close cousins that collaborate
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.540]   in terms of creating states of focus and motivation,
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.060]   for instance, or in creating states of energy
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.280]   and the pursuit of particular goals.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.340]   When I say they're close cousins,
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.800]   what I mean is that they tend to impact
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.120]   some of the same neural circuits.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.260]   And believe it or not,
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.760]   dopamine and epinephrine are chemically related too.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.780]   I'll just tell you right now that epinephrine
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.980]   is actually derived from dopamine chemically.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.860]   Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.700]   is made from the molecule dopamine.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.260]   Now, dopamine and serotonin can also work together
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.260]   to impact certain circuits in the brain,
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.060]   but in large part, they operate on separate circuits.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.240]   And acetylcholine, which you'll soon learn
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.380]   is involved in states of focus and can actually open up.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.480]   It can literally create states in the mind
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.700]   in which your brain is more plastic
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.320]   and able to change and learn more quickly.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.740]   Well, acetylcholine can do that on its own,
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.180]   but rarely does it do it on its own.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.380]   More typically, it gets assistance
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.260]   from some of the other neuromodulators.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.020]   Now, that might seem like it complicates the picture,
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.320]   but it actually makes the picture far simpler
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.380]   because what we can say for sure
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.820]   is that the fast actions of dopamine
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.580]   or the fast actions of epinephrine,
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.860]   serotonin or acetylcholine are actions that occur
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.940]   on the order of seconds or minutes
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.980]   or up to about an hour or so.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.220]   Whereas the slower actions of those neuromodulators
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.300]   tend to occur on the order of hours, days or even weeks.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.620]   Now, perhaps surprisingly,
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.460]   I'd like to focus on the slow actions
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.380]   of the neuromodulators first,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.260]   because those slow actions of the neuromodulators
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.200]   are happening in you and in me and in everyone right now.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.020]   And they set the backdrop, the context
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.040]   in which the various tools to manipulate dopamine,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.660]   epinephrine, serotonin or acetylcholine will work.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.900]   What do I mean by the context or the backdrop
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.020]   or the baseline?
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.500]   Well, it's fair to say that most people
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.660]   are awake during the daytime and asleep at night.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.300]   I do realize that there are people
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.340]   who are going to be doing shift work
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.200]   or they're raising young children,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.880]   or that might have a sick person at home
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.180]   that they're tending to, et cetera,
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.780]   or even have insomnia, they're tending to them.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.080]   So schedules of sleep and wakefulness will vary,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.100]   but in general, everybody,
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.240]   regardless of whether or not you're nocturnal
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.500]   or you're so-called diurnal, you're awake during the day,
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.460]   pretty much everybody follows a schedule
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.460]   in which from zero to nine hours after waking,
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.060]   that is from the time you wake up
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.260]   until about nine hours later,
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:32.380]   the neuromodulators dopamine and epinephrine
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.340]   tend to be at their highest levels
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.060]   that they will be at any point in the 24 hour period,
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.060]   in any period of the day.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.260]   So we can call this zero to nine hour period phase one
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.580]   of the day, just for simplicity.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.780]   And I've referred to this before in a previous episode,
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.220]   but not in this exact context.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:57.020]   From nine to about 16 hours is what we will call phase two.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.260]   And that's when dopamine and epinephrine levels
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.220]   tend to subside a bit compared to the earlier phase one
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.860]   part of the day, and serotonin levels start to increase.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.900]   And then phase three of the 24 hour cycle,
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.680]   which is from about, and again,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.380]   about the zero approximates,
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.380]   from about 17 hours after waking
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:22.380]   until about 24 hours after waking is phase three of the day.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.580]   And during that time, there is chaos
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.740]   in terms of which neuromodulators
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.300]   are most present in the brain.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.540]   And why chaos, what I mean is that during sleep,
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.840]   you have incredible peaks in acetylcholine
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.900]   and drops in acetylcholine.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.520]   You have incredible peaks in dopamine and drops in dopamine.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.260]   You have incredible peaks in serotonin
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.120]   and drops in serotonin.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.140]   Most often, you are not going to see much,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.380]   if any, release of epinephrine, adrenaline.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.840]   And that's because epinephrine, also called adrenaline,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:59.060]   tends to wake us up and put us into action mode behaviors.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.160]   And that's simply not happening during sleep.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.460]   But for the other three neuromodulators,
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.620]   across the night, it's sort of chaos.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.580]   You've got peaks and drops and peaks and drops
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.700]   in different combinations
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.360]   than you would ever see in wakefulness.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.260]   And this plays important roles in dreaming,
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.780]   important roles in some of the reparative functions of sleep.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.160]   The point is that during that phase three,
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.560]   the levels of neuromodulators are all over the place,
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.780]   but it's not random, right?
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.860]   I say it's chaos,
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.340]   but it's organized according
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.620]   to the specific reparative goals of sleep,
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.580]   the specific metabolic roles of sleep, et cetera.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.500]   We're not going to focus too much on phase three today,
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.620]   because phase three of the 24 hour cycle,
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.480]   that 17 to 24 hour period,
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.860]   is one in which you ought to be deeply asleep,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.860]   whether or not you're nocturnal or diurnal, right?
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.900]   17 hours after waking, you ought to be asleep.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.380]   And there are a lot of episodes of this podcast,
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.260]   and indeed today I started talking
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.880]   about two particular studies related to sleep.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.760]   There are a lot of tools to enhance sleep, et cetera.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.300]   And of course, there are things that you can do
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.000]   in the late portion of phase two of the day
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.680]   in order to enhance your transition time
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.420]   into and depth of sleep.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.040]   But you can't really do much during sleep, right?
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.200]   You're not taking supplements,
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.220]   you're not doing breathing practices.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.540]   There are things to fall back asleep,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.900]   but you're not really doing much during sleep.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.540]   So we're mainly going to focus
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.580]   on what we're calling phase one and phase two.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.020]   Phase one being this dopamine epinephrine dominated phase
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.700]   of our day, and phase two being this more serotonergic
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.020]   or serotonin dominated portion of the day.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.980]   And then you might say, well, what about acetylcholine?
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.100]   Forgot about acetylcholine.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.700]   Well, we didn't forget about acetylcholine.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.620]   Acetylcholine is under control more in terms
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.900]   of what we happen to be doing at any given moment,
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.720]   whether or not we're focusing or not focusing,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.180]   whether or not we're learning or not learning.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.260]   And here I'm referring to acetylcholine specifically
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.700]   in the context of the brain and thinking,
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.700]   because as some of you are probably shouting out there,
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.580]   right, if you're exercise physiologists
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.260]   or you know anything about how the brain controls movement,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.840]   acetylcholine is used at the nerve to muscle synapse, right?
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.360]   So neurons don't just control other neurons electrically.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.100]   The way you're able to move in fact is
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.620]   because neurons are controlling the electric activity
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.460]   of muscles, literally the contraction of muscle fibers,
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.320]   and that control is exerted
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.660]   through the release of acetylcholine.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.660]   So acetylcholine is working at muscles as well,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.460]   but we're not focused on that today.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.780]   We're focused on what we can do during phase one of the day
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.060]   and what we can do during phase two of the day
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.220]   to control the specific neuromodulators,
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.000]   dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.920]   toward particular end goals.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.900]   And as I've been harping on for the last five
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.180]   or 10 minutes or so, it is important to understand
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.400]   that in the early phase one part of the day,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.440]   again, zero to nine hours,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.700]   dopamine and epinephrine already dominate
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.740]   the neuromodulator landscape.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.740]   That is, they are already elevated
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.700]   and then they will taper off in phase two.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.340]   Whereas in phase two of the day,
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.520]   serotonin tends to dominate more than dopamine
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.580]   and epinephrine.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.000]   And so if you think about that,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.620]   what it means is that if your goal is to increase serotonin
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.460]   in order to get some particular effect
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:19.060]   on your mental performance or physical performance or health,
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.900]   or if your goal is to increase your dopamine
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.240]   or epinephrine to get some particular effect
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.580]   on your mental health, physical performance, et cetera,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.220]   well, then you need to consider what the background level
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.980]   of dopamine or epinephrine or serotonin happens to be.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.860]   Because in doing so, you will know which tool to select
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.980]   and how hard you need to push on that tool, right?
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.140]   If your levels of dopamine are already riding pretty high
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.040]   because it's the early part of the day,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.960]   well, then it doesn't take a whole lot more
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.300]   to get dopamine to a level in which it can, for instance,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.080]   change your level of motivation.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.320]   Whereas if you are in the late part of the day,
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.480]   let's say eight or 9 p.m.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.300]   and you have a lot of serotonin swimming around
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   in your system and you really need to be focused and alert,
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.800]   well, you can do that by leveraging the dopamine
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.780]   and epinephrine system
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.020]   and indeed the acetylcholine system too,
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.800]   but you're going to have to resort to tools
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.220]   that can do that far more potently
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.500]   and that can do that in a much more sustained way
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.060]   if you're going to access the state that you want.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.340]   So again, it's really important to understand
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.820]   what the backdrop of these neuromodulators is,
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.460]   the so-called baseline, and that they vary across the day
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.740]   if you're going to be able to leverage tools
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.620]   to optimize your brain chemistry.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.900]   Anyone that tells you do this protocol
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.460]   in order to increase your dopamine,
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.660]   do this protocol or take this supplement
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.580]   to increase your serotonin,
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.920]   they can be telling you the absolute truth,
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.140]   but if you don't consider the backdrop
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.480]   over which that supplement or behavior
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.240]   is going to have its effect,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.800]   well, then you can't really predict the effect it will have,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.560]   but if you can understand these backdrop baseline elements
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.240]   to how neuromodulators work,
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.900]   well, then you're in a terrific position
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.120]   to leverage the best tools in the immediate and short-term
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.940]   and that is on the order of seconds, minutes, and hours.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.160]   Before we dive into the more pointed,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.080]   directed effects of specific tools on neuromodulators,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.180]   I'd like to just briefly mention hormones
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.780]   because they are also important for understanding
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.460]   the background and the context
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.540]   and these baseline levels of neuromodulators.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.460]   Now, here I'm going to paint with a bit of a broad brush,
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.040]   but what I will say is accurate,
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.060]   even though it might not be exhaustive.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.920]   What I mean by that is everything I'm about to say is true,
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.280]   but it doesn't cover every example in detail
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.760]   and nuanced possibility out there.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.000]   Hormones have many different effects on the brain and body
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.520]   and not unlike neuromodulators,
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.600]   some of those effects are very fast,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.080]   some of them are very slow.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.980]   In fact, certain hormones, for instance,
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.240]   the steroid hormones like estrogen
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.940]   and like testosterone and corticosterones,
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.740]   and here, of course,
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.120]   I'm referring to the steroid hormones for what they are,
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.880]   they are indeed steroid hormones,
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   but I'm not talking about steroids that people inject
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.280]   for sports performance or for physical augmentation,
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.020]   I'm talking about the steroid hormones
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.040]   that you make naturally
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.400]   because indeed you make these naturally.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.420]   Well, the steroid hormones
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.520]   can actually control gene expression,
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.360]   they can change the identity of cells
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.240]   and the genes and proteins that cells express.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.520]   This is why during puberty, for instance,
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.120]   testosterone and estrogen are released into the body,
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.900]   growth hormone is released into the body
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.600]   and bodies and voices and personalities and brains
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.160]   change tremendously because literally
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.760]   there is a transformation of the breast tissue,
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   of the testicular tissue, of the ovarian tissue,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.880]   of the bones, of the muscles,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.500]   of the tissues and cells that control hair growth.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.720]   Gene expression changes in all those cell types
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.240]   and the child becomes an adolescent,
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.120]   becomes a young adult, right?
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.740]   That's what puberty really is.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.600]   In fact, puberty is perhaps the most dramatic transformation
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.400]   that we go through in our entire lifespan
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.920]   in terms of our aging,
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.180]   'cause indeed it reflects a very rapid,
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.960]   I should mention, period of aging
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.780]   and transformation of the identity of cells.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.440]   So steroid hormones and other hormones
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.100]   can have very slow, long lasting actions in that way.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.240]   They can also have very fast actions.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.880]   So for instance, adrenaline epinephrine
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.480]   released from the adrenal glands
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.680]   can immediately make your heart beat faster,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.620]   can immediately change the circumference
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.000]   of your blood vessels and arteries
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.540]   and capillaries and change the way blood flows.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.980]   It can change the way you see the world, literally.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.620]   It does change the way you see the world
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.840]   through your visual system.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.400]   And that all happens on the order
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.120]   of hundreds of milliseconds or seconds.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.440]   These are extremely fast actions.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.440]   Corticosteroid also can have fast actions and slow actions.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.960]   But since this isn't a discussion about hormones per se,
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.220]   and we've done entire episodes
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.960]   like the optimized testosterone and estrogen episode,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.680]   you can find that at hubermanlab.com
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.040]   where the interview with the incredibly knowledgeable
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   and clear and really wonderful tutor
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.400]   of actionable information, Dr. Kyle Gillette,
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.440]   who is also on this podcast.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.280]   You can learn a lot about hormones there.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.640]   Today, we want to think about hormones
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.480]   as they relate to these neuromodulators,
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.160]   the dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.600]   And in general, testosterone tends to collaborate
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.200]   with and increase the action of dopamine.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.560]   That's not always the case, but in general,
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.680]   when testosterone goes up, dopamine goes up.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.460]   And sometimes even vice versa,
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.520]   when dopamine goes up, testosterone go up.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.760]   And this is true for both males and for females.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:55.440]   In general, when corticosterones like cortisol
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   and some related steroid hormones increase,
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.380]   epinephrine levels go up.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.480]   And in general, when hormones like oxytocin
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   or prolactin are increased, levels of serotonin go up.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.400]   We can't draw a direct link
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.040]   between any one hormone system and acetylcholine.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.280]   Acetylcholine kind of sits off
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.460]   in a category of its own in that way.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.900]   But again, in general, testosterone and dopamine
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.600]   tend to collaborate in the same direction.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.640]   Cortisol and epinephrine tend to collaborate
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.720]   in the same direction.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.240]   Oxytocin and prolactin, which are hormones,
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.680]   and serotonin tend to collaborate in the same direction.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.020]   And then we have poor old lonely acetylcholine
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.720]   off on its own, but it's not poor and lonely.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.760]   It actually has incredibly potent effects on its own.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.920]   So it's really that it just doesn't need much help
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.000]   from the hormone systems,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.720]   or at least not the steroid hormone systems
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.160]   in order to have its tremendous effects.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.400]   Now, a lot of what people think about and will do
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   when trying to improve mental health and physical health
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.200]   is they will try and increase or decrease
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.920]   certain categories of hormones
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.960]   of the sort that I mentioned, testosterone, estrogen,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.900]   oxytocin, prolactin, and so on.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:08.760]   But oftentimes the effects of those manipulations in hormones
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.080]   that are going to be most salient
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.000]   are not going to be due to the direct effects
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.060]   of those hormones.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.420]   Sometimes it could be,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.140]   but oftentimes it's going to be due to their effects
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.880]   on the brain and nervous system
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.060]   by way of how those hormones impact neuromodulators.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.660]   So for instance, there are various things
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.240]   that people can do, both men and women,
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.700]   to increase their testosterone and estrogen
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.480]   in the appropriate ratios.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.460]   I talked about one such approach in a previous episode,
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.060]   and that is to get sunlight onto a large portion
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.720]   of one's skin each day.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.800]   Believe it or not, this actually works,
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.120]   and it works because your skin
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.880]   is actually an endocrine organ, a hormone secreting organ.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.720]   It's a beautiful study.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.320]   I've covered it on this podcast before.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.040]   We will provide a link to this study again,
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.040]   but it had people spend at least 20 minutes or so
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.560]   closer to 30 minutes each day
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.500]   trying to maximize sunlight exposure
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.120]   to as much of their skin as they could
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.400]   in terms of still maintaining decent exposure,
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.940]   meaning not overexposing themselves in a cultural way,
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.040]   meaning wearing enough clothes that they were decent,
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.560]   but still getting a lot of sun exposure
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.360]   a couple of times per week or more.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.240]   What they found was that people's testosterone
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.640]   and estrogen levels went up,
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.160]   feelings of wellbeing went up,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.640]   feelings of well, or I should say increases in libido
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.440]   were observed as well.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.300]   They subjectively reported more passion, et cetera.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.380]   Testosterone and estrogen did indeed both go up.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.420]   And again, I want to highlight that increases in estrogen,
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.440]   not just testosterone,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.200]   are related to increases in libido in both men and women.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.040]   This is why you never want to crush your estrogen
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.400]   down to zero, whether or not you're male or female,
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.880]   if you want to maintain some sort of healthy libido
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.960]   and general feelings of wellbeing unrelated to libido.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.340]   Well, many of those effects we know
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.640]   are not due to direct effects of testosterone and estrogen,
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.080]   but rather are due to the effects of testosterone
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.140]   and estrogen on the neuromodulators, dopamine and serotonin,
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.480]   because much of libido and feelings of wellbeing
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.740]   and feelings of relaxation,
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.400]   but also desire, motivation, et cetera,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.520]   originate because of the activation of neural circuits
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.200]   that dopamine controls and promotes,
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.560]   and that serotonin promote and control.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   So this is very important to understand
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.440]   as we move toward more specific discussion of the chemicals
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.380]   that we call neuromodulators,
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:38.280]   because hormones are controlling those neuromodulators
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.040]   in a very slow modulatory way.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:45.560]   So yes, I said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:48.040]   I sort of said it twice on purpose.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.220]   And this is a dramatic and potent effect.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.840]   So I'll just give you one more example.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.060]   The hormone prolactin tends to be antagonistic.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.300]   It tends to reduce amounts of dopamine
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.140]   or at least when prolactin levels are high,
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.520]   dopamine levels tend to be lower.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.140]   You observe this after the birth of a new child,
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.900]   you observe this postcoitally after mating
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.580]   in all species, humans and animals.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:17.740]   When prolactin is elevated, serotonin tends to be elevated.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.300]   And when prolactin is elevated, levels of dopamine
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:26.060]   and the effects of dopamine tend to subside.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.940]   Now, as I move toward explaining
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.120]   what each of the four categories of neuromodulators do,
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.660]   this will start to make more and more sense
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.320]   as to why this would be.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.260]   I always say I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.500]   meaning I didn't design these circuits.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.880]   And if anyone tells you that they did,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.280]   you should back away quickly
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.180]   because none of us designed these circuits.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.500]   This is the way that evolution and nature
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.800]   created these systems.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.120]   And they tend to work in a bit of a seesaw fashion,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.980]   prolactin up, dopamine down, right?
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.640]   Dopamine up, prolactin down.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.180]   In general, that is the way they work.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.260]   So if we are to take a look at how each of these
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.060]   neuromodulator systems functions on its own,
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.480]   while understanding that they never truly function
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.340]   on their own, we can start to really make sense
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.620]   of the landscape of tools that are available to us
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.720]   and which tools are going to be most powerful to select
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.320]   if our goal is, for instance, to be focused,
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.980]   or if our goal is to be less stressed,
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.720]   or if our goal is to be highly motivated
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.680]   and highly focused for sake of learning.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   All of that is indeed possible
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   if you understand these four neuromodulators
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.320]   and you understand that while there are many tools
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.220]   ranging from pharmacologic to behavioral
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.180]   that can tap into these neuromodulator systems
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.620]   that can kind of press on the gas of dopamine,
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.000]   pull back on serotonin and so on,
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.700]   but that there are particular tools,
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.660]   both behavioral and supplementation-based,
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.440]   and to some extent, prescription drug-based too,
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.480]   and we'll touch on a few of those.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.040]   If you understand that and why they work,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.860]   well, then you can create a sort of kit,
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.980]   a grab bag of things that you can use in any context,
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.540]   or I should say that you can look to,
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.640]   depending on the context you're in,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.320]   and create the states of body and mind that you want.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.360]   Now, once again, painting with a somewhat broad brush,
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.760]   but nonetheless, an accurate brush,
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.760]   we can say that dopamine, when elevated above baseline,
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:25.080]   tends to increase states of motivation,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.080]   both mental and physical motivation,
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.820]   drive, and to some extent, focus.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:34.160]   I've said it many times before, and I'll say it again,
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.840]   there's a lot of misconception about dopamine.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.000]   Many people out there think that dopamine
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.280]   is all about pleasure.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.440]   You hear about dopamine hits or people chasing dopamine
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.520]   or the need to have a dopamine fast, et cetera.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.860]   Dopamine is not about pleasure.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:52.860]   Dopamine is about motivation, craving, and pursuit for goals
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.940]   or for things that are outside our immediate possession
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.340]   and experience.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.900]   The motivation and pursuit of a mate,
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.320]   the motivation and pursuit to mate,
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.160]   the motivation and pursuit of food,
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.520]   the motivation and pursuit of a career goal,
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.920]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.780]   Things we do not yet have, but that we want,
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.960]   and we get into sort of a forward center of mass
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.080]   and a pursuit of, and that pursuit can be physical,
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.560]   that pursuit can be cognitive,
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.460]   it can be both cognitive and physical,
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.200]   and it can involve talking about something, right?
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.280]   Because in some professions,
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.800]   pursuit of things involves talking.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.760]   I think about lawyers, they talk a lot
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.260]   in pursuit of winning cases and money, et cetera,
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.280]   putting people in jail or keeping people out of jail,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.780]   et cetera, that's done with their mouths,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.160]   not with their bodies.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.940]   Athletes in a state of motivated training
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.500]   or in motivated competition use their bodies,
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.440]   which all this is obvious, of course,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.600]   but perhaps what is not so obvious is that one molecule,
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.440]   not working alone, but predominantly one molecule, dopamine,
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.940]   is responsible for all of those motivated states,
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.760]   which again underscores the power of these neuromodulators.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.640]   So dopamine, we can think of,
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.360]   at least in the context of today's discussion,
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.160]   as controlling and indeed promoting motivation, drive,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.940]   and pursuit, and to some extent, focus.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:15.000]   Epinephrine and a closely related molecule
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.880]   called norepinephrine, and again,
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.820]   I want to emphasize that epinephrine is adrenaline
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.920]   and adrenaline is epinephrine.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.080]   Norepinephrine is noradrenaline
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.080]   and noradrenaline is norepinephrine,
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.560]   but today we're going to just simply talk about epinephrine
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.660]   and norepinephrine.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.000]   That category of neuromodulator is mainly responsible
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   for generating our energy, our level of fuel
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.160]   and baseline level of forward center of mass,
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.320]   as I like to call it.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.400]   You can also think of it as how high your RPM are.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.160]   Now we're not a car and the car analogy sort of falls apart
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.480]   as we go further into the biology,
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.400]   but it's a decent one for now.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.360]   When epinephrine levels are high, we tend to feel agitated,
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.820]   we tend to feel like we want to move,
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.560]   we tend to feel like we can't shut down our thinking
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.080]   and our anticipation of what's going to happen next.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.600]   And when epinephrine levels are very, very low,
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.620]   we actually have less physical energy,
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:13.960]   we tend to have less mental energy
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.800]   in terms of generating thoughts very quickly
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.840]   and so on and so forth.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.760]   And as I mentioned before, dopamine and epinephrine
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.200]   are closely related, so much so that we know for a fact
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.680]   that epinephrine is actually manufactured
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.320]   from the molecule dopamine.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.200]   So that's why I'm talking about these two neuromodulators
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.840]   in very close juxtaposition,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.760]   because they do indeed collaborate with one another.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.000]   But for sake of today's discussion,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.180]   we can just think of epinephrine as increasing energy.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:44.320]   Adrenaline increases energy and our state of readiness.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.060]   It also, I should mention, activates our immune system.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.800]   Contrary to popular belief
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.000]   that stress inhibits our immune system,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.280]   epinephrine is deployed, it's released at great levels
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.160]   in our brain and body when we are stressed,
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.400]   and that actually protects us against infections
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.280]   of multiple kinds, at least in the short term.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.240]   That and all the details of that and tools related to that
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.520]   were covered in our episode on the immune system,
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.240]   if you want to check that out.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.960]   Now, the neuromodulator serotonin
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.800]   creates a number of different states in the brain and body,
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.940]   but for sake of today's discussion,
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.440]   we're going to think about the predominant states
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.360]   that it creates, and those are states of contentedness,
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.400]   being happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed,
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.820]   and to some extent, even some relief from pain
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.240]   or lack of pain.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.200]   Serotonin is associated with a feeling of satiety,
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.640]   of having enough of what we already have.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.720]   Now, when serotonin is very, very high,
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.760]   people can even be sedate.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.620]   They can be completely amotivated,
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:55.160]   no motivation to seek out things like food or sex or work
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.280]   or et cetera, whereas when serotonin levels are very low,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.440]   people can actually exhibit agitation
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   and high levels of stress.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.200]   So the levels matter here, but again,
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.880]   for sake of today's conversation,
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.200]   when we leverage serotonin,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.760]   where you are really leveraging a neuromodulator
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.520]   that tends to increase the activity of neural circuits
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.220]   in the brain and body that make us feel relaxed and happy,
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:23.080]   and it tends to decrease the activity of neural circuits
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.240]   that make us rabidly in pursuit of things
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.160]   that we don't have, right?
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:32.160]   The opposite of content and sated is motivation, desire,
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.020]   and hunger and thirst for things that we don't have.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:39.000]   So serotonin is the molecule of peace.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.900]   It is the molecule of contentness.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.740]   It is the molecule of having enough,
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.560]   at least for the time being,
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.040]   or the feeling that we have enough for the time being.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:51.160]   Now, acetylcholine is a fourth category of neuromodulator
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.920]   that, as I mentioned earlier, is somewhat,
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.020]   not totally, but somewhat distinct from any direct control
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.180]   by the major hormone systems of the body,
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.200]   or at least the major steroid hormone systems.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.320]   And acetylcholine, we can say,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   is mainly associated with states of focus.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.160]   And we can go a step further
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.120]   and say that it's mainly associated with steps of focus
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.240]   as they relate to learning and encoding new information,
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.580]   so-called neuroplasticity.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.720]   Now, neuroplasticity, or the brain and nervous system's
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.520]   ability to change in response to experience,
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.440]   can be impacted by an enormous number of different chemicals,
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.180]   not just acetylcholine.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:32.500]   But acetylcholine has a particularly potent ability
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.560]   to open up the thing that we call neuroplasticity
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.860]   to allow plasticity to happen in one moment,
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.700]   whereas in a previous moment, it could not occur
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.600]   because acetylcholine had not been released in the brain
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.800]   or in the spinal cord.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:51.380]   So acetylcholine is involved in focus and in learning.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:55.100]   But it is not necessarily always associated
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.560]   with learning in the context of highly motivated,
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.400]   really ramped up states.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.760]   It can be, but acetylcholine can also be released
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.480]   and can encourage the learning
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.500]   and neuroplasticity associated with calm states.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:14.000]   For instance, if somebody has a newborn child,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.460]   we know that they are flooded with oxytocin,
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.480]   which has actually even been called the love hormone,
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.680]   although it does many things in addition to control feelings
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.520]   of romantic attachment and attachment to children, et cetera.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.120]   It does all of that, but it does a lot more as well.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.640]   But when people have a new child,
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.960]   they also tend to be hyper-focused on that child,
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.420]   not just its wellbeing, but they narrow all their thinking,
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.600]   all their vision, all their hearing to that child
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.440]   and their obvious adaptive reasons for wanting to do that.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.600]   I recall a family dinner we had,
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.500]   gosh, this was over 10 years ago,
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.600]   we had a couple over, they were,
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.860]   my mom was in the habit of inviting people over
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.720]   who didn't have places to go on the holidays,
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.920]   'cause that's just who she is,
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.760]   and I think it's quite nice.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.180]   So she brought over this couple, they had a newborn,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.080]   I think this baby had been born
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.400]   maybe two or three weeks before,
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.700]   and it was seated, not seated, it was lying down,
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.080]   it couldn't see, it was like a potato bug,
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.280]   it barely holds head up,
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.260]   but it was lying in a little bassinet on the floor
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.400]   as we ate dinner, and it was almost hilarious,
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.580]   it actually was hilarious, we laughed a lot about this,
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.220]   that the entire meal,
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.480]   they were basically staring at this baby,
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.000]   they were so clearly in love with the baby
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.800]   and so flooded with oxytocin and also prolactin,
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.320]   that they couldn't take their focus off this baby,
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.040]   it was actually really wonderful and endearing to see,
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.320]   but in addition to that, I'd be willing to bet,
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.600]   had I been able to do a little bit of micro dialysis,
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.640]   which is the ability to measure the amounts
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.760]   of neuromodulator at a given location in the brain,
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.020]   had I been able to do that experiment on them,
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.340]   in that moment, I would have found
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.880]   that levels of acetylcholine were exceedingly high
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.140]   because they were so hyper-focused on this child,
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.260]   not just in love with, but focused on that child,
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.180]   and without a doubt, the neural circuits
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.220]   related to focus and plasticity were heavily engaged,
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.340]   again, for obvious adaptive reasons
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.420]   related to child rearing and learning the coos and cries
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.540]   and pain signals and pleasure signals of one's offspring.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.220]   So we have dopamine associated with motivation,
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.280]   drive, and pursuit, and to some extent, focus.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.480]   We have epinephrine and norepinephrine associated
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.140]   with energy of having a forward center of mass,
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.920]   mentally and/or physically.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.840]   We have serotonin, which is associated
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.500]   with a peaceful, content, sated state of being.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:38.940]   And we have acetylcholine, which is associated with focus,
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.540]   and in particular, focus as it relates
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.480]   to learning and encoding new information.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.160]   So let's say you want to be more motivated.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.780]   You want to be more in pursuit of goals,
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.760]   and you want to have more energy and to be more focused.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.360]   There are many ways to go about that.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.040]   In fact, there's a near infinite cloud of opportunities,
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.080]   everything from prescription drugs to illicit drugs,
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.940]   which I certainly do not recommend, supplements, nutrition.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.760]   You can listen to particular music.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.600]   You can do all sorts of cognitive, behavioral,
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.680]   nutritional supplementation tricks,
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.320]   or you can just understand that what you're really after
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.720]   are increases in dopamine above baseline that you control.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.800]   And there are ways to control them that are quite potent.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.160]   And science tells us which tools are going to be
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.780]   the most potent and the most versatile for you.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.740]   So I'm going to share those tools with you now
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.240]   with the caveat that each one of those tools
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.680]   could be its own entire podcast episode,
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.120]   and that we've done near entire episodes on each
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.240]   of these tools or small collections of these tools.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.920]   So I'm going to cover these in somewhat superficial manner.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.120]   We can provide links to previous episodes
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.440]   that relate to each of these tools in detail,
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.760]   but I'll give you enough detail about them
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.120]   that would allow you to incorporate them
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.160]   into your routine should you choose.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.600]   Let's say you want to increase dopamine
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.460]   for sake of increasing motivation.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.200]   The first thing to do is to understand
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   what the natural behavioral tools are for increasing dopamine
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.140]   and to do those as consistently as possible.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.120]   Again, these are tools that you'll want to do
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.480]   nearly every day, if not every day.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.400]   And I know I'm sounding like a broken record on this one,
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.980]   but here again, we come to sunlight,
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:25.060]   and I should say not just the desire to,
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.520]   but really the need for viewing the maximum amount
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.680]   of sunlight that one can reasonably get given schedules
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.080]   and locations in the world, time of year, et cetera,
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.520]   in the early part of the day.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.660]   Within the first hour of waking, ideally,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.040]   but certainly in the first three hours of your day,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.580]   you're going to want to maximize sunlight exposure
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.420]   to your eyes.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.440]   Never look at the sun or any other light so bright
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.520]   that it's painful to look at.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.280]   And yes, of course, blinking is fine, but no,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.940]   take sunglasses off, go outside once the sun is out
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.560]   and get some natural light in your eyes.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.060]   And if it's appropriate, or I should say in a way
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.880]   that's appropriate, maximize the amount of sunlight exposure
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.720]   to your skin, but please don't get burned.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.800]   Please do wear sunscreen if you're prone to getting burned.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.360]   Typically, early day sunlight is not going to burn you,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.720]   at least not most people,
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.040]   unless you're extremely fair-skinned.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:14.880]   So don't get burned.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.320]   Do what you need to in order to protect yourself from burn.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.120]   There's some emerging controversy about sunscreen
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.780]   and which ones are safe and which ones aren't safe.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.460]   We have not done an episode on that yet,
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.320]   but I find it to be an important and interesting topic.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.760]   Daria Rose, Dr. Daria Rose, I should say,
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.200]   has a podcast called the Daria Rose Podcast
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.120]   and did an episode all about sunscreens which are safe,
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.780]   which are not safe by interviewing an expert on that.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.240]   So I refer you to that podcast as it relates to sunscreen,
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.080]   but get some natural light exposure in your eyes.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.480]   And if you wake up before the sun comes out,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.080]   turn on as many bright lights inside
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.560]   as you can turn on reasonably,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.920]   given your electric bill, et cetera.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.620]   Get a lot of bright sunlight exposure early in the day
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.360]   and get a lot of sunlight exposure to your skin
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.280]   in the early part of the day in a way that doesn't burn you,
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.880]   meaning burn your skin or blind you.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.640]   Please, please don't do anything that harms your vision,
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.840]   like stare into bright light that's painful.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   What does that do?
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.600]   Well, it sets in motion
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.440]   a number of different biological cascades.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.920]   Some are very fast.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.060]   There are fast actions of sunlight that will trigger,
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.800]   for instance, dopamine release
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.040]   from different parts of your brain
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.660]   and your endocrine system.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.760]   And we now know that it increases levels
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.200]   of genes related to thyroid hormone
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.700]   and actually increases certain dopamine receptors.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.760]   So there's a wonderful paper.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.680]   We will provide a link to this paper
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.760]   that shows that sunlight exposure can actually increase
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.960]   the amount of so-called DRD4.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.840]   This is a particular type of dopamine receptor,
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.020]   the dopamine receptor 4.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.640]   The genes for dopamine receptor 4
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.480]   are actually under photic control.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.280]   So if you get sunlight exposure to your eyes,
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.580]   and it does have to be to your eyes
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.760]   in the early part of the day,
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.400]   you increase the amount of dopamine receptor that you have,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.000]   which allows whatever circulating dopamine happens
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.280]   to be there to have a greater effect on motivation
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.480]   and I should say also on mood and feelings
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.560]   of being in pursuit and generally in craving
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.240]   and pursuit of things in life.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.520]   Now there's another way to increase the effect
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.720]   of whatever dopamine happens to be circulating
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.360]   in your brain and body.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.520]   And this again relates to increasing the number
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.360]   or the efficacy of the receptors for dopamine.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.040]   Now here we're not talking about the dopamine receptor 4,
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.240]   but a different category of dopamine receptors,
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.220]   the D2 and D3 receptors,
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:28.120]   which are expressed multiple places in your brain and body
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.540]   and bind dopamine,
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.000]   meaning dopamine parks in them like a parking spot
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.440]   and allows dopamine to generally increase the activity
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.880]   of the neurons and cells
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   that express those dopamine receptors.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.060]   How do you do that?
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.240]   Well, it turns out that regular ingestion of caffeine
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.040]   at safe and appropriate levels of about 100 to 250 milligrams
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.640]   is going to increase the number
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.040]   of D2 and D3 dopamine receptors.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.000]   I talked a little bit about this on a previous episode.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.940]   Again, we'll provide links to these studies,
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.640]   but this is an important finding, I believe,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.240]   because this is not about the acute,
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.420]   the immediate effects of caffeine on alertness,
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:06.800]   although those occur too.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.160]   When you drink caffeine,
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.960]   it's going to increase your levels of adrenaline
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.320]   and so-called epinephrine,
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.680]   which will increase your energy levels.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.480]   It's going to decrease levels of something called adenosine,
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.820]   which builds up while you're sleepy.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.160]   It's going to make you feel less sleepy,
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.800]   more alert, more energetic.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.180]   That's sort of obvious.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.760]   But what's less obvious is that it's increasing the number
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.800]   and efficacy of dopamine receptors
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.440]   so that whatever dopamine happens to be around in your system
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.760]   is going to have more of a potent effect.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.440]   So how much caffeine should you drink?
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.920]   That's going to vary from person to person.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.160]   Some people are very sensitive to caffeine, others are not.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.080]   I tend to be fairly insensitive to caffeine
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.280]   'cause I've been drinking it for a long period of time.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.720]   But after one or two cups of espresso or coffee,
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.900]   I feel like I've had enough.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.600]   I tend to drink my caffeine early in the day,
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.180]   which is what I'm going to recommend that you do,
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.220]   not drinking caffeine past two and certainly not 4 p.m.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.940]   if you're on a typical schedule and you want to be able
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:59.840]   to sleep that night, even if you can fall asleep.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.740]   Having too much caffeine in your system is not good
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.620]   because it disrupts the architecture of sleep.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.700]   And now knowing about all the metabolic variability
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.380]   across the night, according to different stages of sleep,
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.660]   it should be even more obvious as to why disrupting
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.620]   the architecture of sleep will be bad for you.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.660]   So limit that caffeine intake to early in the day
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.680]   and don't go ballistic if you're not,
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.120]   certainly don't go ballistic in any case.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.140]   But for most people, anywhere from 100 to 400 milligrams
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.860]   of caffeine is going to have this effect.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.200]   And this effect, again, is a slow accumulating effect
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.100]   by drinking caffeine consistently day to day.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.660]   I get my caffeine mainly from Yerba Mate tea.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.140]   I want to emphasize that it's probably a good idea
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.880]   to stay away from the smoked Mates.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.980]   There's some evidence those can be carcinogenic,
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.140]   but I brew my own Yerba Mate tea,
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.060]   or sometimes I'll drink coffee or espresso
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:44.280]   or sometimes both, frankly.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.380]   As long as I'm hydrating enough and I'm getting enough salt,
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.820]   then I tend to feel fine with that much caffeine.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.340]   The other way to increase dopamine and to make sure
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.360]   that your baseline levels of dopamine are high enough
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.140]   is to make sure that you're eating sufficient numbers
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.820]   of tyrosine-rich foods.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.360]   You can look up which foods include tyrosine.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.620]   Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.760]   It's an amino acid that is a direct pathway
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.380]   to dopamine synthesis.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.660]   And tyrosine foods include things like certain meats,
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.800]   Parmesan cheese, very high in tyrosine, for instance.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.760]   In fact, there's something called the cheese effect,
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.600]   believe it or not.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.780]   I don't want to go too far off topic,
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.320]   but the cheese effect is kind of interesting
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.980]   because certain people will take antidepressants
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.600]   that are so-called MAO inhibitors,
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.000]   monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.020]   Anytime you hear ASE, that's an enzyme,
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.500]   they will take these inhibitors that prevent the breakdown
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.300]   of dopamine and other so-called catecholamines,
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.840]   which allow more dopamine to be in circulation.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.440]   But if these people eat certain cheeses,
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.040]   including Parmesan cheese, and there are other foods,
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.140]   of course, that include not just tyrosine,
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:51.700]   but one of the derivatives of tyrosine, called terramine,
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.620]   that generates what's called the cheese effect,
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.100]   which is people get potent migraines, headaches,
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.780]   blood pressure goes up, why?
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.200]   Well, because they've got a lot of tyrosine in their system
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.560]   and dopamine in their system,
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.680]   and they've got less of the enzyme that removes that dopamine
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.780]   or limits its action, and so they have an excess of dopamine
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.980]   and dopamine has effects on blood pressure, et cetera.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.740]   So the cheese effect is something to avoid.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:18.300]   If you are somebody who's taking drugs that tap into
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.140]   or manipulate the dopamine pathway,
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.720]   either for Parkinson's or depressions,
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.000]   obviously you're going to want to be careful
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.780]   about adjusting up or down levels of dopamine too potently.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.260]   So mind the cheese effect if you're taking an MAO inhibitor.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.020]   There's a lot of information about this online.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.780]   For most people, eating foods like Parmesan cheese,
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.500]   eating foods like certain meats and certain vegetables
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.420]   also can increase tyrosine levels,
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.780]   which will increase dopamine synthesis.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.580]   So these are ways of modulating
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.620]   more or less the baseline of dopamine
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.900]   that you are able to produce
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.820]   and the ways that dopamine can have its action
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.720]   by way of binding to receptors more potently.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.260]   Now, there are other ways to increase dopamine
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.500]   in a more acute or directed way,
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.740]   ways to spike your dopamine
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:07.740]   to enhance your state of motivation, mood, focus, and so on.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:11.700]   And in thinking about the vast landscape of tools
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.400]   that can do that, we have one category of tools,
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.820]   which are the really, really bad things
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.200]   that I don't recommend anybody do.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.560]   In fact, I recommend nobody do ever,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.840]   which are things like cocaine, methamphetamine, et cetera.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.820]   They are incredibly destructive for lives
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.480]   because of the way that they so potently increase dopamine
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.940]   and then the crash in dopamine that occurs later.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.480]   I mean, they can indeed and often do ruin lives,
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.680]   so we're leaving those off the table.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.900]   There are, of course, prescription drugs
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.180]   that many people, especially people
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:43.220]   who have clinically diagnosed ADHD,
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.180]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.460]   rely on and in fact benefit from in many cases,
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:52.040]   things like Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.900]   Nowadays, there's also a lot of interest
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.760]   in use of things like modafinil, R-modafinil.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.620]   I covered all of those in the episode on ADHD,
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.380]   and you can find that at hubermanlab.com
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.480]   and the other places this podcast is found.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.760]   Prescription drugs aside,
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.140]   because they require a prescription and a discussion
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.800]   that's in-depth and appropriate with your physician,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.260]   healthcare provider, there are supplements
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.120]   that can very potently increase dopamine as well,
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.300]   perhaps not to the extent
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.820]   that some of those other prescription drugs can,
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.920]   but certainly to a degree that will impact
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.940]   and increase dopamine and motivation
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.760]   and the other states dopamine is associated with.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.680]   And the two main categories of supplements
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.780]   that are very effective in raising dopamine,
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.300]   and here I should provide the caveat
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.180]   that anytime you're going to add or remove anything
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.000]   from your supplementation protocols,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.420]   please talk to a physician who is knowledgeable
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.320]   on these topics.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.280]   If you're somebody who has,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.320]   or is taking drugs for depression or mania,
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.440]   please be very cautious
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.000]   about manipulating your dopamine in any case.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.400]   I don't just say that to protect us,
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.780]   I say that to protect you.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:56.140]   But if we were to look at the supplement landscape
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.080]   and ask which supplements increase dopamine,
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.240]   there are a vast number of them,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.720]   but the three main ones,
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.160]   the most effective ones that are readily available out there
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.640]   without a prescription are macuna prurines.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.280]   This is actually the outside of a velvety bean
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.920]   that has been extracted and put into a supplement.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.480]   Macuna prurines is actual L-DOPA.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.960]   It's 99% L-DOPA, which is a prescription drug
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.180]   that is given for Parkinson's and for other purposes
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.680]   where increasing dopamine is important.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.680]   I don't recommend macuna prurines.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.220]   I'm not saying that no one should take it,
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.340]   but I don't take it and I don't recommend it
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.740]   because it tends to so potently
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.200]   and acutely increase dopamine
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.000]   that there's a pretty substantial crash afterwards.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.640]   So I avoid it and I don't generally suggest
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.400]   that anyone take it unless there's really a clinical need
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.240]   or they're working very closely with somebody
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.440]   that can really monitor that.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.040]   The other two supplements that can increase dopamine
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.040]   in a short-term way but in a significant way are L-tyrosine.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.680]   So you can buy that as a supplement amino acid.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.720]   I sometimes take this.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.340]   I would say I probably take it about once a week maximum
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.120]   for workouts or workouts.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.920]   I'll take it in dosages of anywhere
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.200]   from 500 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.720]   People vary tremendously in their sensitivity
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.200]   to supplementing L-tyrosine.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   I know people that can take two grams.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.080]   I know people that can barely take 100 milligrams.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.820]   I know people that the best dose for them is zero milligrams.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.360]   So there's a lot of variation there depending on sensitivity
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.560]   and their natural baseline levels of dopamine
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.040]   and whether or not they're doing a lot of other things
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.800]   to support dopamine.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.280]   But nonetheless, taking L-tyrosine
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.560]   will lead to fairly substantial increases in dopamine
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.640]   within about 15 to 45 minutes.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.900]   And it lasts for about 30 minutes to two hours.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.680]   And then there's kind of a tapering off.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.820]   Some people experience a little bit of an emotional
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.480]   or, and or I should say energetic crash.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.320]   Some people don't.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.360]   And then the other supplement that I certainly use
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.760]   and that I know a number of other people use
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.320]   is more fast acting but more potent,
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.160]   which is phenylethylamine.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.160]   This relates to the so-called PEA molecule, P, P-E-A.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.640]   And phenylethylamine increases dopamine
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.640]   and some metabolites related to dopamine
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.360]   in ways that really increase energy
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.040]   and feelings of wellbeing and motivation.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.700]   And again, it's fast acting.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.720]   So my particular protocol, the one I use,
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.160]   is I'll take phenylethylamine
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.800]   at dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.580]   along with some L-tyrosine.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.640]   Or I'll take it on its own with a molecule,
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   or I should say a compound
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.720]   that we'll talk about a little bit later
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.280]   as it relates to acetylcholine alpha-GPC.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.240]   But tyrosine and phenylethylamine taken alone or together
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.840]   will make you feel more motivated and more alert,
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.120]   more willing and able to lean
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.240]   into particular motivated behaviors,
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.400]   whether or not they're physical or cognitive.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.760]   If you'd like to learn more about these compounds
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.840]   and their supplementation and their effects,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.000]   I encourage you to check out the ever valuable website,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.240]   examine.com.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.120]   It's zero cost to access and they provide references
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.040]   and some more details about these sorts of compounds
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.720]   and other related compounds.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.820]   Now, if we were going to look at behavioral tools
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.080]   for potently increasing dopamine,
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.400]   that too is a vast landscape.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.660]   And we know based on hundreds, if not thousands of studies,
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.600]   that things like winning at some sort of competition
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.800]   or succeeding in reaching a goal
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.360]   can certainly increase dopamine.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.000]   We talk a lot about this in the episode
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.480]   on dopamine motivation and drive.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.200]   But leaving that aside,
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.400]   there are certain behavioral protocols
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.400]   that are unrelated to your overall goals and motivations
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.160]   that can increase dopamine in a very sustained way.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.740]   And without question,
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:36.340]   the most potent behavioral tool for doing that
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.520]   is going to be deliberate cold exposure.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.180]   Deliberate cold exposure has been talked about a lot here
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:47.660]   and elsewhere in terms of its ability to do things
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:51.240]   like reduce inflammation as a way to test
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.800]   and improve resilience because uncomfortable cold
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.520]   provided it's applied safely
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.680]   is a great way to learn to be more resilient
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.320]   because you're essentially staying
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.400]   or forcing yourself to stay in a circumstance
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.980]   where your system is flooded with adrenaline.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.980]   But one lesser known aspect of deliberate cold exposure
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.040]   is one that's been demonstrated quite convincingly in humans.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   It comes from a study published in the year 2000.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.080]   I'll link to this study.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.560]   I love this study, by the way.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.120]   I covered it many times on this podcast
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.400]   because I love it so much and I think it's truly important.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.440]   And that's the study from Sramak et al.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.820]   entitled Human Physiological Responses to Immersion
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.400]   into Water of Different Temperatures.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.200]   I'm not going to go into this into a ton of detail
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.400]   for sake of time,
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.500]   but basically what they show is that
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.680]   putting people into cold water,
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.160]   and I should mention the water that they used in this study
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.160]   wasn't that cold.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.360]   They had a bunch of different conditions,
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.480]   but they had people that got into, for instance,
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.440]   60 degree Fahrenheit water for up to two hours.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.800]   I had them sitting there
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.440]   in a lawn chair up to their neck,
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.400]   had very long sustained increases in dopamine transmission
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.920]   and dopamine circulation in their brain and body.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.800]   And also some of the other catecholamines.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.840]   As I mentioned before, dopamine tends to collaborate
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.220]   with epinephrine and vice versa.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.080]   Now you don't need to put yourself
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.900]   into 60 degree Fahrenheit water
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.080]   to get these kinds of sustained increases.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.640]   And you certainly don't need to do it for two hours.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.120]   We have strong reason to believe
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.760]   based on subsequent studies,
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.760]   in fact, published just this last year,
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   that getting into much colder water
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   of say 50 degrees or 55 degrees
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.400]   or even 45 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.560]   can potently increase dopamine and epinephrine as well.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.120]   And that you don't need to expose yourself
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.560]   to that cold water for nearly as long.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.480]   So perhaps even as short as one minute
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.640]   or even 30 seconds exposure to really cold water
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.480]   can lead to these potent long lasting increases in dopamine.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.980]   Many people will ask which protocols to follow.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:49.320]   For instance, will a cold shower suffice?
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.560]   Very likely yes, if your shower gets cold enough.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.440]   Do you need ice floating in the bath?
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.260]   No, it's all about the temperature and not
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.120]   whether or not there's ice present or not.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.300]   How long to stay in there?
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.660]   There are a lot of details
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.520]   that we don't have time to go into this episode.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.040]   Please see the episode on the use of deliberate cold
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.320]   for health and performance.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.060]   You'll find that at Hubermanlab.com.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.640]   We have a newsletter related to this.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.820]   It gets into a lot of detailed protocols.
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.400]   But in general, we can say
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.580]   that the way to evoke dopamine and epinephrine release
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.000]   using cold water is to,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   ideally you would do cold water immersion.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.100]   If you can't, you'd use cold shower.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.840]   But you want to use a temperature that is safe,
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.480]   meaning you're not going to have a heart attack,
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.660]   but that is uncomfortable,
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.140]   such that you really want to get out
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.940]   and then staying in for anywhere from one minute
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.580]   to 10 minutes depending on how cold adapted you are.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.940]   And then getting out and drying off
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.780]   and going about your day
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.980]   unless you have some other protocol
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.780]   that you're trying to extract from the cold.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.140]   So this is a cold exposure protocol
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:48.520]   specifically aimed at increasing dopamine.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.440]   For some people out there, you might think,
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.360]   this is kind of silly using cold water to increase dopamine.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.100]   But when you look at the data in humans
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.040]   on the effect of cold water exposure
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.780]   to stimulate long lasting,
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.840]   very significant increases in dopamine and epinephrine,
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.280]   I think you'll agree that this is a really potent tool
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.820]   that provided it's given safely and gone about safely
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.060]   is giving you the kinds of increases in dopamine
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.900]   that you would seek using prescription pharmacology.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.720]   Now it shouldn't be used as a replacement
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.500]   for prescription pharmacology,
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.740]   although people have done that to success.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.620]   One of the previous guests on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:24.740]   was Dr. Anna Lemke,
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.820]   our director of the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.660]   at Stanford.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.660]   She has an amazing book called "Dopamine Nation,"
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:32.380]   all about dopamine and both its uses,
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   healthy and its perils in things like addiction.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:38.020]   And she describes a patient of hers
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.740]   that used deliberate cold exposure
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.660]   to try and maintain dopamine levels
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.300]   while coming off of drugs
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.940]   that were increasing dopamine so potently
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.060]   that they were putting him down the path of addiction.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.580]   So the use of cold water for increasing dopamine
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.820]   is a real tool.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.860]   It's, I would say, a power tool.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.380]   In fact, it's the kind of thing
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.860]   that if you want to increase dopamine
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.660]   for sake of motivation,
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.180]   it might be your first go-to,
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.680]   provided you're also doing the things
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.380]   to maintain dopamine baseline,
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.460]   like sunlight exposure in particular,
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:08.880]   making sure you're getting sufficient amounts of tyrosine
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.580]   containing foods and so on.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:11.740]   And now just very briefly,
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.060]   I want to point to a few quick tools
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:19.060]   that good peer-reviewed data tell us can be leveraged
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.620]   in order to make sure that you have sufficient dopamine
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.540]   when you want it,
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.900]   or that it's available for it to be released
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.900]   by any number of the tools I provided thus far.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:31.240]   And those are sufficient number of B vitamins.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.100]   So it turns out that B vitamins,
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.120]   in particular B6 or vitamin B6,
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.020]   can potently reduce prolactin levels.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.360]   And again, prolactin and dopamine tend to work
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.040]   in kind of push-pull fashion.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.960]   That said, you should be cautious
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.900]   about taking excessive levels of B6.
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.940]   It is a vitamin that if you take too much,
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.780]   you'll likely excrete it through your urine,
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.180]   but there is evidence
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.860]   that having excessively high levels of B6
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.420]   or supplementing with excessively high levels of B6
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.300]   can cause some peripheral neuropathy,
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.580]   some death of nerves in the periphery.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.540]   If you want to know what dosage levels are relevant there,
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.680]   just simply look it up online.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.220]   There's a lot of information about this,
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.420]   but you do want to make sure that you're getting enough
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.340]   B6, B12, et cetera,
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.420]   such that you can keep prolactin levels in check.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.880]   And if you suspect that you have a dopamine deficiency,
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.460]   please talk to your doctor and talk to them
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:23.020]   about ways you might adjust that prolactin down
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.180]   and thereby dopamine up.
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.700]   The other way to ensure that dopamine levels stay high
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.500]   or put differently that you don't quash
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.760]   whatever dopamine you have in your system
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.620]   is to really avoid bright light exposure to your eyes
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.780]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.020]   Or another way of putting this,
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.500]   because I realize people sleep at different times, et cetera,
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.060]   is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes,
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.660]   not just blue light, but all colors of light,
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:52.620]   in phase three, that is 17 to 24 hours after waking up
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.420]   because that's really when you should be asleep
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:57.640]   or trying to get asleep if you're having trouble sleeping.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.360]   Work from Samir Hatar's lab,
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.860]   the director of the Chronobiology Unit
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:02.960]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.980]   again, a previous Huberman Lab podcast guest,
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.520]   tell us that bright light exposure in phase three
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.520]   of your circadian cycle, 17 to 24 hours after waking,
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.480]   can have dramatic effects in reducing dopamine levels
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.360]   by way of activating a neural circuit
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.280]   involving something called the habenula.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.260]   Want to get into too many details right now,
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.060]   but really try and keep the lights dim
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.120]   in the middle of the night or off if you can do that safely.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.440]   It's really going to help
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.800]   if you're turning on your phone brightly,
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.720]   if you're turning on bright lights,
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.320]   it's not just going to negatively impact melatonin,
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.040]   the hormone that helps you fall and stay asleep,
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.160]   it's also going to negatively impact dopamine levels,
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.400]   not just that night, but the subsequent day.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.000]   So that more or less summarizes our coverage
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.640]   of ways to use behavior and supplementation and nutrition
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.440]   to increase dopamine and dopamine receptor efficacy
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.560]   and number and to keep sufficient amounts of dopamine
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:02.800]   in your system day to day for motivation, mood, and focus.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.440]   And of course, keep in mind those things
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.920]   that can suppress dopamine, the bright light exposure,
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.080]   elevated prolactin, and so on.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.940]   My hope is that by understanding those tools
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:13.640]   and how they work and understanding
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.520]   that dopamine does certain things and not others,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.300]   that you can assemble a versatile kit of behaviors
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.680]   and other things that you can do
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.800]   in order to adjust your dopamine levels
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.380]   according to your particular goals.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.860]   I want to just briefly return to the fact, however,
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:33.180]   that all of that is riding on that phase one,
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:34.540]   phase two background,
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.300]   meaning it's probably going to take less cold water exposure,
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.100]   or I should say less time doing cold water exposure
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.860]   early in the day to get a big increase in dopamine
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.580]   than it would later in the day,
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.500]   because later in the day,
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.900]   your baseline levels of dopamine are lower
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.620]   and you've got more serotonin circulating.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.460]   That should make sense to you now as to why that's the case.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.940]   And does that mean that you should really modify
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.420]   your protocols dramatically?
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.220]   Probably not, but you might keep that in mind
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.280]   that if, for instance,
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.380]   you need to be in a highly motivated focused state
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.520]   in the late part of the day for whatever reason,
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.040]   it might take a few or more of these tools in combination
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.460]   in order to accomplish that.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.300]   Whereas if you're somebody
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.420]   who feels pretty good during the day,
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.100]   but you're kind of lacking motivation
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:16.500]   and you want to increase dopamine levels
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.240]   and you don't yet need to
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.940]   or want to resort to prescription drugs or supplementation,
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.900]   well, then you might layer in
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:23.260]   a couple of behavioral protocols,
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.700]   paying attention to, of course,
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:25.760]   the things that you might be doing
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.580]   that would also potentially suppress dopamine.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.780]   So again, that kit of tools is designed for you to play with
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.640]   if you choose, if it's safe for you to apply them,
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.000]   then do that.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.780]   Consider doing them individually,
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:42.220]   not trying to hit all the tools all at once, right?
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.380]   I mean, why throw all those tools
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   at your dopamine system at once?
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.680]   Better would be to have those tools in your kit
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.860]   and be able to deploy them
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.420]   depending on whether or not you're on travel,
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.880]   whether or not you're eating well or less well,
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.060]   whether or not you're sleeping well or less well,
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.300]   that's highly individual.
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.040]   And I like to think that in having those tools in hand,
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.980]   you'll be able to adjust them and apply them
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.140]   in the ways that allow you to access
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.820]   the dopamine increases that you're after.
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.820]   So next I'd like to talk about epinephrine,
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.700]   also called adrenaline.
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.420]   I want to point out that epinephrine is released
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:15.560]   both in the brain and the body.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.680]   In fact, there's a barrier between brain and body
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.140]   that prevents the epinephrine
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.360]   that's released from your adrenal glands,
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.320]   crossing the blood brain barrier.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.120]   So your brain has a separate site called the locus coeruleus.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.240]   This is a collection of neurons in the back of the brain
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.760]   that kind of sprinkler the rest of the brain
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.000]   with epinephrine and essentially wakes up
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.560]   whatever neural circuits happen to see,
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.460]   or I should say wake up any circuits
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.900]   where that epinephrine happens to arrive, right?
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.560]   And generally increase the excitability of those networks.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.020]   That's why we say epinephrine increases energy.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.660]   I'm not talking about caloric energy,
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.700]   although that's distantly related to this,
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.140]   but really energy and the desire to move,
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.840]   the feeling that we can think,
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.500]   the feeling that we can be alert.
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.140]   In fact, if you look at somebody
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.860]   and their eyelids are wide open, in large part,
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.100]   that's because of a lot of adrenaline in their system.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.620]   If their pupils are really big
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:11.060]   and their eyes are really wide open, in general,
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.380]   that means they have a lot of epinephrine circulating there.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:15.460]   Whereas when we're tired and we're kind of hood-eyed
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.240]   and we're sort of sleepy or our pupils are really small,
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.940]   in general, that's because levels of epinephrine
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.340]   and also dopamine, remember they work together,
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.300]   levels of epinephrine and dopamine tend to be lower.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.540]   This is also why when people take any drug,
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.640]   like again, not recommending this amphetamine or cocaine
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.340]   or any stimulant, their pupils tend to be huge,
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.740]   their eyes tend to be wide open,
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.720]   they don't blink very often,
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.260]   and the opposite is true when people take sedatives.
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.660]   So it all starts to make sense
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:46.660]   when you think about the basic actions of these things.
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:51.240]   For many people, increasing adrenaline or epinephrine
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.520]   might seem like a crazy idea.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.280]   Most people probably associate this molecule with stress
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.860]   and they would like to be less stressed.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.740]   And we've done entire episodes about stress,
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.800]   how to master stress, how to leverage stress,
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800]   how to conquer stress, there are a lot of great tools
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.560]   to do that that are behavioral, supplementation-based.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.760]   Please see the episode on mastering stress for those tools.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.840]   But there are people, including me,
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.400]   that want to increase our levels of epinephrine
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.160]   at least early in the day.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.900]   I'm somebody who wakes up rather slowly.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.160]   In fact, right after waking up,
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.060]   I rarely want to bounce out of bed.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.660]   I try and push myself to do that.
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:25.220]   I'm always impressed by these chock-a-willing types
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:29.000]   that are up at 430 or up at five and already into action.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.200]   I tend to be kind of thinking about thinking about
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.680]   maybe being in action early in the day,
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.880]   but I try and push myself to get into action,
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.400]   which itself can increase epinephrine.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.980]   I should mention that any physical activity,
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.220]   any physical activity, walking, running, weightlifting,
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.900]   swimming, even talking for that matter,
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.220]   is going to increase levels of epinephrine.
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:54.180]   Locus coeruleus is a brain structure
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:56.920]   that is tightly coupled with behaviors
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.460]   in a bi-directional way.
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.140]   That is, when you are in action,
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.300]   you increase the amount of epinephrine released
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.340]   from locus coeruleus, you wake up the brain.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:09.680]   And conversely, when locus coeruleus is active,
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.560]   the brain wakes up.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.260]   So it's reciprocal, it goes both directions.
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:16.240]   So I saw a funny tweet actually earlier today.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:20.220]   It was something like going to the gym gives you energy,
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.960]   but you need energy to go to the gym,
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.120]   sounds like a pyramid scheme to me,
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.800]   which made me chuckle, but of course,
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.860]   overlooks the fact that indeed, if you have energy,
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.520]   you are more likely to be willing
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.380]   to get into physical movement or cognitive movement
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.880]   and thinking hard or thinking a lot about something.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.160]   But also it is absolutely scientifically proven
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.200]   that being in action increases levels of epinephrine.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.000]   This is why exercising early in the day
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.660]   gives you more energy for rest of day.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.540]   You still might experience a little bit of a crash
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:54.580]   in the afternoon,
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.820]   especially if you're getting up extra early,
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.120]   or if you're drinking caffeine too close to waking.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.300]   I've talked about this before.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.220]   If you drink too much caffeine close to waking,
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.740]   you're going to have an afternoon crash.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.860]   Better to push that caffeine intake out
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.120]   about 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.300]   I know this is really painful for certain people,
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.140]   but caffeine does increase epinephrine.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.760]   Caffeine does other things to limit sleepiness.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.960]   And by pushing it out 90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.420]   you will avoid the afternoon crash to a large degree.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.820]   And if you get up and you exercise
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.680]   or even do any movement of any kind,
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.820]   100 jumping jacks or a walk if you can't do that,
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:35.700]   anything like that will increase the total amount
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.280]   of epinephrine that you secrete into your bloodstream
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.980]   and in your brain and will get you more energy,
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.760]   not just in that moment, but throughout the day.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.700]   So keep that in mind.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.580]   Exercise does indeed give you energy.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:50.760]   It burns caloric energy, but it gives you neural energy
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.180]   by way of increasing epinephrine transmission
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.680]   from locus coeruleus.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.420]   And presumably if the exercise is intense enough,
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.220]   adrenaline epinephrine release from the adrenals
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.860]   within your body as well.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.960]   So we have exercise and we have caffeine as potent tools
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.100]   for increasing epinephrine and thereby energy.
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.540]   Another potent tool that's purely behavioral,
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:14.820]   but is known to work based on excellent studies in humans.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:17.260]   And actually my laboratory has been doing similar types
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:20.040]   of studies that are soon to be published, we hope,
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.820]   is so-called cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.300]   Some of you may be familiar with Wim Hof breathing.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.140]   There's also Tummo breathing, which is very similar,
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:29.900]   Kundalini breathing.
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.780]   All of those styles of breathing involve cyclic
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:37.100]   hyperventilation, deep inhales and either passive exhales
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.940]   or active exhales, but repeating inhale, exhale, inhale,
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.660]   exhale in a very deep and repetitive way.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.620]   If you were to do that right now,
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.540]   it doesn't matter if you do it through your nose or mouth,
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.860]   although ideally you would do the inhale through your nose
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:49.820]   and the exhale through your mouth.
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:52.900]   If you did that for 25 repetitions,
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:55.980]   25 inhales and exhales, you would feel more alert.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.660]   You'd also feel more warm, why?
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:00.920]   Because you increased epinephrine adrenaline release
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.020]   in the brain and body.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.520]   It works the first time and it works every time
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.380]   to increase epinephrine and thereby energy.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.900]   And in fact, there are protocols and great scientific
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.300]   studies of using cyclic hyperventilation for periods
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.860]   of minutes, if not longer, where for instance,
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.560]   you would do 25 big inhales and exhales,
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.940]   followed by a brief breath hold with your lungs empty,
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.180]   then repeat 25, then brief breath hold, excuse me, exhale,
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:29.100]   hold your lungs empty, and then repeat again
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:30.740]   for a third round if you like.
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:33.200]   If you do that over and over, you're going to be very alert.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.260]   You're going to have more energy.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.060]   You're going to feel like you want to move around
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:36.900]   a lot more.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.260]   In fact, you might even feel agitated.
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:41.220]   So people with a lot of anxiety or prone to panic attack
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.500]   might want to be cautious in how they train
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.220]   and embark on that type of breathing,
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:46.780]   might want to approach it a little more carefully
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.020]   or avoid it altogether.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.100]   But for most people, cyclic hyperventilation
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.660]   is simply going to get you more energized
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:53.660]   and feeling like you want to move,
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:55.380]   feeling like you can think more clearly
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:57.100]   and you will be more wide-eyed and alert
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.820]   because you are releasing adrenaline.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.380]   And the cold water exposure protocol
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:02.380]   that I talked about earlier,
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.540]   and that's covered in our episode on cold
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.620]   and in the newsletter on cold.
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.560]   Well, that, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.900]   potently increases dopamine, but also epinephrine.
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:13.220]   So that's another terrific tool,
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.720]   whether or not it's applied by cold shower or cold immersion
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.060]   or some other thing like cryo,
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.820]   that is going to make you more alert
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:23.060]   because it releases adrenaline.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.500]   Now, we can't really say that there are foods
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.240]   to increase epinephrine.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:30.780]   Rather, there are foods that include a lot of tyrosine
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:32.660]   that will increase dopamine.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.480]   And remember, dopamine is the molecule
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.200]   from which epinephrine is synthesized.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.060]   So we can't really point to a particular food
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.080]   or categories of food for increasing epinephrine.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.480]   I think caffeine and things like it
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.220]   will increase epinephrine.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.220]   There are, of course, prescription drugs
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.220]   that will increase epinephrine.
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:53.540]   And of course, there are all sorts of so-called beta blockers
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.920]   that will block the receptors for epinephrine
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.260]   to make you feel calm for public speaking
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.300]   or for various heart conditions, et cetera.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.240]   That's really the domain of physicians
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.460]   and should really be worked out with your cardiologist,
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:06.860]   with a physician, et cetera.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.680]   I think the tools of exercise
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:13.940]   and should you want very potent increases in adrenaline,
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.860]   high-intensity exercise, as well as the tools of caffeine,
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.780]   cyclic hyperventilation, and deliberate cold exposure
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.580]   really combined to give you a nice little kit.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:28.100]   I would say a versatile kit of ways to increase epinephrine
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:30.780]   for sake of having more physical and mental energy.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:33.540]   So next is the neuromodulator acetylcholine.
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.180]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:38.900]   acetylcholine is associated with states of focus.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:40.140]   And those states of focus
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.460]   can be high-energy states of focus.
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:45.280]   So the ones that are accompanied
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.860]   by high levels of dopamine and epinephrine
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:49.920]   and where we're really excited about
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.940]   and really lasered in on something,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.020]   or they can be the calmer, more relaxed states of focus,
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.820]   like reading a book or practicing music
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:01.120]   or listening very carefully to somebody
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.340]   in a way that's relaxed and calm.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:06.980]   And yet nonetheless, where we have a narrow cognitive
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:10.140]   and typically a narrow visual aperture
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:12.860]   and typically also a narrow auditory aperture,
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.680]   that is our auditory system and our visual system
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.860]   and our thinking can be very broad,
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.560]   it can be all over the place,
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.740]   or it can be very narrow and it can be very focused.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:26.980]   Acetylcholine is released from two major sites in the brain,
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.540]   nucleus basalis, which is in the forebrain
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.500]   and extends connections out to many different brain areas
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:36.660]   to offer the opportunity to release acetylcholine locally
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.140]   and more or less in a chemical way,
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.660]   highlight those particular neurons and synapses
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.660]   for strengthening for plasticity later.
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.940]   And it is released from sites in the back of the brain
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:52.660]   in a way that can increase the so-called fidelity
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:56.020]   of information coming in through our eyes,
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.120]   our ears, our nose, et cetera.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.220]   What do I mean by fidelity?
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:59.920]   Well, we are constantly being bombarded
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.380]   with sensory information through all of our various senses
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.720]   and acetylcholine released from this area
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.100]   in the back of the brain has the ability
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:12.460]   to increase the extent to which say visual information
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:15.280]   or just visual and auditory information
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.320]   would make it through to our consciousness,
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.640]   whereas all the other types of sensory information
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.660]   that are coming in are filtered out.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:25.880]   So your brain, because it's taking in all this information,
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.820]   needs to decide what to pay attention to.
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.740]   And in this way, we can say that acetylcholine
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:32.720]   has a lot to do, not just with focus in air quotes,
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.360]   but literally attention,
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.420]   which neural signals become relevant to our consciousness.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:40.060]   There's a whole discussion to be had there
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.420]   and we don't have time for that.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.800]   Rather, I'd like to focus on what are the tools
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.680]   that one can use to maintain healthy baselines
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.980]   of acetylcholine and increase acetylcholine
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:53.660]   for sake of learning any type of information,
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.540]   physical, cognitive, or otherwise.
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.300]   Now, it turns out there've been a lot of studies,
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.100]   including many quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.620]   carried out in humans looking at what happens
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:05.380]   when you increase acetylcholine levels in the brain
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:07.980]   and you accompany that with the attempt to learn.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.400]   And what you find almost always
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.640]   is that people experience increased focus
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.020]   that when measured,
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:18.220]   the neuronal responses become more specific,
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.260]   so less broad scale activity in the brain
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:23.140]   and more specific neural circuit activity,
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:27.500]   and that this triggers immediate and long-lasting changes
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.900]   in the way those circuits work,
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:31.180]   even when acetylcholine is not being deployed,
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:34.340]   so-called neuroplasticity, the circuits literally change.
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.340]   So this is great.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.740]   The work of Michael Silver at Berkeley,
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:40.360]   the work of Mike Merzenich at UCSF,
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.380]   the work of Michael Kilgard down in Texas,
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.860]   all of those laboratories see this again and again and again.
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:47.500]   Increase acetylcholine before and during learning,
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.480]   and there's a much higher probability
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.500]   that the learning will quote unquote sink in,
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.100]   that the information will be retained
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.380]   because those neural circuits change.
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.060]   Now, ways to increase acetylcholine in a potent way
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:03.440]   include, again, nutrition and supplementation.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.980]   It is important to have baseline levels of acetylcholine
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.620]   be sufficiently high as well.
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:10.620]   And for that, really the ideal situation
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.440]   is to regularly ingest foods
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.420]   that provide enough of the precursors
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:16.380]   for acetylcholine to be made.
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.900]   If you go online and you were to do a search
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.860]   of which foods contain a lot of choline,
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.200]   which is related to the synthesis of acetylcholine,
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.180]   you would get some interesting information back.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.780]   For instance, beef liver is the most potent source of choline.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.600]   I know nowadays there's kind of a growing micro trend,
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.380]   if you will, of ingesting beef liver, even raw liver,
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.940]   which to be honest, the thought of ingesting raw liver
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:42.420]   of any kind activates my area of postrema,
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:44.620]   which is the area of the brain that triggers nausea.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.220]   In fact, I'm starting to salivate a bit,
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.060]   not because I'm hungry,
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:49.960]   but I think the whole concept makes me ill.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.540]   Nonetheless, cooked liver or raw liver for that matter,
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.940]   or liver of any kind seems to contain a lot of choline.
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:59.880]   I realize most people,
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.220]   most people are not going to be running out
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.780]   and ingesting large amounts of beef liver.
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:07.540]   Eggs contain a lot of choline, beef contains choline,
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:08.740]   soybeans contain choline.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.260]   So there are vegan or non-meat sources.
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.860]   Chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans,
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.100]   these sorts of things contain a lot of choline.
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:17.800]   And there are other vegetables that contain choline.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.180]   So depending on your dietary preferences and needs,
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:23.300]   you can select certain foods to ingest
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.740]   to get enough choline to synthesize
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:27.420]   enough baseline acetylcholine.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.900]   In the realm of supplementation,
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:33.980]   there are some excellent tools for increasing acetylcholine
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:35.680]   in the acute short term,
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.780]   meaning over the course of about 30 minutes out
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:40.960]   to about two hours or maybe even four hours.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.040]   And the number of different molecules that can do that,
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.620]   that are available without a prescription,
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.320]   at least in the US, is pretty vast.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.080]   The most common of those molecules is actually nicotine.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.340]   Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are abundant
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.780]   throughout the body and brain.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.780]   They're in various brain circuits.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:59.600]   They are on muscle.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.720]   And yes, smoking nicotine either by vaping or cigarette
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.700]   will activate those nicotinic receptors.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:10.180]   But of course, smoking is a terrible thing.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:12.740]   It will also activate things like lung cancer.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.140]   So I definitely don't recommend that.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:16.980]   It also activates addiction because of the ways
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:20.060]   that it triggers activation of the dopamine circuit.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.100]   So I think that triggering activation
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:25.860]   of acetylcholine related pathways
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.660]   by ingesting nicotine by way of inhalants
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.300]   is generally a bad idea.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:34.740]   However, some people will chew Nicorette
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:37.760]   or other nicotine type gums.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.600]   I've never done that,
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.480]   but I have friends who actually rely on that.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.740]   These are typically former smokers
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.160]   that are trying not to smoke,
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:47.460]   but still want to get some of the focus enhancement
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.320]   that they experience from nicotine.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.320]   Some people are very sensitive to nicotine,
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.280]   and this is important.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.940]   Some people are very sensitive to ingested nicotine.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.320]   So nowadays there are nicotine dipped toothpicks.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.720]   There of course is nicotine gum
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.960]   and other sources of nicotine.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:02.740]   Some people can take that and feel fine.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:05.700]   Some people take it and feel absolutely terrible.
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:08.740]   I confess I've never actually tried nicotine
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.560]   in any of those forms.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.020]   So I don't know how they work for me,
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:14.500]   but some people do use them as cognitive enhancers.
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.880]   In fact, I know one Nobel prize winning neuroscientist
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.560]   who's quite well known in our field
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560]   for chewing Nicorette all day long.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.660]   He insists that it really helps him with his focus
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.860]   and he is exceedingly smart and productive.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.060]   Although I'm sure there are other reasons for that.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:31.100]   Supplements that I have used and do use
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.420]   for increasing acetylcholine
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:37.980]   are things like Alpha-GPC or Hooperzine.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:42.260]   Alpha-GPC is in the choline pathway
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:44.980]   such that more acetylcholine is synthesized
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.140]   after you ingest it.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.840]   That's the general logic or framework of how it works.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.420]   Whereas Hooperzine is mainly in the enzymatic pathway.
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:55.720]   It tends to adjust how much acetylcholine is broken down
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.580]   and lead to net increases in acetylcholine.
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:02.680]   I will often take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:06.380]   prior to workouts or prior to cognitive work bouts.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:07.560]   But when I say often,
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:11.780]   I tend to do this anywhere from three to four times a week,
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:13.480]   typically not every day.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.640]   Although there are people,
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.460]   including people who are trying to offset
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:17.800]   age-related cognitive decline
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.700]   that will take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:22.640]   three times a day every day,
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.640]   which closely mimics some of the studies
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.840]   that have been done on humans,
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.780]   looking at offsetting age-related cognitive decline
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.420]   using things like Alpha-GPC.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.200]   I should point out that there have been a few studies,
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.600]   a few, not many,
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.440]   but these studies emphasize that people
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.480]   who take a lot of Alpha-GPC chronically over time
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.040]   may be at increased risk for stroke.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.380]   I think the data are still out on that
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.960]   and we need more data.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.800]   But for me,
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:51.400]   in terms of thinking about the risk benefit profiles,
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.880]   taking 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.000]   most certainly does increase my ability of focus.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.280]   I've noticed that I tend to take it
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:00.120]   alongside caffeine and phenylethylamine.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:01.760]   So I take that in combination
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.440]   either before workouts or work bouts,
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.800]   really sharpens my focus.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.440]   And again, I'm doing that three, maybe four times per week.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.000]   And I'm careful to do that in the early part of the day
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.280]   so that it does not disrupt my sleep.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.840]   Although I have taken Alpha-GPC
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.240]   in the second half of the day
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.320]   and I had no trouble sleeping at all.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.600]   I don't know what the exact half-life is
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.460]   of the given form that's typically in supplementation.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.500]   It's actually hard to get that information.
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:27.640]   But typically the focus effects wear off
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:30.360]   after about two, maybe four hours maximum.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.640]   Now, one thing that I don't think
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.140]   has ever been discussed before,
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.800]   certainly not on this podcast,
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.540]   is that if you take Alpha-GPC even semi-regularly,
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:42.520]   you may notice that a particular feature
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.180]   of your blood work will increase.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:45.640]   And that's TMAO,
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.480]   which is sometimes associated
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.240]   with increased cardiovascular risk.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.440]   This may, again,
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.900]   may relate to some of the potential risk
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.820]   of very high levels of Alpha-GPC ingestion
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.700]   over many years, increasing stroke risk.
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:00.820]   Again, those studies looked at people
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.040]   who've been taking it for up to a decade.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.740]   But in any case, one way to prevent the increase in TMAO,
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:10.420]   if you're taking Alpha-GPC at all,
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:13.320]   is to take 600 milligrams of garlic
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:15.840]   because it contains something called allicin.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.300]   This was a trick that was handed off to me
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:19.780]   by Dr. Kyle Gillette,
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:21.960]   who, again, was a guest on this podcast some time ago,
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.860]   talking about hormones and hormone health.
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:27.180]   Turns out that ingestion of 600 milligrams of allicin
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:30.280]   alongside or even just same day as Alpha-GPC
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.000]   can really clamp those TMAO levels
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.480]   that would otherwise increase if you're taking Alpha-GPC.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.140]   And indeed, I've done the blood work,
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:38.940]   and that turns out to be the case.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.300]   I saw a spike in TMAO.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:43.180]   I started taking 600 milligrams of garlic,
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.180]   and those TMAO levels came down.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:47.100]   And last, as it relates to acetylcholine,
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.060]   but certainly not least,
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:51.740]   just as acetylcholine can increase focus,
[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.380]   focus can increase acetylcholine.
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:57.400]   I talked a lot about this in the episode on focus,
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.820]   but there are behavioral tools
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:00.540]   that you can use to enhance focus.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:03.580]   Things like staring at a particular visual target
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.180]   at the same distance at which
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.540]   you're going to perform some work
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.460]   and doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.880]   narrowing in a very deliberate way your visual field,
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.760]   and then moving into a focused work bout.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.760]   That behavioral practice of narrowing your visual aperture
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.400]   will increase the amount of acetylcholine transmission
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.160]   in particular neural circuits
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.920]   that will then make it easier to focus.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.800]   How do we know that?
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.120]   Well, I covered in that episode
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.600]   some of the peer-reviewed studies
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:32.840]   that relate to protocols that are now actively
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:36.340]   being deployed in schools in China and elsewhere,
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:40.080]   where kids are doing deliberate visual focus exercises
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.880]   in order to increase their mental focus.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.640]   And while they're not doing micro dialysis
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.120]   or brain imaging on those kids in real time,
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.880]   the cognitive effects and indeed the performance effects
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:52.320]   in terms of academic ability and output
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.480]   are pretty impressive.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.700]   So acetylcholine increases focus.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.160]   We talked about some dietary
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:02.040]   and some supplementation based ways to improve acetylcholine
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.000]   or I should say increase acetylcholine.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.960]   And that does in fact lead to increases
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.880]   in one's ability to focus.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.240]   This is why a lot of the prescription drugs
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.440]   for the treatment of Alzheimer's,
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.400]   age-related cognitive decline,
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.820]   and indeed even some of the drugs
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:19.160]   that tap into treatments for ADHD
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.560]   also involve the acetylcholine system.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.040]   So there's nothing surprising or heretical here,
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.380]   but it is important to point out
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.560]   that your behavioral ability to focus
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.960]   is also related to your ability to access
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.480]   and deploy acetylcholine.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:37.060]   So never do we want purely pharmacologic treatments
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:40.200]   to be the only way that people are increasing
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.400]   a given neuromodulator.
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:45.400]   I always say behaviors first, then nutrition,
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:48.200]   then supplementation, and then if there's a need,
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.240]   certainly a clinical need, then prescription drugs, et cetera,
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.780]   of course administered through a physician.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:55.680]   So let's discuss serotonin.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.200]   Serotonin, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.640]   is associated with brain and body states
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.040]   of wellbeing, of comfort, of satiety,
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.800]   and therefore it should come as no surprise
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.560]   that a lot of the prescription drug treatments
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.000]   for things like depression
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.540]   involve increasing levels of serotonin
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:12.340]   in the brain and body.
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:15.040]   That said, anytime you talk about prescription drugs
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.760]   for serotonin, we also want to acknowledge
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.960]   that there are often side effects associated
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.240]   with increasing serotonin.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.760]   In particular, if serotonin levels go too high,
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.560]   that is if the dosages of those treatments go too high,
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.620]   people will, for instance, feel reduced appetite,
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:32.520]   reduced libido, increased lethargy, et cetera,
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:35.040]   and there's a so-called serotonergic syndrome.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.820]   All of that can and should be considered
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:40.240]   with a well-trained physician.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.720]   So because they're prescription drugs controlling the dosage,
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:48.520]   deciding what dosage to take, deciding which SSRI to take,
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.160]   and whether or not to come off those drugs,
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.480]   how to come off those drugs, again,
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:55.200]   all of that should be handled with a licensed physician.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.640]   That said, there are behavioral tools, nutritional tools,
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.680]   and supplementation tools that can tap
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.120]   into the serotonin system,
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.940]   not to the same degree in potency, but nonetheless,
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:09.320]   in ways that can still impact our feelings of wellbeing
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.160]   in positive ways.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.160]   So let's focus first on the behavioral tools,
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.640]   and some of these might make people chuckle a little bit,
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.200]   but I want to point out that a lot of these tools
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.300]   are quite potent.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.040]   In fact, they are power tools for modulating serotonin,
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:27.000]   and we know that based on human neuroimaging studies,
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.240]   human and animal micro-dialysis studies,
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.240]   and other studies that really have evaluated circulating
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.080]   levels of serotonin and the particular brain circuits
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.120]   that release serotonin when people do certain things.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.360]   What sorts of things?
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.340]   Well, for instance, physical contact,
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.800]   in particular with loved ones, this can be romantic love,
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.600]   this can be children, so your own children,
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.400]   or your spouse, even if it's not sexual contact,
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:58.280]   friend to friend contact, even friend to animal contact.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:01.580]   As a former dog owner, I hope to have another dog soon,
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.360]   'cause unfortunately Costello passed away,
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.600]   but there is something really comforting and wonderful
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.680]   about petting your dog.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.580]   And certainly given that many of the studies on serotonin
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:14.280]   and these other neuromodulators were done on animal models,
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.600]   we also know that serotonin is being evoked in the dog,
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.000]   and of course, in the child,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.860]   and in the significant other, et cetera.
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:23.440]   So things like holding hands, believe it or not,
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.240]   hugs, cuddling, et cetera,
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.360]   can increase serotonin transmission,
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.240]   and they make people feel good.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.160]   This shouldn't really come as a surprise.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.400]   There's also gratitude,
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.640]   and we did an entire episode about gratitude.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:38.060]   There's a lot of misunderstanding about gratitude.
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:40.300]   Oftentimes when people hear gratitude, they think,
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.040]   oh, gratitude, this is just being thankful
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.900]   for what you have, and it's kind of a weak sauce effect,
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:48.760]   meaning it's kind of like maybe a little serotonin goes up,
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:49.600]   or maybe there's a little bit
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.920]   of increased feelings of wellbeing.
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.400]   Nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.160]   It turns out, first of all,
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.960]   that receiving, not giving gratitude,
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.600]   is what has the most potent effects
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.760]   on increasing serotonin and activity of the brain circuits
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.240]   that involve serotonin and that lead to increases
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:06.720]   in feelings of wellbeing.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.120]   So this is interesting.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:12.280]   Receiving much more than giving gratitude
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.800]   is what activates those serotonergic pathways.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.740]   So the takeaway from that is both give and receive gratitude
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.720]   and of course do it in an authentic way.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:21.840]   The other thing about gratitude
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.120]   that's somewhat counterintuitive
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:27.240]   is that observing others giving and receiving gratitude
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:30.460]   is immensely powerful for evoking serotonin
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:32.800]   and the activity of serotonergic circuits
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.480]   in you, the observer.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.920]   So receiving and observing gratitude
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.800]   turns out to be the most potent way
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:41.680]   to increase serotonin in the brain and body.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.400]   And these, again, are dramatic effects
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:46.240]   that are quite long lasting and not the sorts of effects
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:47.480]   that are going to lead to side effects,
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.840]   at least there's no reason to think they would.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.720]   Now, what about nutritional approaches
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.080]   to increasing serotonin?
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.600]   Well, just as we have tyrosine as an amino acid precursor
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.820]   upstream of dopamine synthesis,
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:04.340]   we have the amino acid tryptophan,
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:07.280]   which is upstream of serotonin synthesis.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.580]   And one simply has to go online
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:12.000]   and put in tryptophan containing foods
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.720]   and you will discover that there are a lot of foods
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.360]   that are enriched in tryptophan
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:18.960]   that can lead to net increases in the amount of serotonin
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.560]   available in the brain and body.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.020]   The most kind of famous or infamous of these
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:25.920]   is white meat turkey, the so-called tryptophan effect,
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.340]   where people get very sleepy after eating white meat turkey
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:31.400]   and it is indeed highly enriched in tryptophan.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.660]   Although typically the getting sleepy after eating turkey
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:36.740]   is most often associated with the Thanksgiving meal
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.500]   and the Thanksgiving meal, at least in the US,
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.880]   is often associated with people vastly overeating.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.200]   And so I do want to point out
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.200]   that if you fill your gut with food,
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.120]   no matter what that food is,
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.900]   there's going to be a diversion of blood to your gut
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.080]   that's going to make you feel sleepy
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:51.840]   because there's a diversion of blood away from other tissues.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.720]   So if you eat a lot, you're going to get sleepy, period,
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:56.160]   whether or not you eat turkey or some other substance.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.920]   Nonetheless, there are a number of foods
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.200]   that contain a lot of tryptophan
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.720]   and that some people will leverage
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.700]   in order to try and increase
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:07.520]   the total amount of circulating serotonin available to them
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:10.480]   in order to have a modest increase
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.220]   in overall mood and wellbeing.
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.540]   So what are some of these foods?
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:16.720]   These are things like milk, in particular, whole milk,
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.240]   so full fat milk.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.660]   I know a number of people choose not to drink milk
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:22.500]   'cause they're lactose intolerant.
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.460]   I'm raising my hand 'cause I'm one such person.
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:28.260]   Although when I was a kid, I did enjoy milk.
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:31.220]   Canned tuna, turkey, as we mentioned before,
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.940]   high in tryptophan, oats.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:35.980]   I am a consumer of oatmeal, so that resonates with me.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:38.000]   Cheese, and here I read,
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.400]   although not as high in tryptophan
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:42.100]   as meat and other dairy sources,
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.500]   certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.180]   can be rich in tryptophan.
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:48.240]   Certain nuts and seeds, certain breads.
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:50.060]   Chocolate, I know a number of people
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.440]   will be relieved to hear that.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.500]   I know chocolate lovers are always looking
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.020]   for an excuse to eat chocolate.
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:56.660]   I confess I've never really liked chocolate
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:00.340]   except, dare I say, I like the smooth 100% chocolates.
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:02.500]   I know many people gag when they hear 100%.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.500]   I actually really like them.
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:06.040]   And some fruits can be highly enriched in tryptophan.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:09.340]   Things like bananas and apples and things of that sort,
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:12.300]   although not nearly to the degree of things
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.800]   like turkey, canned tuna, and milk.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:17.640]   I'm sure there are other excellent sources of tryptophan
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:20.220]   from the diet, including vegan sources.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:23.020]   So please peruse the internet to try and find the sources
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.760]   that are compatible with your nutritional program
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.700]   if indeed your goal is to increase tryptophan.
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:31.040]   Now, there are supplements that can increase tryptophan
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.580]   and can do so quite potently.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:36.980]   One of the ones that has received increasing attention
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:41.900]   as of lately is Sissus quadrangularis, complicated name.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:45.680]   When taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.540]   can pretty dramatically increase serotonin levels.
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:53.780]   In fact, anywhere from 30% to 39% increases
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:55.640]   in circulating serotonin.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.780]   That's a big increase.
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:53:59.780]   And I can provide a link to that study.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.700]   The study was focused not so much on serotonin,
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:06.060]   but was focused mainly on treatment of obesity
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:07.900]   and appetite and weight loss.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:11.340]   And it should come as no surprise that serotonin,
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:15.060]   if increased, might lead to decreases in appetite.
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:18.700]   A cautionary note, Sissus quadrangularis
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.020]   may need to be cycled.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:23.620]   How quickly to cycle it, meaning do you do two weeks on,
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:26.460]   two weeks off, whether or not you need to do
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:29.220]   more rapid cycling, like two days on, two days off,
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:30.420]   is a matter of debate.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:33.220]   There are not a lot of data on this just yet.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.240]   There are a lot of opinions about this on the internet,
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.880]   but again, not a lot of quality peer review data.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:40.260]   Nonetheless, Sissus quadrangularis has been showed
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.820]   to potently increase serotonin in humans.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.560]   And for people that are seeking to increase serotonin,
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:49.180]   maybe in particular, for sake of appetite and weight control,
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.080]   that might be a useful compound.
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.500]   I know many people also take 5-HTP,
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.700]   one of the precursors to serotonin in dosages
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:58.980]   of anywhere from 300 to 500 milligrams.
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:02.240]   Typically, people are doing this in anticipation of sleep,
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.380]   meaning in the final hour of wakefulness
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:06.220]   before going to sleep.
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:08.940]   I, myself, have tried 5-HTP prior to sleep,
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.520]   and all I can tell you is that it led to very deep sleep
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.740]   for about one to three hours,
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:15.100]   and then I woke up and I could not fall back asleep.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.600]   I ran that experiment twice before I decided
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.680]   to abandon 5-HTP as a sleep aid,
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:22.700]   and that's why I've never put it into our sleep kit,
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:24.860]   or at least my sleep kit.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.740]   And when I refer to the sleep kit,
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.740]   that's something you can find at hubermanlab.com.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:30.900]   This is a zero-cost resource where you can see
[01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:34.560]   behavioral tools and also supplementation tools
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.940]   that can improve the transition time into
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:38.020]   and the depth of sleep,
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:41.580]   and none of those rely on 5-HTP supplementation.
[01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:43.220]   That said, I know a number of people
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:47.180]   use 5-HTP supplementation outside of sleep,
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:48.460]   or I should say during the daytime,
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:50.020]   to try and increase serotonin,
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:52.940]   and it will indeed increase circulating serotonin.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:55.500]   But again, people vary in their sensitivity
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.040]   to these sorts of things.
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.420]   Some people might find, for instance,
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:01.780]   that 300 milligrams of 5-HTP is just far too much.
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:04.800]   It blunts their appetite, might even reduce libido.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.760]   There aren't a lot of very well-controlled studies
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:08.940]   looking at this, and so it has to be figured out
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:12.360]   on an individual basis if you decide to approach it at all.
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.860]   Now, one molecule that I've found
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.180]   to be particularly interesting and useful,
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:18.220]   and this is one that I haven't talked about yet
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:23.100]   on this podcast, is inositol, in particular, myoinositol.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:27.180]   Myoinositol can have the effect of increasing serotonin
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:30.980]   and other neurochemicals, but primarily,
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.440]   at least in terms of the neuromodulators discussed today,
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:34.620]   serotonin.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:37.980]   I've been taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:40.620]   every third night or so as a test of its ability
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.900]   to improve sleep, and I have to say,
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:46.100]   the depth and quality of sleep that I've been obtaining
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:49.260]   on myoinositol is pretty remarkable.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:52.080]   In fact, I've used it alone and in combination
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.360]   with the magnesium threonate apigenin/theanine sleep kit
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.780]   that I've talked about and that's included in that,
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:00.340]   again, zero-cost kit that's available as a PDF
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.340]   on our website.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:04.200]   So myoinositol is known to increase circulating levels
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:05.380]   of serotonin.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:09.140]   It has been explored extensively in both animal models
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:13.300]   and in humans for its daytime use for treating anxiety.
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:15.380]   It does seem to reduce anxiety,
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:17.260]   and for all sorts of things.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.460]   It's been explored for bipolar disorder.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.420]   We're going to do an episode
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.900]   about bipolar disorder coming up.
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:25.080]   It's been explored for the treatment of migraine.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.000]   It's been explored for ADHD.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.060]   It's been explored for a huge number
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.300]   of different conditions of brain and body.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:34.980]   Again, I've been using the 900 milligrams of myoinositol
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.100]   in the 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to improve my sleep,
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:40.180]   and it has been doing that very dramatically,
[01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:43.140]   especially when I take it alongside the rest
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:45.260]   of those sleep kit supplements.
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.020]   A quick note about myoinositol
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:49.360]   for sake of increasing serotonin.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.020]   If you look at the human studies on myoinositol
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:53.060]   that are out there,
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:55.420]   and in particular focus on the human studies,
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:58.100]   what you'll find is that the dosages that are often used
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.480]   are tremendously high, things like five grams, eight grams,
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.300]   18 grams of myoinositol taken throughout the day.
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:06.900]   I don't know how people stomach that.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:09.100]   And in fact, many people drop out of those studies
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.860]   because of gastric discomfort.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:14.440]   And yet I also wonder how people tolerate it
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.420]   because it has somewhat of a sedative effect
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.520]   and it's kind of anti-anxiety effect.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.280]   And I can't even imagine,
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.420]   given my experience with 900 milligrams,
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:25.260]   what one would experience taking multiple
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.540]   or many more grams per day.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:30.460]   So I certainly am not encouraging that.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:32.820]   And the only reason I mentioned myoinositol
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.520]   is that it has a known effect of increasing serotonin.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.020]   At least in my experience,
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:40.360]   it does not lead to this falling deeply asleep
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.380]   and waking back up.
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.380]   Actually to the contrary,
[01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:43.540]   if I wake up in the middle of the night
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:45.500]   to use the bathroom or I wake up in the middle of the night
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.000]   for whatever other reason,
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.760]   I find it far easier to fall back asleep
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:53.940]   if I've taken 900 milligrams inositol prior to sleep.
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:56.960]   So for me, it's proving to be a quite useful compound.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:00.700]   I'm not aware of having any serotonergic deficiency overall.
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.560]   I don't consider myself depressed.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:05.540]   And of course, I should mention that no supplement,
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:08.220]   either added or withdrawn from your protocol,
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:11.300]   should ever be used as a direct replacement
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:12.620]   for prescription drug treatments
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:13.660]   that your physician has given you.
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:15.000]   You should always talk to your physician
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.780]   anytime you remove or add something to your drug protocol
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:20.680]   or prescription protocol, of course.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.780]   So we've got behavioral protocols
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:25.740]   that as silly as it feels to say,
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:27.820]   have been shown to potently increase serotonin,
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:30.540]   things like physical contact, cuddling, holding hands
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:32.860]   with people that you love, of course, right?
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:35.380]   I think if they were people that you despised,
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:38.380]   it would have the opposite effect for obvious reasons.
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:42.100]   But also receiving gratitude and observing gratitude,
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.240]   very potent increases in serotonin.
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:47.180]   And things like cystis quadrangularis,
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:50.060]   things like 5-HTP may have their uses, right?
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:53.220]   They're very potent at increasing serotonin,
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:56.140]   but they do seem to have the need to cycle them
[01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.580]   and they are nuanced.
[01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:00.860]   Some people respond well to them, others like myself don't.
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:03.860]   And of course, always be on the lookout for dramatic
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:06.260]   or even subtle decreases in appetite or libido
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:08.260]   or things that you might not want
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:10.060]   if you are going to be tinkering
[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:13.260]   with your serotonergic levels and pathways.
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.640]   And then myoinositol actually is proving
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.660]   to be quite useful to me.
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:20.300]   And whether or not that's because of its effects
[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:22.820]   on serotonin or through some of its other effects
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:25.820]   on maybe reducing anxiety, which certainly I experience
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:26.780]   if I wake up in the middle of the night,
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:28.340]   I don't like waking up in the middle of the night,
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.780]   but on myoinositol, I sort of seem to not really care
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:32.480]   that I woke up and I fall right back asleep.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.660]   So the direct source of the positive effects
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.060]   that I'm getting aren't clear,
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:37.780]   but nonetheless, I thought I'd pass it along
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.500]   as a useful tool because it is out there
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.740]   and it is available over the counter.
[02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:45.180]   And provided you're taking the appropriate safety steps
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:47.820]   in considering whether or not to use it or not,
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.880]   I think it might be a useful tool.
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:52.660]   And of course, as with all the other neuromodulators
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:56.740]   we discussed, you have both a baseline of serotonin
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:59.820]   and the ability to give or provide yourself peaks
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:02.180]   of serotonin through these various protocols.
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:05.580]   The dietary interventions of the sort that I mentioned,
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.460]   meaning eating foods that are enriched in tryptophan,
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:10.420]   those are mainly going to adjust
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.780]   your baseline levels of tryptophan.
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:15.180]   For instance, if you really want to be sleepy,
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.140]   sure, you could eat some white meat turkey
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:20.140]   in hopes that that tryptophan will convert to serotonin
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:21.800]   and make you sleepy, et cetera.
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:22.640]   But in general,
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.900]   those are going to be pretty long lasting effects,
[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:27.260]   especially given the fact that not all of the tryptophan
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:30.300]   you will ingest is going to be converted into serotonin
[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:31.540]   in your brain.
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:33.520]   It's going to have other effects on other tissues
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:35.020]   and organs of your body.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:37.460]   Nonetheless, if you want to increase serotonin,
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.300]   providing the appropriate baseline context
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:41.500]   is going to be useful.
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:43.260]   And again, this is a general theme
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:45.500]   of all four of these neuromodulators,
[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.340]   dopamine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin.
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:51.900]   You want to make sure that you have sufficient baseline
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.460]   levels of those things through things like diet,
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:55.940]   regular behaviors,
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:59.400]   and then you have the opportunity to use supplementation.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:00.500]   And if it's appropriate for you,
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:03.320]   prescription drugs and certain behavioral protocols
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.120]   to try and get these potent increases,
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:08.420]   these acute increases in whichever the neuromodulators
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.880]   you happen to want to leverage for your particular goals.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.880]   So that brings us to the end of at least this exploration
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:18.280]   of the neuromodulators, dopamine, epinephrine,
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.120]   acetylcholine, and serotonin.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.320]   Some of you who are regular listeners of this podcast
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.560]   might be saying, well, we've heard all this before, right?
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:25.800]   You had an episode on dopamine.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:27.160]   You had an episode on anxiety.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.480]   You had an episode on sleep.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:30.440]   And indeed that's true.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:33.720]   But what I've tried to provide today is a framework
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:36.280]   that cuts through all those episodes.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.680]   And at the same time builds out a new
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:41.080]   and what I believe to be a really important theme
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.040]   and principle, which is that whether or not
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:47.420]   you're using nutritional tools or supplementation
[02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:51.360]   or prescription drugs or any other sort of protocol
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:54.680]   to try and create a desired effect of focus
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:57.640]   or energy, motivation, relaxation,
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.920]   you're playing with the same neurochemical ingredients.
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:05.540]   Just as in the realm of nutrition, you have macronutrients,
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:08.040]   you have proteins, carbohydrates, and fats
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.840]   that can be adjusted in different ratios
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.900]   and arranged at different times
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:14.680]   in order to achieve certain desired effects.
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:17.140]   Well, when it comes to your neurochemistry
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.120]   and your ability to perform mentally,
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.960]   to perform physically, and your overall wellbeing,
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:26.300]   you are dealing with a small handful
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.460]   of especially potent molecules.
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:31.900]   And I acknowledge that there are many neuromodulators,
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:33.780]   there are indeed many neurotransmitters,
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.260]   glutamine, glycine, GABA, et cetera.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:38.600]   But today we focused on the main four,
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.400]   meaning the most potent and most widespread neuromodulators
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:46.680]   in the brain and body that give you access
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:49.660]   to particular brain states and body states
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:51.900]   of the sort that most people desire.
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:54.940]   So what I'm hoping is that rather than decide
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:56.980]   that any one tool is the most useful
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:00.140]   or that any one neurochemical is most useful
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:02.260]   for that matter, that the information
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:07.140]   that I've provided today allows you a kit of versatile tools
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:11.100]   that allows you to figure out what levels of dopamine
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:13.660]   and augmentation of dopamine are appropriate
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:14.980]   and necessary for you.
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.620]   What levels of acetylcholine and tools
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:21.220]   for manipulating acetylcholine are going to be most useful
[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:23.160]   for you and so on and so forth.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:26.700]   Because at least at this stage in time,
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:31.700]   that is June, 2022, there is no simple at-home test.
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:34.820]   In fact, there is no simple laboratory test
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:37.220]   that allows us to know whether or not our dopamine levels
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.240]   are high and our serotonin levels are low.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:41.180]   We can look at somebody and their behavior,
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.020]   we can look at ourselves and our own mood and behavior,
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:48.720]   and we can infer what those levels may or may not be.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.020]   But unfortunately we don't have a really good test
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:55.180]   of dopamine levels or serotonin levels
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:58.460]   that would allow us to say, okay, this person
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.860]   or I need to increase dopamine twofold
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:04.840]   in order to achieve the kind of motivation that we want.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.160]   Unfortunately, that doesn't exist.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:09.000]   Rather, we are confronted with a situation
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.400]   where we understand generally
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.960]   what these different neuromodulators do,
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.920]   the different mental states and physical states
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:17.840]   that they tend to put us into, and we reviewed those.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:21.720]   And we know that there are really potent tools
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.100]   to adjust those neuromodulators, if not alone,
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:26.880]   but in certain combinations.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:30.320]   That is ingestion of caffeine will tap into
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:33.720]   and support dopamine and epinephrine.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.160]   Increasing dopamine and epinephrine
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.360]   alongside increasing acetylcholine
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:41.480]   will allow us to access certain brain states,
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:44.680]   that is focused, alert, energized brain states,
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:47.780]   great for learning and plasticity of all kinds.
[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:50.560]   Whereas augmenting serotonin is going to put us
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:53.080]   into a more relaxed state and so on and so forth.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.640]   And I'd like you to keep in mind
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:57.800]   that there is no negotiating the fact
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:01.000]   that we all have different phases of our 24 hour cycle
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.240]   during which those very same neuromodulators
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:05.840]   tend to be naturally higher or naturally lower.
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:08.160]   And I reviewed that at the beginning of the episode.
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:11.060]   So my wish for you is that you will take this information,
[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:15.400]   experiment with it as you see fit for you and in a safe way.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:19.600]   And as you go forward to really try and gain intuition
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:23.400]   and understanding as to not just how these protocols work,
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:26.120]   but how any protocol that you might encounter,
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:29.660]   supplement-based, drug-based, behavioral-based,
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:31.280]   how those might tap into these different
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:32.840]   major neuromodulator systems.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:36.200]   And from that, to be able to better predict and evaluate
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.920]   whether or not they're going to be useful to you,
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:40.160]   detrimental to you, or whether or not they should be used
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:42.800]   in combinations that would be more useful to you.
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:45.120]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:07.140]   We do eventually read all those comments,
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:10.540]   and that's the best place to give us that sort of feedback.
[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:12.660]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:14.120]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:17.060]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:19.740]   During today's episode, we talked a lot about supplements.
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.000]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.460]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:26.300]   As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.400]   we partnered with Momentous Supplements
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.920]   because they're extremely high quality,
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:33.580]   they ship internationally, they are available in the dosages
[02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:36.520]   and single ingredient formulations that are ideal
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:38.220]   for building a supplementation protocol.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:41.820]   You can find all those at livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.060]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:48.460]   we are @hubermanlab on Twitter and @hubermanlab on Instagram.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.820]   There I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:52.460]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:54.100]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.100]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:57.820]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.980]   And if you're not already subscribing to our newsletter,
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:02.500]   we have a neural network newsletter, as it's called,
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:04.580]   that comes out about once a month.
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:07.620]   We provide summaries, we provide protocols
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:09.420]   based on podcast episodes.
[02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:11.140]   All of that is zero cost to access.
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:13.860]   You just go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu,
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:15.580]   click on newsletter, and you can sign up.
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.620]   We do not share your email with anybody,
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:19.740]   and our privacy policy is there.
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:22.060]   In fact, if you want to see previous newsletters,
[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:25.620]   they are available without having to sign up in PDF form,
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:28.560]   also at hubermanlab.com under the newsletter tabs,
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.260]   things like a toolkit for sleep
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:32.300]   and a neuroplasticity super protocol,
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:35.180]   all available as immediately downloadable PDFs.
[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:38.020]   So I'd like to thank you once again for joining me today
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:41.020]   in our discussion about these incredibly powerful molecules
[02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:46.020]   we call neuromodulators and the things we can do and take
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:49.040]   in order to control them so that we can enhance
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:51.480]   our mental health, physical health, and performance.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.920]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.740]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:58.320]   [upbeat music]
