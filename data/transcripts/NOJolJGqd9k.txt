[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   All right, so we got a question here, not really a name.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.800]   This person's name is supposedly Deep Work vs. Study and Recall.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.600]   So I don't know, maybe it's a foreign name.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.200]   Oh no, here's a name, it's down here.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   Arnav.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.640]   Okay, he signed the message.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.640]   That's better.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   All right, Arnav says, "Hi Cal.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560]   In the book Deep Work, you said that working for hours with high intensity is necessary
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.520]   for producing, thriving, and learning new things, but in your Red Book," which is How
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.520]   to Become a Straight A Student, "you said don't work for more than about an hour or
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.400]   50 minutes at a time.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.000]   These ideas have confused me.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   I want to know when to use Deep Work in a student life."
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.960]   Well, Arnav, the key to understanding this discrepancy, the 50 minute to an hour suggestion
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.760]   from Straight A Student and all the case studies of people doing Deep Work for long periods
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.880]   of time is that Deep Work for long periods of time have a natural ebb and flow of intensity.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.520]   So there's periods in which you're like really locked in and then you let the intensity ebb,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.680]   and then you lock back in again really hard, then you let the intensity ebb.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.480]   I mean, if you sat there and could monitor the mental exertions of a computer programmer,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.880]   for example, this is what you would see.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.320]   There's going to be periods where they're really trying to hold all the pieces of this
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   algorithm together so they can, "I want this to work, right?
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.200]   So I've got to do this just right."
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.660]   And that's really high intensity.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.000]   And then there's the, "I'm running, compiling the code, you know, waiting for the debugging
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.100]   messages and the intensity drops."
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.680]   And Straight A Student, that 50 minute to an hour rule is talking about the specific
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.920]   highly intense activity of doing active recall studying.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.440]   It's a really intellectually demanding thing where you're trying to replicate from scratch
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.480]   whatever the information is that you're trying to learn.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.860]   You replicate it from scratch without looking at notes as if you were lecturing a class.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.760]   That's at the core of how I recommend in that book cementing knowledge.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.920]   That's super high intensity.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   That's the computer programmer trying to get the, writing the algorithm, has to get it
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.240]   just right.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.640]   And there I was recommending about 50 minutes to an hour because you have to give your brain
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   a break.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.720]   You would give it 10 minutes, then come back into it again.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.480]   So if you're a student that's studying for three hours, what you're probably doing is
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.800]   50 minutes high, 10 or 15 minutes low, 50 minutes high, 10 or 15 minutes low.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.460]   And that's how you put those two things together.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.100]   So deep work in general ebbs and flows, active recall is a particular deep work activity
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.840]   that is incredibly focused.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.560]   And so you can only sustain that for so long without having to have a breather.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.120]   The key thing to remember though, is what do you do when your energy, you're in an ebb,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.560]   you've been doing active recall for 50 minutes.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.400]   Now you're taking a 10 minute break, you're coding, you were focused in really hard, but
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.560]   now you're waiting for your code to compile and you have five minutes.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.480]   The thing I always come back to is if you're going to have to take a break from what you're
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.680]   doing, make sure that whatever you consume, whatever you encounter, make sure that it's
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.360]   not emotionally salient.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.040]   So something that's going to get you emotionally activated and not very specifically related
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.840]   to the type of work you're doing.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.240]   So in other words, no Twitter, no email.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.360]   If you go on Twitter or Instagram or Tik Tok or what have you, while you're waiting for
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.040]   the code to compile, you might see something that really activates your emotions and that's
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.320]   going to induce a much more severe context switch, which means it's going to take longer
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.640]   to get back to your code.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   Similarly, if you go and check your email, you're going to see a lot of open loop obligations
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.560]   that are related to work, but not exactly what you're working on.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.200]   And that's going to hijack your brain.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.960]   It's going to take a long time to context switch away from that as well.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.800]   So during those ebbs, nothing that's emotionally salient, nothing that is sort of highly relevant,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.640]   but not quite the same as the work that you're currently doing.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.840]   I recommend looking at baseball news.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   That's been my go-to.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.560]   I'm glad baseball is back and it is not emotionally salient and it is not related to work.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.720]   And that has been good for me for sure.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.280]   Now, Jesse, I'm in the sort of news break right now because I have like a lot of work
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.720]   going on and sort of high like scheduling anxiety, but it raises my anxiety floor.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.040]   And so I'm basically saying the only news I'm consuming right now is baseball news.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.920]   And it's been great.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.880]   Actually it's really kind of helped tamp down the sort of anxiety floor a little bit.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.160]   When you have that instinct of, I want to just see what's going on, they say, let me
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.960]   just go look at, you know, how this prospect is progressing.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.840]   Actually, I want you, one of your guests online to be Scott Boris.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600]   I want to hear you talk to him.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.920]   We should get Scott.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.680]   Scott should represent us.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.960]   Scott Boris is going to represent us to our sponsors maybe.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.720]   Like, Hey, this would be Scott.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   All right.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   All right.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   Monk Pack.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.440]   I see your offer.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.000]   You're offering 30 CPM.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.640]   Here's my return offer.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.200]   $20 million.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.720]   $20 million if you want to be on the show.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.160]   And if you don't want to pay the $20 million to be on the show, we'll walk.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.120]   I'm sure there's other bar companies out there that would gladly pay it.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.920]   And so $20 million and also our only sponsor would be the Washington Nationals.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.120]   So that's basically just only moves clients to the Washington Nationals.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.520]   Baseball insider chat.
