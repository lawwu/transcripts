[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [Music]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.320]   Pastor John, before taking your leave of absence in 2010, you preached an important
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   sermon at Bethlehem Baptist Church titled "How Much Does God Love This Church?"
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.280]   That was on April 18th of 2010, and the sermon deals with the fact that God does
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.280]   make much of us as Christians. It would eventually become a new chapter titled
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.440]   "God Does Make Much of Us" in your recently re-released book, "Brothers, We Are Not
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.040]   Professionals." Explain for us the background to this sermon and the chapter
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   and its importance in your thinking that God does make much of us. Was this point
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.520]   a point of correction to your theology? Was it a deepening or a broadening? How
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.920]   do you think of it? The sermon, and it was probably the third time I had preached
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.560]   something like that, I did something like that at Westmont College, and I
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.440]   did something like that at Passion. There was a whole series of messages. All of
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.840]   them, I would say, were given not by way of correction, but by way of
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.080]   clarification and reprioritization. I have really benefited over the years
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   from feedback, and on this issue, Tom Steller, my associate for 33 years at
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.760]   Bethlehem, was the most influential because Tom would never let me get away
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.640]   with saying anything of an exaggerated nature without his drawing my attention
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.320]   to the other side of the coin, and on this one, there is another side of the
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.000]   coin. Here's the background. I used to go all over the country saying,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.680]   "Which makes you feel more loved by God? That he makes much of you, or that he
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.960]   enables you at great cost to himself to enjoy making much of him?" It's a pretty
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.040]   provocative question, pretty thought-provoking. I still like the question. I'll still use
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.680]   the question. The answer I meant for people to give was true love is not
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.040]   mainly God's true love. The highest divine love is not mainly God making
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.160]   much of us, but giving the highest price imaginable in his Son to free us from
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.020]   our bondage to joy-destroying self so that we could enjoy making much of him
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.700]   forever. I really believe with all my heart, Tony, that we are created, human
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.680]   beings are created for joy in God, for admiring God, for being amazed at God, for
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.520]   standing in awe of God and wondering at God, and God is the source of all that,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.840]   and anything that detracts from that I'm going to resist with all my might. We are
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:57.480]   created for joy in God. But part of the wonder of God that we take joy in is in
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.160]   fact possible because he makes much of us and is constituted by his making
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.360]   much of us. And in that sermon I just rattled off with text—I won't
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.560]   give the text here—but here's what I meant by God making much of us. He makes
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.360]   much of us in being pleased with us and commending our lives in the end. Well
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.040]   done. He makes much of us by making us his fellow heirs with his Son who owns
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.680]   everything. He makes much of us by having a sit with him at table, and he serves us
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.760]   according to Luke 12. He makes much of us by appointing us to carry out the
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.320]   judgment of angels. Good night! What an incredible role that he gives to us.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.080]   He makes much of us by ascribing value to us. You're more valuable than the
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.600]   than the birds, you're the apple of my eye. He makes much of us by giving us a
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.040]   glorious body like Jesus' body that will reflect his glory like Jesus did, and
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.720]   he makes much of us most amazingly of all by saying that we will sit with
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.640]   Christ on his throne, whatever that means. I mean, we will be co-rulers
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.880]   of the world. So there's just no doubt, and I have never doubted, that God makes
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.960]   much of us in all these senses. So it's not a change of theology, but it is a
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   reprioritization because I didn't preach those seven points in those
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.760]   sermons where I asked that question usually. I left that unsaid, feeling like
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.800]   the other needed the emphasis, and I have now tried to balance that better by
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.520]   drawing people's attention to the truth that God does make much of us. But I
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.040]   ended that sermon by asking the question, "Now why is it that God performs all
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.920]   these acts of love toward us by continually drawing attention to the
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.320]   fact that he's doing it for his own glory? He's doing it for his name's sake?"
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:14.960]   And my answer to that is that if God made me and myself the end of my goal, my
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.440]   quest, he wouldn't love me so much as if he made himself the end of my goal and
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.360]   my quest, because self, no matter how glorified, no matter how made much of,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:37.400]   will never satisfy my heart. I must look away from my made much of self in order
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   to see God truly and love him as my final treasure. And therefore, I think God
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.040]   makes much of us precisely so that we will have the greater capacity to enjoy
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.080]   him. Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. The sermon title again is "How Much Does God
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.720]   Love This Church?" which was preached on April 18th, 2010. Also see the new chapter,
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.160]   "God Does Make Much of Us," in the recently re-released book, "Brothers, We Are Not
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.560]   Professionals." You can find both of those resources at DesiringGod.org,

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.520]   your host Tony Ranke, thanks for listening.
