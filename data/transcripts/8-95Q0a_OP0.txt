[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   We talked about Burger King and their support of gay marriage back in episode
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.780]   number 394. As a follow-up, Joe writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, Apple and
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.720]   Subaru have openly supported homosexual marriage. Last night my wife brought up
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.800]   the fact that Target is now doing the same. This seems like a question that a
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.680]   lot of people are probably asking or thinking about right now. As Christian,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.080]   should the fact that a company openly supports gay marriage affect our
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   purchasing decisions?" Okay, this is a really crucial question. Not because of
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.280]   the importance of boycotting, that's not the point, but because of the principle
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.760]   of allegiance to Jesus that can be compromised when someone forces on you
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.040]   the issue of your identification with sin. So here's a little background. Some
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.120]   weeks ago I said goodbye Burger King because of a video they were running
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.840]   that was not only immoral in what it promoted and endorsed sexually, but also
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.400]   because it was lewd in its language. It closed with a little girl hugging two
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.160]   lesbians and saying, "I love my two mommies." This struck me as such a blatant
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.800]   assault on children, on truth, on purity, on God, that I said I can do without
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.200]   Burger King. Goodbye Burger King. I'll go to Chick-fil-A. This was not a
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.240]   prescription for others. I'm not telling anybody else they have to do this and
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.800]   I'm not at all saying in order not to sin you have to boycott Burger King.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.680]   No way. I'm not saying that. It was a statement from my own life and conscience.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.240]   Now the question is raised, so what do we do as more and more companies declare
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.400]   themselves corporately to embrace and endorse and promote behaviors that God
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.560]   says will destroy people's souls? And the principle I want to apply to this comes
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.200]   from 1st Corinthians 10, where Paul is dealing with meat offered to idols. And
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.680]   the specific situation is, what if you are invited to eat with an unbeliever
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.600]   who serves meat offered to idols? And here's Paul's answer. If one of the
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.720]   unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.600]   set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.320]   You're free. But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.080]   don't eat it for the sake of the one who informed you. In other words, you are free
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.520]   to eat meat offered to idols. But when an unbeliever makes the meal or that
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.760]   occasion into an act of endorsement, then don't. So you see the principle here. The
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.680]   act itself is not sin, but the act of endorsing what the sacrifice to an idol
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   stands for, that is sin. Now let's apply that to companies who have sin in their
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.320]   corporate strategies. It might be environmental sin. It might be corruption
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.560]   at the upper levels. It might be labor injustices and abusive sweatshops
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.320]   overseas. It might be public support for sinful behaviors that the Bible says
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.200]   are going to destroy people in hell. It's not a sin to go to the stores of those
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.080]   companies and purchase things that are not sinful. Let's that be said loud and
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.640]   clear. Say it again. It's not a sin to go to those stores and purchase things that
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.680]   are not sinful. There is no necessary connection between your shopping there
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.400]   and your endorsement of their policies or views. But what if the day comes when
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.680]   any of those stores or some governmental agency forces the issue and makes the
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.480]   connection explicit? To shop at our store is to endorse our policies or to push it
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.840]   just a step further. What if they did not just declare this to be so, but required
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:46.080]   all customers to sign a release that they did in fact agree with the policies
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.520]   of the company and then the endorsement of sin. So I think at that point the
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:01.640]   choice is clear. We go without. And yes, I can imagine a society that
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:10.040]   intentionally starves Christians to death in this way. This is what all
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   persecution comes down to. Your allegiance to a false God and a false
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   sinful soul-destroying way of life or your life will be paid. Now for now we
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.200]   have the relative luxury in America still of simply making statements by
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.400]   boycotting like I did. We have the luxury to do that and we can go anywhere we we
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.680]   choose. Not go or go. I don't think we're at the point where using an Apple
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.600]   computer is to endorse the gay pride parade that Apple sponsored. But that day
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.000]   may come and eventually the price will not just be between computers but
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.960]   between life and death. Whether that day comes soon in America or is postponed
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.720]   for a thousand years by a glorious spiritual awakening, it will come. It will
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.000]   come. And the reason I know it will come is because of Revelation 13 15 to 17.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.280]   Here's what it says. This is incredibly relevant to this present moment. The
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   beast, this Antichrist figure, the beast causes those who would not worship his
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   image to be slain. How does he do that? Verse 16. Also it causes all both small
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.120]   and great, both rich and poor, both slave and free, to be marked on the right hand
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:46.760]   or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark. That is
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.920]   the name of the beast, the number of its name. So you will endorse the sin of the
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.840]   beast or you will not be able to shop anywhere because he owns all the stores.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:08.120]   And you will die or you will forsake Jesus. So the principle of 1st
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.520]   Corinthians 10 for now does not require us to not shop at stores which endorse
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.120]   sin because there's no necessary correlation. But the closer our shopping
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.880]   correlates with endorsed soul-destroying, God-dishonoring sins, the stronger
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.840]   becomes the hindrance to shopping. Thank you, Pastor John. And we talked about
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.760]   Burger King's celebration of gay marriage back in episode number 394 of
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.520]   this podcast. Be sure to check that out. So why do we make such a big deal about
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.280]   Burger King and corporations that applaud sexual sin? Aren't there more
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.560]   important issues to talk about than getting into people's private sexuality?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.480]   What about ISIS? And what about a possible nuclear war with Russia? I mean,
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.720]   aren't those greater concerns? Actually, tomorrow Pastor John will give a defense
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.960]   for why confronting sexual sin like lust and homosexuality are of even greater
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.680]   concern for us than whether Vladimir Putin is stirring up World War III. I'm
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.880]   your host Tony Rehnke. We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
