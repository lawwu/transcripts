[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   - What's your mind allocation, right?
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.360]   I think about this, you know, like, where's my brain?
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.720]   Is it, am I focused on what's going on in here?
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.660]   And, you know, is there a need to excavate there?
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.080]   Sure, you know, but how much time am I out of my head
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.120]   and bringing things in from the outside world
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.300]   and back and forth?
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.140]   So do you have some sense of across the year,
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.520]   across the day, how you mind allocate?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.680]   I don't know if that's the best phrase,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.300]   but I can't think of any better one.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.360]   If you can think of a better one, please, please table it.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.920]   'Cause I'm happy to use that.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.240]   - Yeah, how do I think about mind allocation
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.500]   or attention allocation?
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.240]   I try to, and most frequently think of my mind share
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.760]   across a year and across week, a weekly timeframe.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:03.800]   And I find that to be manageable in the sense that on a yearly basis,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.220]   on New Year's Eve or roughly around New Year's,
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.760]   every year I'll do a past year review, PYR, past year review,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.460]   where I'll go back and I'll look at my entire last year,
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.880]   a piece of paper in front of me, line down the center, plus negative.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.500]   And I will go through every week in my calendar for the previous year.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.880]   And I will write down the people, places, activities, commitments, et cetera,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.720]   that produced peak positive emotional experiences.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.120]   So, right, we're doing an 80/20 analysis here.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120]   Like what are the big rocks that really moved the needle in a meaningful way?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.500]   And conversely, who are the people, what are the things, what are the places that just made me go, ugh.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.680]   And we're draining produced peak negative experiences.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.180]   Why the hell did I commit to this type experiences?
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.680]   And that presents me with a do more of, do less of list.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.060]   And then I look forward to the next year, and I did this, I suppose, just a handful of months ago around New Year's with the positive.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.660]   I'm like, okay, here's my list of do more of.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.360]   It's not real until it's in the calendar.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.240]   Let's get these things in the calendar.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:29.000]   And then I will start talking to people, booking things, having people help with organizing if that is required, and getting things blocked out.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.800]   So I have already this year, and we're in the reasonable beginning stages of the year, I have things blocked out until November of this year.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.980]   And those provide the breaks in the action, not just the breaks in the action, but the fun stuff.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.080]   Because, by the way, guys, I thought for a long time, like, yeah, you take care of A, B, and C, and the good stuff just takes care of itself.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.860]   I have, I do not any longer believe that to be true.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.200]   Unless you schedule these things that you claim are important, they're going to get crowded out by bullshit.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.380]   And maybe not bullshit, but just less important things.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.380]   The urgent will crush the important.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:18.560]   So I get these things on the calendar, and then I back up and I look at optimal weekly mind allocation, right?
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.620]   Attentional allocation.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.520]   And there's an incredible cost to cognitive switching if you're just test switching all day.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:39.600]   So I will try my best to format a weekly rhythm, a weekly sequence that allows me to focus on certain types of tasks.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.540]   So Monday is very frequently admin of some type.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.860]   Just bits and ends, flotsam, jetsam, all the miscellaneous pieces that are part of life.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.840]   You got to deal with them.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.180]   That tends to be Monday.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.180]   Whenever possible, and especially if I am focused on physical activity, let's just say I'm in a place like Colorado,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:12.260]   I will try to schedule most of that for after lunch to ensure that I get in a lot of exercise and movement in the first portion of the day.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.720]   Not everybody has that ability, but I will say more of you have that capacity than you might think,
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.900]   because most of what we all do is just not important.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.700]   Time on social media first thing in the morning is probably the most poisonous activity that I could take part in.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.420]   I don't want to point fingers at anyone else, but I think if people ask, you know,
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.440]   what is the amount of time it takes to get in a really good workout?
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.940]   It's going to be about an hour, you know, but a lot can be done in 45 if we're even 30 minutes.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.380]   You think about how quickly that time goes by on social media.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.140]   Like, I'm sure I'm not the only one that was part of the reason I deleted a lot of these apps from my phone.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.920]   It's like I would be, I'd go into the bathroom to take a quick bit of business, and then 45 minutes later, I'm like,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.420]   how have I been looking at Instagram for 45 minutes?
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.940]   Yeah, lines for restrooms have gotten very long in the last 10 years.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.020]   Has anyone noticed that?
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.200]   The wait for the restrooms has gotten very long?
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.620]   So, you have time for the important stuff.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.120]   And just look at some of the extreme overachievers out there.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.660]   They have the same amount of time that you do.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.360]   These companies are very smart.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.680]   They have very good data scientists.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.540]   They have very good UI specialists.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.040]   If anyone out there thinks that they can, like, maybe Jocko can discipline his way through it.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.540]   I'm sure he can because he is Jocko.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.560]   But in my case, and in the case of most people, like, you're bringing a knife to a gunfight.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.840]   If you think you can use your self-control to keep your use of Instagram to, say, 10 minutes at a clip, good luck.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.500]   And even if you can, people say, ah, but I do that anyway.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.100]   I'm like, all right, how much time do you spend sending memes and links from Instagram or fill-in-the-blank platform to your friends and group chat?
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.900]   How much time does that consume?
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.660]   I spend a fair amount of time on Instagram and Twitter posting things related to the podcast.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.380]   But I don't have someone to do that for me.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.820]   And I actually enjoy doing it, and it challenges me in certain ways.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.780]   But I completely agree with everything you're saying.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.180]   Twitter has its use cases.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.340]   I find it useful in some respects.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.500]   It has become much less useful and much less practical in the last year with a lot of the product changes.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.840]   But it has its place.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.960]   It's not on my phone.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.860]   It was on my phone for a very brief period of time.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:39.960]   I find that my ability to be still and calm is eroded if I am too easily able to escape boredom.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.820]   If you cease to have the ability to be bored for five to ten minutes, I think that makes you very fragile.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.320]   It makes you very easy to manipulate also.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.540]   And there are a lot of forces at play online that want to manipulate or shape your behavior in different ways.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:11.000]   So I feel like it is imperative for me to cultivate the ability to just sit still and not consume the five minutes in line waiting to get into a restaurant by hopping on Twitter or Instagram.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.860]   So that's part of the reason they're not on my phone.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:23.060]   So that's part of the reason they're not on my phone.
