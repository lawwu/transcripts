[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   In the following sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, the doctor has taken as his text two phrases from Acts chapter 4.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The first from verse 31.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together."
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And the second phrase comes from Acts chapter 4, verse 33.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The last part of that verse.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   "And great grace was upon them all."
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Now, most of you, I'm sure, remember the context here.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   It's a story which we are looking at, a picture of the apostles and the members of the early Christian church meeting together to pray.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   They were doing so because two of their number had been arrested, Peter and John,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and they'd been before the great council, the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   who had prohibited them to preach any more in the name of this Jesus.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   These men, these members of the council, were determined to put an end to the Christian church and to the preaching of the Christian message.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And so Peter and John, being set at liberty, went straight back to their own company, to the members of the church,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and they reported to them this verdict, this edict of the council.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And the church felt at once that the position was so desperate and so hopeless, there was only one thing for them to do.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   They immediately began to pray.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We are told that with one accord they lifted up their voice to God and they prayed to him.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   "And having magnified God and his grace, and having thanked him for his greatness and his glory,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   they end their prayer by saying, 'And now, Lord, behold their threatenings,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   by stretching forth thine hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.'
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And when they had prayed," now we are dealing tonight, you see, with the answer to the prayer.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   "When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and great grace was upon them all."
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Now, we've been studying this, as most of you know, for a number of weeks,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   and we come to our last study this evening.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And now I'm calling your attention, I say, just to those two statements.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   "When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and great grace was upon them all."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Those are the two results, two of the chief results, at any rate,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   of this prayer that was offered by these people.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Let me remind you that I'm calling your attention to this
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   because we have here a very perfect picture as to what Christianity really is,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   what it's about, what the Church is meant to be, and what the Gospel is.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Is there a greater tragedy than this?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That the world doesn't know what it's all about.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   What is Christmas? How did you spend it yesterday?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   What did it mean to you? What does it mean to the world?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What a gulf there is fixed between what the world assumes Christianity to be
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and what we find here recorded in the New Testament itself.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But, my dear friends, this and this alone is true Christianity.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The other is what men think it is and what men have made of it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It isn't the real thing, it isn't the true thing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   If you would really know what it means and what it's all about,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   well then, I say, you've got to come back here and to study this record
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and to believe what it teaches you.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This is the only truth because this is the truth.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   What we read in the rest of the New Testament came to pass
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and the whole story of the Christian Church begins to bear some meaning and sense for us.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Now then, I'm holding these two phrases before you
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   because I want to try to show you that in a very wonderful way
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   they do tell us what are, if you like, the two focal points
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   of the message of the whole of the Bible and the message of the Christian Gospel.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We are meeting together on the last night of an old year.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   In a sense that doesn't matter, but in a sense it does also.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   There is some purpose in all this as there is in a birthday.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Every birthday you have is a time of rejoicing, yes, but if you've got any sense
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   it will also tell you that you are that much older than you were a year ago
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and that you've got that much less time to spend in this world, therefore.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And it's the same with an old year like this which is coming to an end,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   this being the last Sunday night of 1965.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's a good opportunity for us, isn't it, to examine ourselves
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and to see where we stand in life.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's a good opportunity for us to do so in the light of this Christian Gospel,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   in the light of yesterday, Christmas, and what it's all about.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And now I want to try to show you that in these two phrases
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   the whole thing, as I say, is in a sense summarized for us.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Now there are many here tonight I know who have been listening to this Gospel
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   throughout the year.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   How have you reacted to it?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   What difference has it made to you?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Has it made any difference?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Does it govern your thinking?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Does it govern your thinking about the end of a year, the beginning of another,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   about the whole of life, death, what lies beyond it?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's what it's for, that's what it's about.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You see, this notion that Christianity is just a message about particular activities
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   in which people indulge is entirely wrong.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   In other words, I'm not going to be preaching tonight about what's happening in Rhodesia
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   or South Africa or America or Russia or anywhere else you like
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   because, you see, that wouldn't be preaching to you.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I'm here to preach to you and here to preach to myself.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And whatever may be happening in those other countries and amongst other people,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   what you and I will be held responsible for is what we have done with our lives
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and with our existence and the time that we have spent in this world.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's what Christianity is about.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It is primarily a very personal message.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And this is the tragedy of the times in which we live,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   that people have forgotten this and dislike this
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and think of Christianity and its message only in some vague, general terms
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   that have nothing to do with their own personal life and living.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   That is why, you see, it's possible for you to have statesmen,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and we've had them so often, haven't we,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   who can talk very eloquently about the sanctity of international contracts
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   but who are not so careful about observing the terms of their own marriage contracts.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's why you get national hypocrisy as well as personal hypocrisy.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Now, I say that the business of this message is to deal with us individually and personally.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   You'll never get a good nation until you get good people in it.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The nation is, in a sense, an abstraction.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It's a collection of individuals.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And you must start always with the individual.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And so we end this old year by looking at the individual.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And here I'm going to hold before you the two focal points, if you like,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   of this great ellipse which constitutes the Christian message,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   the Christian proclamation.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   What is it?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   What's the message of the Bible?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   What's the message of the Gospel?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Well, it's these two things.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The place was shaken.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   The power of God.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The grace of God.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And here, you see, these two things are brought together.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And that's what I want to do as briefly and as hurriedly as I can this evening.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   The first great message in the Bible and in the Gospel is always about the power of God.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   It comes first here.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   It always comes first.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   The Gospel starts with a proclamation about God.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   About the being of God.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   The Gospel doesn't start with us.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It doesn't start with our needs and problems and aches and pains.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Doesn't matter what our condition is here tonight.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Doesn't matter what we felt like when we came in.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   There is one universal message in the Bible to all.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And it starts with the first verse in the Bible.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   In the beginning, God.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The great God.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The almighty God.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   A God who can shake a building.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   The God of power.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   The God of might.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The God who, according to the Bible and according to the Gospel, therefore, because the whole Bible is the whole message of the Gospel.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   He is a God of great and of infinite power.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   He is an omnipotent God.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And he sits upon the circle of the universe.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It starts then with this assertion of the power of God.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Here you see the people met together in the church.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   They've offered up their prayer.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   The first thing that happens is the building shakes.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It actually did.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   This isn't romance, this is the reporting of facts.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It doesn't tell us how the building shook.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It may have been an earth tremor.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   We don't know.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   But what we do know is that God produced it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And buildings can shake.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I've often pointed out to people when preaching in other parts of the country that I remember this very building we're in now shaking one morning.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   When that flying bomb landed over there on the God's chapel, this building shook and that wall on that side was moved an inch and a half out of position.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And it literally trembled.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   This rostrum I'm standing in was trembling.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Well, you see, men have the power to make bombs that can shake a building like this.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And what the Bible tells us is that God is all-powerful.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It starts by asserting the power of God.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And it tells us, of course, how this power has shown itself and manifested itself.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   You get it, of course, supremely in that great act of creation.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Would you know anything about the power of God?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   God said, "Let there be light."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And there was light.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   His word, his fear is enough.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Here is some indication of the power of God.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   The Apostle Paul, you remember, in preaching to the Romans, in sending his letter to the Romans, he makes that very point.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   He says, "That which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse."
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   The powerful God, who exists in eternity, and who decides to create a world, to make a world out of nothing, and thus of just by a word.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   It's incomprehensible, of course.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It's infinite.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   It is the omnipotent God.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Nothing is impossible with God.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And he's given proof of it in creation, in nature, and all the wonder and the magnificence, and all the perfection of creation.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   There you see it.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But then, we've seen it also, and it's described in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   The power of God has manifested in providence and in history.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   We live in an amazing world, a world that was made, as I've told you, out of nothing.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   And then at a given point, God decided that he'd destroy that world because of its sin, because of its evil, because of its rebellion against him.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   When he saw that all the thoughts, the imaginations of the thoughts of men's mind were only evil,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   when he looked down and saw men and women living much as they're living today,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   not only in immorality, but in foul perversions and everything that is almost unmentionable,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   he decided that he would destroy the world.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Well, that second epistle of Peter, chapter 3, that we read at the beginning, reminded us of it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   There was the earth standing in the water and out of the water, and God decided to destroy it.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And he did by a deluge, by a flood.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Same power brings the world into being, can destroy it by a flood, whenever he likes, whenever he chooses.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And then, the flood is made to recede, and God restores order.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And he goes on sustaining, guiding the world.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Oh, there are many descriptions of this in the Old Testament.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Read for yourself sometime the 104th Psalm, and there you'll find the psalmist working it out in detail,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   how God not only made everything, but he keeps it all going.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   He controls it, he gives it breath and life.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   If he were to withdraw the spirit, everything would collapse.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   There are some of the descriptions you have in the Old Testament of this amazing power of God.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And then I say, in Providence, and in history particularly.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   You remember the children of Israel down in Egypt because of a famine.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And there they grew and multiplied, and they did well, and the Egyptians became very jealous of them.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And they began to maltreat them.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   The Pharaoh, he was a great dictator, one of the most powerful men in the then known world.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And he'd got armies, and chariots, and horses, and here are these people, they've got nothing at all.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They were just the children of Israel, the Jews, they've got no armies, no chariots, nothing.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   But they're being victimized.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But they're God's people.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And God acted on their behalf.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   You can read the story in the Old Testament.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   He led them out, and here they are suddenly confronted by the Red Sea.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Armies of Pharaoh behind them, Red Sea in front of them.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Two mountains, one on each side, Piaheroth and Beelzephon.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   What can they do?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   They can do nothing, but God can.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   He suddenly opens the Red Sea, and through they go.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Pharaoh and their hosts trying to follow, the sea shuts upon them, and they're destroyed.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Pharaoh and his hosts, and all his bursted army, vanquished and destroyed.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Same God.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And on the story goes, often recapitulated in many of the great Psalms in the Old Testament collection.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You can read of his dealings with men and with nations, and you'll find this great power of his.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Another dictator arose, a man called Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   He was the dictator of the Babylonians, and he was a mighty man.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   A great soldier and a great statesman.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   But like so many such men, he became inflated.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And began to think that he was a God, and commended people to worship him.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   What an ignorant fool.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   He didn't know the power of the God that dwells in the heavens.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And this God suddenly struck him and smote him.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And he became like an ox.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And there he was in the field with his hair grown like that of an ox.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And he was eating grass, and his nails grew to be great talons.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Nebuchadnezzar, humbled, made a fool of before his own people.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Well, there it is. I'm just giving you a summary of the Old Testament and its history.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And it all is just to tell us that we are under the hands and under the eye of an almighty God.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   The place was shaken.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   The power of God.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   We live in a world that is under his hand.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's his world, made by him, controlled by him, governed by him, everything determined by him.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   You and I are face to face with such a God.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's the first message, you see, of the Gospel.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   It comes as a proclamation that he's a God who is all-powerful.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And, of course, you get the same thing in the New Testament.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   You've been thinking about the babe that was born in Bethlehem in the stable.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And the little body they put there into the manger.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And you read the stories about him in the Gospels.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And what you find is that he was always astonishing people.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Once he sets out in his public ministry especially, he begins to do works, mighty works, miracles, marvels.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are made to hear.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And even the dead are raised again.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Who is this? He can calm the storm, he can silence the raging of the wind.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   He can feed five thousand with but five loaves and two fishes.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Who is this? That was the question they all asked.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   What is this power?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   We have seen great things today, the people said, this demonstration of power.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   What is it? Oh, it's the power of God.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   These are the attestations of his person.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   These are the things that tell us that Jesus of Nazareth, the babe of Bethlehem, is not merely a man.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   He is God come in the flesh.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He is the one by whom and through him all things were created.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   By him all things were made that are made and without him was nothing made that is made.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   God, the almighty creator, and he manifests it in his works of power.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That's why they're recorded for us in the gospels.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   In order that we might realize who he is and what he's come into the world to do.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   But of course, one of the most amazing demonstrations of the power that has ever taken place.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   What was that which took place in his case?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He was taken, you remember, and tried and condemned.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And they took him and they nailed him to a cross.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And he died and they thrust a spear into his side.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And out came a mixture of blood and water.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And they took down his body and they buried it in a grave.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And they were all triumphant and jubilant.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   His enemies thought they'd finished with him and that that was the end.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But they were so terribly wrong.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   The grave was found to be empty on the morning of the third day.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He'd left it. There was nothing left but the grave clothes.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   He'd risen from the dead.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   God had raised him from the dead.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And that is one of the most amazing demonstrations of the power of God.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   That ever has taken place or ever will take place.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Listen to the Apostle Paul describing it at the end of the first chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   He wants the Ephesians to know something of God's power towards them.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And this is how he describes it.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us would that believe.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   According to the working of his mighty power.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Far above all principality and power and might and dominion.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And every name that is named not only in this world.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   But also in that which is to come.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   What does it mean? It means this.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Here is a power that can conquer death.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Here is a power that can conquer the grave.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Here is a power that can conquer the devil and hell.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   The power of the resurrection.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   The power of eternal life.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   The last enemy is death.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's been destroyed by the power of God.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Well here it is.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And then you go on and you read of what happened on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   We read it in the second chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   There they were all met together we are told.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And that morning they had been praying together for ten days.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   These waiting disciples, listen.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   When the day of Pentecost was fully come.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   They were all with one accord in one place.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And suddenly there came a sound from heaven.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   As of a rushing mighty wind.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And it filled all the house where they were sitting.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   A mighty rushing wind.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   There it is the same power.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And here in our story this evening you have another example of the same thing.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Here are these people you see in their terrible desperate straits.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Not knowing what to do nor where to turn.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And they pray to God and the building is shaken.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Power of God.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I must not keep you.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   All these are but adumbrations.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Of a yet mightier manifestation of the power of God.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Which is yet to come.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Now I have already read one description of that to you at the beginning.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   In that second epistle of Peter.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And in the third chapter the day of the Lord shall come.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   The heavens shall be shaken and the elements will melt with a fervent heat.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Have you seen on your television sets.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Some of the pictures of the letting off of some of these atomic bombs.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Have you seen the power lifting up the earth.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Rising into the heavens.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Causing the sea as it were to mount up like a mountain.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   What mighty power there is in that.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   But my dear friend it is nothing.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   By contrast with that which is yet to happen.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   When the end of time shall come.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And the day of the Lord shall come.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And this tremendous cataclysm shall take place.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   What is this?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Well this is God's last judgment.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   When he will demonstrate that he is the governor of the universe.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And the judge of the ends of the earth.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   He has done these things throughout history in order to prepare us.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   He is teaching us.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He is calling us.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   To be ready for this.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And that is why I am addressing you on this subject this evening.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   The authorities are condemning the disciples.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   The apostles telling them to be silent.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   They say we don't want to be silent.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   We want to go on.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Tell us that you are going to enable us.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   God shakes the building.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Go on.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   He says I am with you.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And he is giving a warning to these judges.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   To these councils.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   That a day is coming when they will have to stand before him.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Listen to the author of the epistle to the Hebrews putting this.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   See that he refused not him that speaketh.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   For if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Much more shall not we escape.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   If we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Whose voice then shook the earth.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   He is talking about the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And the mountain did quake.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And any animal or human that touched that mountain died immediately.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Whose voice then shook the earth.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   But now he hath promised saying.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heaven.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And this word yet once more.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Signifyeth the removing of those things that are shaken.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   As of things that are made.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   That those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Wherefore we receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Let us have grace.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   For our God is a consuming fire.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   The place was shaken.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   God speaking.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   God manifesting himself.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   My friends have you heard this God?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Have you heard this God speaking?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   This is the first proclamation of this message.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   That God the almighty is over all.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And we are all under him.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And we hold our lives and our life and our being and our existence.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And everything under his almighty hand.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   The power of God.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   But thank God.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   The message does not stop there.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   It ended there it would be the most terrible message.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Ever heard by a human ear.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   But there is a second element in this message.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   And that is it is a proclamation of the grace of God.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   The place was shaken.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Oh what a wonderful word.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   This word grace.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   That is why we are here tonight.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   That is why there is such a thing as the Christian church.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   That is why these people were praying there.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And assembled in that room that was shaken.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It is because of this grace of God.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Here is the other strand.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   The other great element in this proclamation.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   The power of God yes.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But the grace of God and it is equal to his power.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   What do we mean by grace?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   We mean by grace favor shown to people who are utterly undeserving of it.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And the fact that the world is in existence tonight is due to the grace of God.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   When men sinned against God he deserved immediate annihilation.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   He deserved to be blotted out in this world.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   But he wasn't why?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Oh because God is long-suffering and full of grace and mercy.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And of compassion.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And that is why the world I say is still in being.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Because of this amazing quality, this attribute in God.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Which is described by the word grace.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   It is inadequate of course.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   You can't describe this.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It is something that baffles statement and description.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But you can see it in operation.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And you can see it in the Old Testament very clearly.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   In the case of those children of Israel.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   God had made them for himself a nation.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   He had given them his laws.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And he promised to bless them.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   But they constantly rebelled against him.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   They turned their backs on him.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   They turned to other gods.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   They did everything they could to insult God.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And they deserved retribution.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   They deserved punishment.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   They deserved I say annihilation.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   But they didn't get it.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   What happened so repeatedly is this.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   That having as one of them puts it played the fool.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Having turned their backs on God.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And having gone their own way.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Thinking that was the way of life and happiness and pleasure and joy.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   They come up against some brick wall.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   They knock their heads against it.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And they're miserable and wretched.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   They've lost their everything.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And in their utter desolation and despair.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They turn back to God.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And they ask him to help them.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And the amazing thing is that he listens to them.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And hearkens unto them.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And comes down again as it were to help them.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   That's the measure of his grace.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   That he's prepared to forgive them.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And forgive them.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And to take them back.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And to give them another chance.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   My dear friends.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   That's why I say I'm in this pulpit.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Because of the grace of God.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   If he were only power.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I wouldn't be here.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   None of us would be here.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   There'd be no message.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   It would be the end.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   But God is a God of grace.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   But if you really want to know anything about the grace of God.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Well then.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   You have to go to Bethlehem.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And you have to go to that inn.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   And you have to go out into the stable.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   There was no room in the inn.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   All the rooms were booked.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And there was no room for a pregnant woman.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Nobody had the decency to vacate a room for her.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Not at all.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   It's my room.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I'm all right Jack.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Get on with it.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It's their own business.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   They should have booked.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   So he was born in a stable.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And he was placed in the manger.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   What's that?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Oh that's the grace of God.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   God so loved the world.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   That he gave his only begotten son.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   That whosoever believeth in him should not perish.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   But have everlasting life.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Loved the world remember.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   The world that had rebelled against him and ridiculed him.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Spat into his face.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Thought it knew better than he did.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   God so loved that world that he gave.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Sent his only son into it.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And not merely into the world.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   But above all to the death of the cross.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   To bear the sins of men.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   To endure scoffing rude.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   And shame and ignominy.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And everything that is hurtful.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   That's the grace of God.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Listen to Paul putting it in his epistle to Titus.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   In the second chapter.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   In a magnificent statement.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   For the grace of God that bringeth salvation.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Hath appeared to all men.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   That's it.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   In the coming of his son into the world.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And supremely in his dying on the cross.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   The grace of God.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Though he was so rich.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   For our sakes.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He became poor.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And oh how poor.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Though he was God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And counted it not robbery to be equal with God.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   He humbled himself.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And made himself of no reputation.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   What for?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   That you and I might be delivered and redeemed.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And restored to God.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   That's grace.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   It is all from God's side.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   None from ours.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   We deserve nothing but punishment and hell.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   But because of the grace of God.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   There is this amazing gospel.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And it's offered to us as we listen to it again.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   This last Sunday night of this old year 1965.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Well now there are the two strands you see.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   But let me show you how one of our poets Isaac Watts.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Has put these two things before us in a most wonderful hymn.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Now to the Lord a noble song.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Awake my soul.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Awake my tongue.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Hosanna to the eternal name.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And all his boundless love proclaim.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Listen.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   See where it shines in Jesus face.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   The brightest image of his grace.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   God in the person of his son.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Has all his mightiest works out done.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Then he argues it out.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   He starts you see.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   As I've been doing with the power in creation.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   The spacious earth and spreading flood.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Proclaim the wise and powerful God.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And thy rich glories from afar.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Sparkle in every rolling star.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   But in his looks.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   A glory stands.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   The noblest labor of thy hands.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   The radiant luster of his eyes.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Out shines the wonders of the skies.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   The power of God.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Seen in the skies and the rolling stars.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   But look at the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And he says.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   The radiant luster of his eyes.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Out shines the wonders of the skies.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Grace.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Is a sweet a charming theme.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   My thoughts rejoice at Jesus name.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Ye angels dwell upon the sound.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Ye heavens reflected to the ground.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   There it is isn't it.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   The power of God.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   The grace of God.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   But my dear friends.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Here's the thing I really want to say to you.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   The gospel proclaims the power of God.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   The gospel proclaims the grace of God.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   But the most wonderful thing of all.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   That it proclaims is this.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   The gospel proclaims the powerful grace of God.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   It brings them together.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And you know if it didn't do that.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I'd have no message to give you tonight.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Before you and I or anybody else can be saved.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We need power and grace.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And the two must operate together.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And in Christ they do.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Powerful grace.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Here's the paradox of Christianity.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Men doesn't understand this.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   You see the apostle Paul writing to Timothy says.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   God hath not given us the spirit of fear.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   But of power and of love.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Power and love of course.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   The world thinks they're opposites and antitheses.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And they are to the world and it's little thinking.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   But not with God.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   God hath not given us the spirit of fear.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   But of power and of love.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And of discipline sound mind.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Power and love.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Power and grace.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   They become one.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   They operate together.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And in Christ you see this to all perfection.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And I'm here just to remind you.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   That this is what makes the miracle of redemption possible.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   That God combines his power and his grace.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   In his dealings with us.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Why is this necessary?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Well you see.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Grace alone couldn't save us.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It needs power.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   So God combines the power with the grace.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Why does it need so much power?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I'll tell you why it needs the power.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   No man can ever be saved or redeemed.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Unless if he is first of all quickened from the dead.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You remember Paul in Ephesians 2.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   First verse.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   You which he quickened were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   My dear friends.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Every one of us born into this world is spiritually dead.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   That's why the world doesn't believe in the babe of Bethlehem tonight.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Because it's dead.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   The world is so dead that it doesn't know that it's dead.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   That's it's whole trouble.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   It is spiritually dead.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   It doesn't know God.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   It doesn't know the truth about him.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   It doesn't realize it's living in the universe.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   I've been privileged to describe to you.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   It doesn't know anything about the coming judgment.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   The world is dead.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   The dead can do nothing.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   They know nothing.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   And that is the condition of all of us by nature.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   That's the result of the fall.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   You which he quickened were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Before any man can be saved and become a Christian.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   You need a power that is greater than death.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   You need a resurrecting power.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   And it's all there in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Powerful grace.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   He's able to quicken by his Holy Spirit.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   We need to be quickened.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   We need to be raised out of the death of sin.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   All the power is essential.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And then another need of the power is seen in this way.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And perhaps this is one of the greatest needs in the world tonight.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   That the world needs to be shaken.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Shaken out of its complacency.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Shaken out of its carelessness.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Shaken out of its sense of safety.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Isn't that the real curse of this country of ours at the present time?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Doesn't it account for most of our problems?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   It certainly accounts for the godlessness.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And the vice and the increasing immorality.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Affluent society.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Never had it so good.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Plenty of money, plenty of everything.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Record Christmas.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   More money spent than ever on food, drink, presents, pleasures of all descriptions.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Ah, everything's alright.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   We needn't think about gospel.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   We don't want preaching.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   We don't want Christianity.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   We've made a perfect world ourselves.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Everything is alright.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   The complacency of the modern men, the modern world.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   The carelessness, the heedlessness.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   The sense of safety and the sense of security.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Oh, the tragedy of men and women living on a volcano and unaware of it.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   The world needs to know tonight about the god who can shake.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   The building, the place was shaken where they were assembled together.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Just a touch of his power to let them know that he's there and he's almighty.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And we all had to be shaken out of our complacency and out of our indifference.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Come, my dear friend.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   You may be in a place of worship for the first time in your life or the first time for many years.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   You've turned in because it's the Sunday after Christmas or the last Sunday of an old year.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Shall I ask you a simple question?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   How often have you thought about your soul?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   How often have you thought about your death?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   How often have you visualized yourself standing before God at the eternal bar of judgment?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   How often have you done it?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I say to you that you need to be reminded that you stand before a God who is all-powerful.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   An almighty God who is the judge of the ends of the earth.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   We need to be shaken out of our complacency, our thoughtlessness, and our carelessness.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And he does it.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He does it by the grace which he has shown in his son through the gospel.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And we need the power that can convict us of sin.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   No argument or demonstration can do it.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I try my best.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   You say, "Oh, that's just what he thinks."
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And you dismiss it.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   There's only one thing that can ever convict a man of sin.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It is the power of the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Nothing else.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   But he can do it.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And he does do it.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   He did it on the day of Pentecost.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Peter was preaching, expounding scriptures, taking Old Testament passages, stringing them together.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   You say, "What a poor sermon.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   No eloquence, no art."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I know, but it was filled with the Spirit.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   And as he was preaching, we read, "They were pricked in their hearts."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And they cried out, saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   The power of conviction.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   You read the stories of the great revivals of history.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   You'll see men not only convicted of sin, but you'll see them falling to the floor.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   You'll see them staggering home in agony, not able to sleep, in trouble for weeks.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   The power of conviction produced by the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   This power that shakes and disturbs and demolishes all that we've relied upon.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And then, oh, this is the power that's needed before we can be put right.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   We need to be created anew.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   What our Lord said is, "You must be born again."
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   You don't want just a new idea.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   New teaching is not enough for you.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   You don't want just an example.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   You must be born again.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   You must be created anew.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And there's only one power that can do that.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It is the power of God.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Good advice, nice little talk about Christmas, pretty Christmas cards.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Sentimentalizing about the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   It's never saved anybody and never will.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Before a man can be saved, he must be born again.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   We need a new nature, a new life, a new orientation, a new everything.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   The power and the grace of God combined can do it for us.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   It alone can do so.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And then we need to be delivered from the power of Satan.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   The world, the flesh, the devil, oh, what a power.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Have you been able to stand up against it?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Can you stand up against the jeering and the mockery and the insinuations
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   of your friends in the same office or the factory or the profession?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Can you stand up to the ridicule and the scorn?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   The world, the flesh, the devil, oh, what a power.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   The suggestion of the television and the newspapers, all against all this.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Can you stand up? Have you stood up?
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   There is only one power that can beat and defeat the power of Satan and sin and evil.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   It is the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   God's power and God's grace combined in this one blessed person.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And he alone can deliver us from these enemies that are set against us.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   And then think of the work of perfecting us.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Getting rid of the evil and the sin that is in us.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Purifying us and cleansing us and making us fit to stand in his holy presence.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   There is only one power that can do it.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   And Paul mentions it at the end of the third chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Now he says unto him that he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Unto him be glory in the church through Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   And finally the power that is needed and will be needed in the case of every one of us
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   when we die and are buried and our bodies are placed in a grave or cremated or drowned in the sea
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   or blown to nothing in the air, it doesn't matter which.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   The power to reassemble, to raise the body and glorify it and make it perfect
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   and put it to stand in the presence of God.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   There is only one power that can do that, it's the power of God.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And the power of God combined with the grace of God purposes to do this.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   It's done it for myriads who are in the glory at this moment.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   It is doing it for us who believe.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   That's the message of the gospel.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Power of God, grace of God, powerful grace of God.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Very well for me to close.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   You see this message divides mankind, doesn't it?
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   It did it there at the beginning.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   The Sanhedrin hated this message.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   It hated Christ and crucified him.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   It hates his disciples, apostles and it arrests them
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   and it condemns them and threatens to put them to death.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   That's one reaction.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   But there's another reaction you see and it is this great grace was upon them all.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Oh, what a contrast.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And that's the thing that I want to leave with you
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   as a great and most momentous question this evening.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   We are all of us in one of these two positions and there is no third.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   There are some people who will only know the power of God.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   All they will know is the shaking, the shaking power of God yet once more.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   I shake not the earth but also the heavens.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   There are men and women, oh God forbid that there should be any such in this congregation,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   who will know nothing but the power of God to shake.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And when they stand before him, they'll shake to nothing.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   They're like the men described, you remember, in the first psalm.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   The ungodly, we are told, cannot stand in the presence of God in the day of judgment.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Listen to this.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   They will be swept away.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   which the wind drives away.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   The shaking and the consigning to eternal perdition.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   What a terrible prospect, what an awful thought.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   But that is the fate of all who don't believe this gospel.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   That is the fate of all who turn a deaf ear to the overtures of the grace of God,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   the powerful grace of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   They'll see nothing but the power, the demonstration of the might,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   the awfulness of the final calamity when it's too late.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   But there are others, thank God, who know great grace,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   great grace was upon them all.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Isn't this an amazing thing?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Here's a collection of Christian people, threatened by the authorities,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   with terrible consequences, threatened even with death.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   But this is what I read about them.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   What's it mean?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Well, it means this.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   The favor of God was upon them in a mighty and in an unusual manner.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   You see, that is why God shook the building.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   It was God's way of speaking to these people and saying to them,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   it's all right, don't be troubled.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   You've heard their threatenings.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   You've reminded me of them.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   They've got their powers and they have it in their power to put you to death
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   if they want to and if they choose to.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   But it's all right.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   I am with you.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Don't be frightened of them, says God.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   I'm with you.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   You know me.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   You've described my power to me.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   You've reminded me that I am the creator.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   It's all right.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   I am with you.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   I'm behind you.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I love you.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   You're my people.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I will never leave you.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   I'll never forsake you.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Hold on, it's all right.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Though they're threatened,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   they're filled with this wonderful spirit of rejoicing and of praise,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   of love to one another and love to God.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   What is it?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Would you like to know in which of the two positions you are tonight?
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   You answer it by answering this question.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Is great grace upon you?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Do you know something of this great grace?
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   How can I know it, says someone?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Well, you know, I must tell you this, this last Sunday night.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   God forbid anybody should end this year without being quite clear about this.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Do you know what God has done for you?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Do you know that God so loved you
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   that he sent his only begotten son to the death of that cross for you?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Do you know that your sins are forgiven?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Do you know tonight, and what a wonderful thought it is,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   at the end of the year, that your past is entirely forgiven?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Oh, the past.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   You can't erase it, none of us can.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   But do you believe tonight that God has erased it out of the books?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   That he's put all your sins upon his son
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   and dealt with them and punished them there on the cross on Calvary's Hill?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Can you say from your heart tonight, the past has been forgotten?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Do you know that your sins have been blotted out as a thick cloud?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   The man who's got grace upon him knows this.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   He knows that his sins have been laid upon Christ
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   and punished in him and that he's free.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   He doesn't worry about his past.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   He knows that it is cleared and that it is cleansed
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   because God in his infinite all-powerful grace
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   has laid them all upon one who could take the punishment
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   and still rise from the dead.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Do you know that? That's the past.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   What about the present?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Are you resting in him?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Have you got life in you, life, the life of Christ?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Have you got rid of the restlessness that is so characteristic of the world?
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Have you found peace?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Have you found satisfaction?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Look at these people.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   I remind you again of them.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   They've left the courtroom.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   They've been straightly charged and threatened
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   that if they go on speaking and teaching in the name of this Jesus,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   they're going to be put to death.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   They go back and report it and they all with one accord begin to pray.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Here's the result.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   It means this.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   In spite of the threatenings, in spite of everything,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   they've never been so happy in the whole of their lives.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   When all things seem against me to drive me to despair,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I know one gate is open.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   One ear will hear my prayer.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Listen to Paul putting it to the Romans.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   He says that because of our justification by faith,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   by whom also we have access into this grace
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Listen.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And not only so,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   but we glory, rejoice, make our burst in tribulations also.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Knowing the tribulation worketh patience and patience experience,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   My friend, are you able to rejoice in tribulations?
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Are you happy in spite of the world?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Have you got a final contentment within you?
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Are you independent of the world and all its noise and bustle
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   and its empty show and all that may happen in it?
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Have you got a place of rest and peace and quiet,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   a calm undisturbed joy that the world can neither give nor take away?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   If you have it, great grace is upon you.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And it's the grace of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   That's the present.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   What of the future?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Well, you see these people, here they are.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   They're threatened, and they've met together a little company.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Oh, but they're full of rejoicing and of praise.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Great grace is upon them.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Why?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Well, because they've got complete assurance with respect to the future.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   When great grace is upon you, you're not only not afraid of life,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   you're not afraid of death.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   You're afraid of nothing.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   You're like the Apostle Paul.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   There he is in prison.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   He writes one of his last letters.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   He says, "For the sake of which things also I suffer these things.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   against that day."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   Do you know anything about that as you face the future?
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   This year that's coming, 1966, if we live to see it.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Are you afraid of it?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Are you filled with terror and alarm?
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   And as you look forward and contemplate the end of life
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   and your own dissolution out of this mortal frame,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   how do you react to it?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Can you look steadily in its face?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   What if war comes, persecution, bombs?
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   How does it find you?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Here are the questions that matter.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Listen to Paul's answer.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   Nay, in all these things we are more than conqueror through him that loved us.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   nor things present, nor things to come,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Can you say that?
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   If you can, I can assure you great grace is upon you,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   the powerful grace of God.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   You know that you are his,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   and that nothing can ever separate you from his love,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and you are therefore more than conquerors
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   against any possible conceivable eventuality.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Very well then, shall I test you
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   by asking if you can say something like this,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   "All the way my Saviour leads me,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   what am I to ask beside?
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Can I doubt his tender mercy
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   who through life has been my guide?
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   hereby faith in him to dwell,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   for I know what e'er befall me,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Jesus doeth all things well."
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Do you know that?
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Were you able to sing that hymn just now?
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   With honesty and with truth,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   did it come from your hearts?
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   In heavenly love abiding,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   no change my heart shall fear,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   for unsafe is such confiding,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   for nothing changes here.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   The storm may roar without me,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   my heart may low be laid,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   but he, God, is round about me,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   and can I be dismayed,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   wherever he may guide me?
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   No one shall turn me back,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   my shepherd is beside me,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   and nothing can I lack,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   his wisdom never waketh,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   his sight is never dim,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   he knows the way he taketh,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   and I will walk with him.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Green pastures are before me,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   which yet I have not seen,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   bright skies will soon be o'er me,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   where the dark clouds have been.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   My hope I cannot measure,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   my path to life is free,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   my Saviour has my treasure,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   and he will walk with me.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   I quoted this morning,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   out of that great hymn of Augustus Toplady,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   and I quote it again.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Here he is facing the future,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   and this is what he says,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   I shall behold his face,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   notice the two things now,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   I shall behold his face,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   I shall his power adore,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   and sing the wonders of his grace,
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   forevermore.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   He's going to adore his power,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   and sing the wonders of his grace.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   The place was shaken,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   great grace was upon them all.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   To the believer,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   the power is a gracious power,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   it's the power that saves him,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   that keeps him,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   that protects him,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   and eventually will put him
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   in the glory everlasting.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   My dear friend,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   the old year is dying,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   and life is moving on.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   I am privileged and glad
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   to be able to tell you this evening,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   that the day of grace is not yet ended.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   Today is the day of salvation.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   There will be an end to the day of grace,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   but not yet, thank God,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   it is still the day of grace.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Now is the accepted time,
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   the door of mercy is not yet shut,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   it will be,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   remember the ten virgins,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   the five wise,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   and the five foolish,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   the gate, the door will be shut,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   but not yet,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   it's not too late.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   Today thy mercy calls me
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   to wash away my sin,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   however great my trespass,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   whatever I have been,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   however long from mercy
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   I may have turned away,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   thy love, O Christ,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   thy blood, O Christ,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   can cleanse me,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   and make me white today.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Today thy gate is open,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   and all who enter in
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   shall find the Father's welcome,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   and cleansing from their sin,
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   the past shall be forgotten,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   a present joy be given,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   a future grace be promised,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   a glorious crown in heaven.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   The day of grace is not ended.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   There is still the possibility.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   How does one receive
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   this great grace?
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   The answer is here.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   All them that believed
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   were of one heart.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   That is all you have to do,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   to believe this message
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   about God,
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   the all-powerful,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   the almighty,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   the omnipotent,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   the judge before whom
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   you'll have to stand.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   Believe that,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   and then believe the message
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   concerning the grace of God
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   in Jesus Christ his Son.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   Believe the message,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   and you will soon experience
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   its power,
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   the powerful grace of God
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   that will give you satisfaction
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   about your past,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   that will give you
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   true contentment in the present,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   that will take away from you
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   the fear of the future,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   and fill you with the anticipated
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   joy of heaven,
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   the vision of God,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   and everlasting bliss.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   The place was shaken.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   Great grace was upon them all.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Have you entered through the door,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   the gate of grace?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   I tell you once more,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   it is still open.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   Only believe,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   and thou shalt see
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   that Christ is all in all
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   to thee.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   Do it now,
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   if you've never done it before.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   Cry out unto him.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   Thank him for this grace,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   for this open door
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   that is still there.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Thank him for the invitation,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   and say,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   "Just as I am without one plea,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   "but that thy blood was shed for me
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   "and that thou bidst me come to thee,
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   "O Lamb of God,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   "I come."
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Amen.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   We do hope that you've been helped
