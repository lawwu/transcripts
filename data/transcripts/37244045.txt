[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   Well, hi, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Everyday Educator. Today I have
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.160]   someone very special in, she's not in the studio, but on the show with me, Babs from
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.420]   the MathMap team. And we were just talking about the fact that I'm really excited she's
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.060]   here because she and I both don't consider ourselves to be math experts, but we're about
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.740]   to have a whole conversation with you about math and what we can do with our children
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.640]   over the summer to encourage them in their mathematic exploration. And I think while it's
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.760]   great to hear from the experts, it's also really great to hear from just normal moms, just like
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.600]   you who are in the thick of it, trying to figure it out and doing their best and also to learn
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.200]   what has been successful in the past. So without any further ado, Babs, welcome to the show.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.780]   Thank you. Thank you for having me. I'm excited.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.020]   I'm excited too. This is going to be fun. So for people who don't know you, maybe haven't
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.560]   heard any episodes with you, can you just introduce yourself, your context and kind of your homeschooling
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.000]   background?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So a couple of years ago, I think it was probably six or seven years ago, I was asked to go to
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.740]   some kind of introduction to math. Actually, they were piloting a curriculum. I don't think
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.780]   I was told it was math. And so I was like, Oh, sure, I'll be in the pilot. And when I got there,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.180]   I found out it was math. So I was like, Oh, man, I'm gonna pilot a math curriculum. And so I was a
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.960]   little nervous. But what I found out is that I am a math person. And I think the language that we use
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.720]   is, yes, we're not a math expert. But I can be an anything person, I can be a Latin person, I can be
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.020]   a math person, I just have to want to do it. And I have to, you know, rely on the Holy Spirit, right to
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.000]   help and really just encourage me as I keep going. Bring things to light. I remember asking lots of
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.180]   times for the help of the Holy Spirit, as I was working through some things. And so, so fast forward,
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.620]   so I got to work on the math map pilot for a couple of years. And then I became a curriculum assistant
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.020]   with the math map. So for somebody who did not make A's and B's in math and high school or college,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.100]   magically, I get to work on the math map team. And I always I say that I've said this over and over
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   again, I've learned more in the last six years than I ever learned when I was in school. And it's really
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.140]   obviously, when you're an adult, right, you want to learn more than when you're a kid. But I think just
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.260]   learning the classical using the classical tools has really helped me make it approachable. And I can learn
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.940]   it, I now get to be invited into the conversation, whereas I don't necessarily know that I was invited into the
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.700]   conversation before. And so it kind of, you know, just kind of brings that brings that to light.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.020]   I've been homeschooling, I feel like forever, I just graduated one son last year, and I have a senior
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.060]   upcoming this year. So I'm kind of towards the end of that journey. So it's a different place to be.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.540]   But it's a good time of reflection. And I think to kind of pour into other moms, to show them, hey,
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.220]   you're not gonna mess your kid up. Right? My kid is great. He went to community college. And apparently,
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.060]   they think he's the smartest thing ever. And I think it's because a lot of those kids don't know how to
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.460]   write papers. And that's a lot of what we did in CC was write a lot of papers, give a lot of speeches.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.140]   And so I guess it's just, it's a good time now to just pour into other moms and show them that we
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.460]   can do it, that we have the capacity to do it, especially with the Lord's help, and with the
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.940]   help of our community, you know, that we can be successful. So I love that. You said a couple of
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.100]   things, honestly, Babs, that I'd love for you to expand on, even before we get into this specific
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.700]   math conversation. Two things. One, you said, you know, I don't think I'd ever been invited into the
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.940]   conversation. And I think that idea of, of a way of educating where you're inviting your students into
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:29.300]   the conversation is groundbreaking. I mean, that is a completely different way to look at educating.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.540]   Will you speak to that? And then also the fact that you invited the Holy Spirit into the
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.140]   conversation? Because it's kind of like you're having this two way conversation, right?
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:48.260]   I think, you know, I guess because I felt like I wasn't a good calculator, you know, I wasn't a fast
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.540]   calculator. I didn't always understand a lot of the big picture ideas in, even in geometry and algebra.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.300]   So I felt like I wasn't invited into that conversation to keep learning. And I feel like
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.380]   that's what CC has done for me is, hey, we want to invite you in the conversation. We don't care about
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.060]   your math background. We don't care if you ever took an advanced math class. We want to invite all
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.060]   parents into the conversation. Because if we're invited in, now we can invite our student, right?
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.900]   And so there are students that feel like, I just can't do this math. You can, right? You can. And so
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.860]   we want to model to our students, I can do it. And how old am I? 49. And I can do it. So you at 16,
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.460]   15, 14, whatever age they are, they can do it too. So the Holy Spirit thing, I just have to share this
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.220]   with you. So we will probably talk about this a little bit with a different topic. But so
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.380]   this past semester, I took a class through Southeastern, the master's program. And I was
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.940]   trying to decide, you know, what major I wanted. And so I was just playing around with different classes.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:07.540]   So I took elementary number theory. There's nothing elementary about it. Okay. It was very hard. It
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:17.220]   was very hard. And what I found myself doing was crying a lot and also praying a lot. Like I would get
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.100]   to a topic and I just wouldn't understand it. And I would, I would pray, Lord, I know you can help me do
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.460]   this. I know you can help me at least understand enough, you know, to get the gist of this problem,
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.780]   to complete this assignment. And a lot of times it would take me leaving, you know, like walking away,
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.120]   you know, how we get to that breaking point sometimes, and we just have to take a break.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:47.380]   And then coming back to it, you know, after spending some time with the Lord. And eventually I would get
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.980]   it. Now it might take me a day or two, or maybe even a week, but I would eventually get it.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.160]   And so I feel like if I can take a master's level math class with the help of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.820]   then I can do anything now. I mean, it really was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.740]   I know that sounds silly, but it really was one of the hardest things I've ever done
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.320]   because I, I couldn't see the end result. Like I didn't know, well, at the end of this,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.300]   I can write a paper, right? I couldn't see that. It was just, I was understanding this number theory.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.020]   So definitely inviting the Holy Spirit. I have to do that all day long. You know, even if you go to
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.620]   Walmart, you should invite the Holy Spirit to come with you. But for sure, when you're teaching your
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.060]   kids, because not only can the Holy Spirit stir in you and give you the right word to say, but now they
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.500]   can stir in the heart of your child, you know, as you're, you're teaching them as well. So.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.340]   It's so true. I love that you shared that story. Um, something else that we mentioned before we
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:59.360]   press record, you guys is just the fact that I also was a person who, who just had the way I think of
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.760]   it. And I'm not sure if this is actually the truth, but this is where we landed is that I had some
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:11.060]   neurological blocks. Like there were just things in my brain, the figurative speech about math where I,
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:17.540]   I just had a block and I needed the time. Like I actually needed my brain to grow and shift and
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:26.240]   change so that I could wrap my mind around certain concepts when it came to math. And because I was
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.780]   homeschooled through high school and had the benefit of not being the guinea pig child, my mother
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.900]   recognized that fairly quickly. So when I was between the ages of like 13 and 15, she said,
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.600]   you know what? We've done algebra too, so many times, you know, geometry was nothing for me. I
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   could have done it in my sleep. I still can tell you, yes, that wall is about this, this big. And
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.520]   it's this shape. I just, that's how my brain worked. But when it came time to make it figurative,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   I couldn't get there for a long time. And then when I went to college, I needed to get there for the
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:01.920]   major that I had. And so I was like you begging the Lord to enlighten me. And the thing that I want
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.120]   everyone to hear in both of our stories is that he did, you know, like it's, it's not as though math
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   is this topic where you can't invite him in. So while we have this conversation about math and I know
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.400]   everyone tends to have mixed feelings, um, let's teach our kids to do that, to, to really have that
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.620]   conversation with the Lord. Because if we really do believe that the purpose of education is to know
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.420]   God and to make him known, then he should be in the conversation.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:36.620]   Yes. And that's, that's something too, to, you know, a lot of people are like, why do I even care?
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.000]   Like, why do I, why should I make my kid like study all these things? And there's a couple of reasons,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.860]   but you kind of hit on one of them is I can learn more about God by studying math. And it's probably
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:54.300]   things that I'm not going to discover anywhere else. You know, like if you think about like Fibonacci
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:02.960]   numbers, okay, God created this pattern that he put in a sunflower or a shell or a pine cone
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:12.680]   for, for my enjoyment, right? For me to love it and to see its beauty. And so if I don't study and know
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:19.360]   that the, the, the way that was created was by God's math pattern, why I can learn one more thing about
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.260]   the Lord by studying that particular topic. So that's one thing is that we can learn more about
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.700]   the Lord by studying this math topic. And another thing too, is how to do hard things.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:38.940]   Yeah. I mean, we all know in CC, we're training our kids to do hard things. Right. And so I feel like,
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:46.340]   you know, it's really training your brain to think logically, to, to look for patterns. I mean,
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.740]   we can take a lot of the skills that we're learning in mathematics and apply them to so many other
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:57.580]   things that it's just, you're just transferring that skill to math. And so I honestly don't feel
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:06.480]   like you have to love math in order to want your student to succeed in it or want them to, to know
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.580]   about it. I mean, it would probably be helpful for them to see joy while you're teaching them,
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:18.440]   but also it might be good for them to see you're, you're doing hard things. Like my boys watching me
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.100]   cry and struggle and pray to get through this class. I mean, as embarrassing as that probably was
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.920]   for me, I'm glad they saw it because I didn't give up. I didn't not take, you know, I did not finish the
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.100]   class. I actually got an A in it. Hey, you know what I mean? So the fact that they get to see that and
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.320]   we're modeling that for our students, that's just another skill like showing them, Hey, I can do hard
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.360]   things. I can look at something that maybe right might seem really difficult, but breaking it down,
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.420]   looking at the grammar, looking at patterns, it's approachable. So I think that's another thing too,
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:58.120]   is, um, you know, there are lots of reasons to do math. Not, not just that I'm going to be a good
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:04.560]   calculator. I mean, we have computers to calculate, right? And so, you know, yes, it's, it's important
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.500]   for me to know how to, to add a subtract and multiply and divide. It's definitely important. I mean, I need
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.000]   to know if this person gives me back change, did she give me back the right change? Exactly. And I don't
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.080]   have time to pull out my calculator to figure that out. If something's on sale, right? I need to know if
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.240]   they're going to ring it up correctly, right? Cause I can figure out percentages. So there's lots of
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.920]   reasons why we need to know those kinds of things. Um, but more importantly, I think is,
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.380]   can we do hard things and what can I learn about God by studying something that I've never studied
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:42.500]   this deep before? Yeah. And that starts, you know, I love that you and I are having this conversation
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.340]   because your boys are a lot older. I've got one in utero and one who's three, you know, so I'm like
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:56.020]   on the opposite end of the spectrum. Um, but that, that literally starts from a young age,
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.000]   you know, when your children are older, you can explain to them the value of doing something
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.720]   difficult when they are younger. It's more along the lines of modeling, but there are some really
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:12.980]   practical things that regardless of the age of your student, they're going to glean from focusing on
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:19.680]   math. And, and some of that is for, for my son, it's like, Hey, I really want you to write these
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.720]   numbers because we're working on your fine motor skills. And I know what that's going to do for your
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:33.200]   brain. So if you are resistant to, and he's not, he loves to draw, but if, and when he was resistant
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.460]   to writing, I knew it was because he was struggling with a fine motor. So there were a lot of things that
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.780]   we did exercises that we did games that we play, just stuff. I had him pick up all over the place
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.920]   to strengthen those little fingers so that when it came time to do the math, that wasn't a hurdle for
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:54.060]   him. Same thing with like practicing sitting still that might seem so, so unrelated to math, but that
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.240]   patience of doing hard things, that's a skill that you're building your child over time. And if they
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.720]   don't have that tolerance to be able to wade through and just sit there when they're not interested
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.580]   because they don't understand yet, then they can't get that light bulb moment. But those are,
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:15.180]   that's a character conversation we're having right now. So yeah. And it's, it starts young. So I just
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:22.140]   love that we, I'm seeing what you're seeing from a totally different angle, but the value is the same.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:28.920]   So I'm sure that there are people listening who are like, okay, I love what you're saying. Give me some
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:36.420]   practicals. So let's switch gears for just a few minutes and maybe talk about some of your,
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.500]   your top math activity ideas specifically for children in the summer.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:50.400]   So I think first I would make sure I've taken a break, right? Whenever we're done with community
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.760]   or whatever we're doing with school, make sure I at least take a week or two and take a break
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   because we do need the break as moms. We need the break and as kids, they need the break too.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:08.520]   Right. So making sure we, we have a break. Um, and for, for a lot of our families who are getting
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.900]   ready to use the math map, which is brand new, um, there are lots of things to do in the summer
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:20.200]   that can get them ready. And one of them as a parent is to download, there's a naturals booklet.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:26.340]   It's for like ages four and five, no five and six. And it's mostly, mostly copy and trace,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:33.320]   but for the parent, it gives them an introduction into this brand new curriculum and they can just
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.460]   copy and trace at their will. So what I've been trying to do is print out a booklet, stick it in
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.340]   my giant pocketbook that I carry everywhere. And if I go to like the doctor's office and I have to wait,
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.580]   instead of scrolling my phone, which I want to do, I put it up and I try to get out my booklet and just
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.740]   copy and trace. And what that does is it, it gives me an overview of the curriculum, but it also
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:01.640]   gives me, it introduces me to some grammar that either I don't remember from school or I've never
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.660]   seen before because I didn't take that particular higher level math. And so that's one thing that
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.180]   parents can do. And then if their kids are old enough, they can have their kids join and do the
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:17.840]   same thing with them because again, it's copying and tracing. So there's not a lot of brain power that has
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.000]   to go through if I'm just tracing a definition or I'm, you know, copying a symbol. Um, but it's
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.620]   still, I still have the connection. Right. And so I would just, you know, copying and tracing is just a
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:37.160]   good, a good thing to try. Also flashcards. I love flashcards. Um, not necessarily just the CC ones,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.540]   but like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division to always keep those things, you know,
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.800]   going on in my mind. But the new notations flashcards, I love them because it's all those
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.440]   symbols that I don't remember from school. Now they're brought up again in a flashcard way. And if
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.380]   I don't really like the sitting and drilling, I could like hide them around the room and let them go find
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.280]   them. And as they brought them back to me, they could tell me, you know, what the definition was of
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.620]   whatever the symbol was, you know, you can find little ways to play with them and not necessarily
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   have to be, um, you know, just drilling. But so, so that's another thing. And then any games,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.560]   any game that you have in your game closet, you can make it mathematical. So I went through the game
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.060]   closet a while back and I have a hard time getting rid of games. You know, my kids are older, so they
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.420]   probably aren't going to play hi-ho cheerio, but I still have that game. And, and that game can be
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:38.040]   mathematical because I have to count how many of those little red cherries to put on my, my little
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.560]   board. And so like battleship, they have to know coordinates, right? Because they have to put those
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.520]   on there. So probably any game you have in your closet, you could figure out a way to make it
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.300]   mathematical and your kids don't even realize they're learning or reviewing anything. They're just
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:01.100]   playing a game. And so I like to do stuff like that, that really tells them, like, they don't think
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.600]   they're learning, but they are. And we get to play a game because I love games. I love card games. I love
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.620]   board games. And so if I can get all of my folks at one table, I'm going to get them to play a game.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:20.020]   Yeah. And then a bonus if they're, if they're learning something, right? Exactly. Oh, I love those ideas.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.920]   And I mean, it's, it's so true that I had never thought of that. The fact that most,
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.740]   I can't think of an exception at this time, pretty much every board game or card game that you can
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:37.020]   play can be. That's the easiest. I mean, even, even just like that's number recognition, really. It's
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.180]   like numbers and colors, right? But like checkers, that's like logic. Cause you got to, well, and kind
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:49.420]   of numbers too, because you have to have so many in a row, but like almost every game is either, you know,
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:55.400]   you're practicing logic or you're practicing numbers. And then like reading books, you know, we always want
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.120]   to read to our kids. That's really big for us. But there are books at the library about math stuff. Like there
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.960]   was this one book. See if I can remember. It was something like, how does a dinosaur count to 10? It was like
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.900]   over and over again, like little things like that. You could just go to the library and just pick out
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.020]   random books about math. But you're, you're reading to your kids. They're hearing the numbers, you know,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.960]   what was the other one? There was another one about counting. It might've been a Dr. Seuss. Oh,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.060]   you know, like the, he was counting all the weird things in the Dr. Seuss.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:33.280]   Apples up on top is another one. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, those kinds of, and see,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.960]   that's still, you know, reading, right? So you're, you're doing two things at one time. You're reading
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.480]   to your kids or having them read it, but then you're also looking at a math concept. So that's
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.500]   something else you can kind of do in the summer too, is, is reading different math. Yeah, that's
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.320]   great. Well, and what you're making me think of too, Babs, is just the fact that sometimes
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:59.900]   expanding a child's ability to see the application of math is a fantastic use of your time. Like I'll
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.840]   take one just right off the top. Although I'm sure there are many more. I love the story of hidden
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   figures. I find it so inspiring to me. I, and I would have told you in high school and into my early
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.780]   twenties. Now I'm in my thirties that I didn't care about math. That's what I would have told you.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:22.000]   But when I learned what these ladies were able to do with their math skills, I said,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.560]   hang on a second. Actually, I think I want to learn Euler's method. And actually I think I'm very
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:34.320]   interested in the way, you know, my father's an engineer. And so I had, I'd always have kind of
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.620]   a concept of what you could do if you did love math with your mathematical knowledge. However,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:46.520]   sometimes I think people just need to be, they need to be exposed to a new way that math is,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.800]   is kind of hitting them in the face in their daily life, you know, or people who they might
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:57.980]   not expect to be thinking in a mathematical way so that then they, it'll wet their palate and they'll
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:04.060]   say, okay, well, I do want to know these facts because if I can, if I can get ABC, I can get to D and I
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:11.400]   really want to be in this D range. So I'll just, I'll just plow through. So I love what you're saying
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.060]   about that too.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.000]   And cooking, like cooking is the easiest one, right? Because you have to know your measurements.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.300]   And I remember there was a foundation song. I'm probably going to mess it up, but it was like
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.660]   eight blue, an ounce equal one cup, you know, all the ones where you're, it's the measurements.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:31.680]   So I remember in the kitchen cooking and singing that song to try to remember how many ounces were
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.560]   in a cup or whatever. And we would be in the grocery store and we would have to get like hot dogs and
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.920]   hamburgers for, or maybe hot dogs and buns for like some kind of church event. And I would have
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.720]   to count by twelves, like for the buns, how many buns do I need? So I'd get out the 12 song, 12,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:53.120]   24, 30, 30, 40, and sing that. So, I mean, those kinds of things, you don't even know you're doing
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:59.320]   it. You're just doing it, you know? So, I mean, yeah, math is like all around us and, and just living.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.680]   I mean, if you just cooked or you went to the grocery store, you'd be doing math. So, and we talked
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.020]   about, you know, the sale, knowing the sale price or knowing the correct change, which honestly,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:14.480]   we really need to check these people who give us change back now, because I don't think all of them
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.900]   know how to give correct change. That's why they don't count it back. They just put it in your hand
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:25.620]   and say, here you go. Yes. Yes. So we need to train our kids to know how to say, oh, I don't think you
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:33.520]   gave me all the right change. Yes, exactly. We could, we could fund a college, college on what
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:39.160]   you could get back and change if you got the right change. That's fantastic. And then even just the
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.520]   fact that I was thinking about artists as you were sharing too, that's another place that I think a lot
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:52.340]   of people don't necessarily expect, although the math map showcases it impeccably, but artists are
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:59.960]   constantly doing math because God, the whole world he created is mathematical. This physical world
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:07.680]   is mathematical and there is balance in good art. High quality art has the most balance. And so if
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.760]   you know your ratios and your brain can think in ratios and then like even decorating, I always loved
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.400]   interior design. That's another thing. I want to rearrange over half the rooms in my house right now,
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:24.520]   because it has occurred to me that the ratios are off. And since I know that, you know, now it's,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.880]   it's bothering. I can't unsee it, but it's, it's a math thing. I want the balance and I know exactly
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.860]   where these thirds need to land and, and that, that brings peace. So having your children really,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:40.280]   going back to the math, having your children come at this math conversation from an unconventional
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   way is, is a great thing. And the summertime is so ripe for this because you do have a little bit
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:55.660]   more flexibility usually in your schedule. So figure out what they're into. I promise you math is in the
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.900]   middle of it. If they like sports, there's a lot of math involved. If they like cooking, there's math
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.420]   in there. Legos, Legos. There's lots of, I mean, you could do with Legos, you know, like even just
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:12.300]   counting, but like building 3d objects or trying to build a 4d object. Cause it was hard for us to
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:17.840]   imagine what 4d is like building those kinds of weird objects. But Legos are so fun to play with
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.220]   math. I mean, you could even do like sorting games, you know, where you sort by color or you sort by,
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.980]   I don't know, like functionality, you know, like however many have two, however many have four,
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.560]   you know, that kind of thing. Cause we used to do that when, with, with writing, we were learning how
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.820]   to make an Annie chart. We would sort Legos or sort something in your kitchen drawer. The same thing
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.320]   with math. You have to sort numbers, right. Put them in because, you know, like if you can't, you can't
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.380]   add or subtract different numbers, you got to make sure they have that like fractions have to have the
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.780]   same denominator. Right. So you've got to know how to sort or you got to put them in the right format.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.700]   So, um, yeah, Legos are always fun in my house and I feel like that they're very mathematical.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.240]   Yeah. That's such a great point. So, and I was trying to think there was another thing I was
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:09.340]   trying to think, Oh, well, well we do have, um, but we talked about card games too, but just a plain
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:15.740]   deck of cards, right. You can have so many games just from a deck of cards. You can practice like
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.660]   adding, you can practice multiplying and dividing me. You can practice algebraic expressions
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:26.060]   just with a deck of cards. And so it's not that you have to go buy a bunch of stuff over the summer.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:32.260]   You probably have everything in your house, like a board game that's really mathematical or Legos or
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:39.620]   whatever it is. And you can make it into, you know, a math game. Exactly. And that applies to every
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:46.940]   age, every range of learning and understanding. It doesn't matter if your child is in the grammar phase
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:53.980]   or if they are in dialectic or rhetoric, you can do math with the things that you have around you.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:26:00.980]   Um, I love that you're making me really want to do some math calculations with sports. My, my son is
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:07.000]   very into baseball right now and I'm atrocious at it and he's phenomenal at it. And I bet you, if I knew
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.820]   a little bit more about like what I was supposed to be doing with my hand or the arc, he keeps trying to
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.200]   explain it to me. But of course he's serious. He can do it, but he can't articulate it. But he's like,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.340]   no, you're supposed to do it like this. If I got that, whatever that thing was, I bet it would
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.020]   change my life. And I promise you, it's attached to math. Um, I love this. Let's talk about, let's
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.700]   talk about breakthroughs and tension. Cause again, some of the reason why we have this stigma against
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.720]   diving into the conversation in math is that it can get emotional and challenging. And you've got a lot
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.040]   years under your belt of homeschooling. Um, can you maybe talk to us about a time when one of your
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:52.420]   students really was having a, a challenging, a challenging season with math and they had a
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:58.660]   breakthrough and what, what changed the game for them and how, how you navigated that with them?
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:07.620]   Well, I'm trying to think, I think one of the, one of the things that make, that can make students
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:17.420]   get overwhelmed is maybe the amount of work that's expected by mom or dad. So I was always the one who
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.720]   wanted them to finish the entire page. I did not want them to do odds or evens. I wanted them to do it
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:29.780]   all because I was afraid that if I didn't do odds or evens, they would miss something. Right. You
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:37.200]   know? And so I always wanted my kids to finish the entire page. And I think it got to a point where
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:43.400]   there was, there was one lesson that, um, it was so frustrating and he had been doing work for well
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:51.320]   over an hour and he was just frustrated and he just wasn't getting it. And I thought maybe I shouldn't
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.260]   make him, but I kept going back and forth. Like, should I make him finish? Should I not make him
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:00.960]   finish? And he took a break. He put it away for the rest of the day. And he went back to that same
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:08.420]   lesson the next day and something clicked and he got it. So he still finished the page. I still didn't go
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:15.400]   back on my, my, you know, I wanted you to finish the whole page. Um, but he just needed a break. And I
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:21.100]   think sometimes we just need the break. We just need a few minutes or maybe the rest of the day
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.420]   to think about something else. Um, and somebody was telling me that there's some kind of learning
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:32.180]   style thing where if your brain is just so clouded with this one concept you're trying to work on,
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.960]   just taking a break and doing something else and then coming back to it, you just look at it
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:44.700]   differently. And so I think that that helps is letting your kids take a break. Um, obviously if it's,
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:51.000]   if they're crying, then we need to stop, especially if my boys, like if my boys are crying about math,
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.660]   we need to stop. Like there's something really wrong. Um, or it might not necessarily be a math
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:02.540]   thing. It might be something else. Like maybe they know that we have to leave in 20 minutes to go
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.020]   somewhere and they know they can't finish this in 20 minutes. And so they're freaking out because
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:13.140]   they're not going to finish it. And it just so many emotions. So sometimes we have to kind of get to
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.700]   the real reason why they're being anxious or why they're having trouble. Is it because they're
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.200]   thinking of other things that they've got to get done or is it because this is too hard? This is
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   overwhelming right now. And I just need a break. So I think it's, we just have to know our kids,
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.720]   you know, and it's going to be trial and error. I mean, you know, we're not given a manual from the
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.320]   hospital where we're always trial and error. I mean, I guess we do have the Bible, right? That is probably
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.800]   the closest thing we have to a manual. But with these kinds of things, you know, I feel like it
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:48.040]   is trial and error, but I think, you know, your kid. So if every single day they're crying,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.780]   then there's something's got to change, right? There's got to be something different that we need
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:58.220]   to do. Maybe it's the curriculum, but maybe it's just something else, you know, maybe trying to get
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.740]   to the root of it. Maybe it's a character thing. Maybe I'm pushing them too hard. Maybe they don't need
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.880]   to do all the problems. Maybe they only need to do the odds or the evens, right? Or whatever,
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:13.440]   you know, whatever it is I'm making them do. Because I do feel like I expect a lot from my kids. I always
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.940]   have. And so there have been a couple of times when I've had to say, okay, we're not going to turn that
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.240]   paper in this week. I'll let you, I'll let you, you know, present from an outline because I know you
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.360]   worked hard and you got to this point, you know, so I think, you know, we have to know our kids and
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.920]   know where those lines are, but being willing to think outside of just, is it this math that I'm
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.100]   working on or is it something else? Is it a character thing or is it just stuff that's going on in my
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.720]   life that's distracting me from what I'm trying to work on right now? Does that make sense?
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.340]   Hey everyone, we want to interrupt this show to tell you about the classical learning cohort.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:57.360]   So the classical learning cohort is comprised of small groups of CC parents learning how to become
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.960]   more confident, competent classical teachers. I don't know about you, but being more confident
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:10.840]   as I'm teaching my children is exactly what I need and the CLC can get me there. So the CLC provides a
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:16.720]   welcome place for mentorship while helping you to practice the classical skills with hospitable
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.340]   assessment. With feedback from your peers and your mentors, you will experience the transformative
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:30.440]   growth as a classical Christian educator. So right now they're also offering a way for you to test out
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:38.120]   the CLC for free by attending one of their online events with a CLC mentor. All you need to do is go to
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:46.480]   classicalconversations.com forward slash cohort and search experience the CLC to find an event and time
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.220]   that fits your schedule. We hope that you enjoy the CLC. Let's get back to the show.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.620]   One hundred percent. And I mean, is it, are they hungry?
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.060]   Is it protein? You know, is it the time of day?
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.840]   Like something you just said made me think,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.880]   I wonder if part of my problem was the time of day because we would always do math in the afternoon.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.080]   That's just how we did it. That was our routine. Math was never our favorite.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.460]   So, you know, my mom didn't make us get it out of the way at the beginning of the day. I know that's
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:23.980]   a common thing to do. However, when I went to university, because of where I placed in math,
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:30.820]   I had one time that I could choose from and it was 8am. And then I went straight from my 8am class
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.660]   to the tutor. And we sat together for another hour because school wasn't even open yet. Like
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.540]   that's how early it was. And that's how behind, you know, I was for what I was trying to do.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.720]   And it was fine. But all that to say, I think I needed to do it at the beginning of the day. I think
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.740]   I needed to do it when my brain was fresh. My mind was fresh. I wasn't bogged down by anything else.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.980]   I didn't have anywhere else. I could be, you know, if nobody's even here right now, except for the people
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   who have to do this little math class. And that set me up for success. So I love that you're saying,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:09.160]   you know, kind of zoom out a little bit and take a step back and evaluate some of the other things
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:14.780]   that could be affecting your child. I didn't know until last week that if I told my child I was going
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:20.880]   to set a timer, which I, for me, that would have been, you know, encouraging that it would shut him
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:26.920]   down. He collapsed in 25 seconds. Just he couldn't handle it. The timer was the problem. It was the time
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.980]   constraint for me. I'm like, yes, now I have a goal. I didn't know. But again, maybe there's some sort
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.400]   of a figurative timer in your child's mind and they know that this other thing is happening because
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.080]   they do have a concept of time. And so they're feeling pressure, even though you didn't put that
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.560]   pressure there. Can you alleviate that? I just, I really wanted to reiterate what you said, because
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:56.060]   I think when it comes to topics like this or any challenge, some of it is the math problem itself,
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.860]   but most of it is everything around the math problem.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:06.640]   Yeah. And, and going back to your thing about the timer. So I used to test kids. I used to give the
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:13.220]   Woodcock Johnson the end of year test and the timer. Oh my goodness. If, if I didn't tell them I was
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:19.120]   timing them, it was fine. But as soon as they saw the timer or they heard that clicking or whatever,
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.280]   it was like, Oh, she's timing me. I got to do really well. I got to do this fast, you know? And
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:31.040]   so, yeah, it's your environment, right? What if you sit underneath a clock? What if your dinner table
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.300]   is underneath the clock and all they hear is, I think that would drive me bananas. And I don't know
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:42.840]   that I could concentrate. Whereas some kids could play music in their ears while they're doing their
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:48.280]   math. I can't do that either. I've tried to like have worship music on while I'm working and I can't
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.860]   concentrate. So everybody's different and we've got to figure out what that is. And that doesn't
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.280]   really have anything to do with, I mean, it does kind of have to do with math, but it's not just math
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.440]   as all the other subjects. So whatever we're doing to accommodate our kids in other subjects,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:09.740]   we need to do those with math. One thing I always, I hear about is, well, my kid has dyslexia, so he
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:17.020]   probably can't use this program. Sure he can. Whatever you've done in the other strands to, to help your
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:23.200]   student accomplish what you want them to accomplish, do those same things in math, right? If you look at
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.640]   a page and it's really, really busy, what do you do? Well, why don't you cover up everything except
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:34.780]   one little section? So all they have to do is focus on it. Or if you are using a digital device, make it
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:41.500]   bigger, right? Zoom it in and all they see is this one little thing. Because really our classical tools
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.760]   of attending, really paying attention to detail, oh, they would love that. They would love to pick
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:53.720]   one thing on this page and really pay attention to detail. So that's encouraging too, is that I don't
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:36:01.220]   necessarily think I need a specific curriculum for my student who has this challenge. It's just how am I
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.020]   going to approach it? Whatever I've been doing, you know, if I have to read aloud to my kid because they
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.700]   struggle reading. Well, as they get older, they can read audiobooks or they can look at the, you know,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:16.080]   on the Kindle, you can, it'll read it to you, but you can actually see the words as they, they tap,
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:22.760]   right? So whatever I've done for my student in another strand, I can also do that with math. So it's,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:29.120]   it's, it's still approachable, right? To, to any student out there, not just students who maybe be good,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:36.540]   you know, work it at math. That's so true. And, and I feel like that's probably one of the most
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:45.760]   empowering aspects of being the parent and their first teacher and therefore their best teacher,
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:53.520]   because the Lord has allowed you to spend all this time with this child so that you can get to know
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.860]   them. And of course we're continuing to learn, but, but that's the edge. That's, that's the
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:04.280]   advantage that the Lord gives you as the homeschool parent, because it's your kid. So whereas a teacher
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.700]   who just met them may or may not know what they need or what works for them in this other context,
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:16.280]   you know, because you've seen them under pressure in so many other contexts that your tool belt is so
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:21.420]   full. So you can, you can draw on that. And it's true that I think sometimes we,
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:28.800]   maybe we default to what we've seen before when it comes to approaching certain subjects,
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.080]   especially math, especially science, some of those more, you know, heady topics, as we say.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:39.000]   And so we just think to ourselves, okay, well, I can't apply what I know to be true about
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.460]   this other topic to math, because that's not how it's done. It doesn't matter how it's done.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.240]   God has put you in charge of your child's education. And so this is what we're going to do.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:56.080]   Yeah, exactly. And I mean, constantly going back to him, you know, like my, my two boys are
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.900]   completely different. What worked for my first was completely opposite of what my second, you know,
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:06.540]   so I'm still learning, right. Even as the older they get, we're still learning, but constantly going
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.580]   back to him and saying, Lord, help me know the right words to say to them. Or the white, if I'm,
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.860]   if I'm teaching something, give me the right words to explain this so that they understand,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:22.680]   or give me patience as they're learning this and not me expecting them to get it on the first try.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.540]   Right. Cause that it might not be that they're going to get it today. They might get it a week
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:32.300]   later. They might get it next year. Right. So continually going back to him, I think is so
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.240]   important to, to keep him as part of your schooling, no matter what subject you're doing
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   is keeping him in the forefront, like going to him and say, Lord, I just don't get it. I'm not
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.860]   understanding this. Can you help me explain this? Can you help me understand this? And he will,
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.840]   he definitely will.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:53.100]   He will. He's a good father. He knows how to give good gifts to his children. He's not withholding
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:01.460]   from us. You know, he's not like us. We may be flaky. We don't know everything, but he's not like
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:07.920]   that. And we can go to him for the answers and he wants to, he's waiting. I love that, that he's just
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:15.480]   waiting to give us the wisdom that we are, are looking for. Um, it's such an encouragement. And also I think
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:22.520]   that's, that's the beauty and the benefit that, that we get as the parent, like our, we're, we want our
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:28.540]   child to learn this math that we probably already did learn, but the benefit we get is walking with
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:33.080]   the Lord and walking with them in the process of them learning. We're learning maybe something
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:39.140]   completely unrelated, but it's growing our character while their character is growing as well. And that
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:46.960]   that's very true. Very true. Well, I know that I have a feeling you and I could talk for a long time
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:54.300]   about this. I'm curious about one of the questions that I sent you beforehand, which is about meeting
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:40:01.020]   God in the numbers. I'd never thought about this concept until I talked to Kirstie Gilpin. Never,
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:06.600]   never thought about it. Meeting God in the numbers. Like, what are you talking about? I know how to beg
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:14.160]   him for answers because I'm confused, but actually seeing his character in numbers, that was a new
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:20.600]   concept to me until I started interacting with the math map. And I'll be honest with you. I know it might
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.340]   sound dramatic, but it changed my life. It changed the way that I looked at the world around me because
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:31.720]   I just wasn't thinking, Hey, here's this tree. And it doesn't just illustrate the beauty of God,
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:40.880]   but it illustrates his order and like the structure and aspects of his intentionality and his character
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:48.440]   that you can only see if you know math. So since you get to work on the math map and you get to have
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.700]   these conversations with these brilliant ladies all the time, do you have an example of a time that
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.320]   you've met God in the numbers or through math recently?
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:07.220]   So I see it everywhere now. It's kind of weird. It's almost like you didn't know it was there before
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:15.340]   and now you're like, wow, like it's all around you. But I think a couple of weeks ago we had our week 30,
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:21.700]   our class, and they were sharing, they're seeing the unseen. They have to make this booklet where they
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.800]   walk around and they, they just pick random things. They draw pictures of them in their,
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.860]   in their booklet. And then they tell us where they see God and where they see math.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:37.680]   And this one kid, I wasn't really sure what he got the whole year. I, you know, every, every week,
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.900]   you know, he would participate and he would, um, you know, he would do what he was supposed to do,
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:48.460]   but he, he didn't talk very much. And so I wasn't really sure what is he getting right? What is,
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:53.840]   and he could be getting more at home than, than in community, but he shared this one thing in his
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.460]   booklet and it almost made me cry. I like ran to his mom. I was like, ah, I need to tell you what he
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:04.300]   shared. So he drew a picture of a stop sign. And I said, okay, tell me where you see math and your
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:10.140]   stop sign. And he said, well, there's, there's angle lines. Um, sometimes there's parallel lines
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:15.000]   depending on what, you know, what sides you're looking on. It's obviously a shape, right? And I said,
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.280]   okay, well, how do you see God in a stop sign? And he said, well, the stop sign tells you what to do.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:25.320]   And then it also protects you because if you don't do what it says, then you get, you know,
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:29.820]   a car runs into you. And that's what God does, right? He gives you instructions. He tells you what to
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:36.600]   do. And then he protects you. He's giving you those things to protect you. And I was just floored. I'm
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:43.700]   like, this kid's 13 years old. And that's what he got from looking at a stop sign because of all of
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.040]   these conversations that we've had in community about looking at things and trying to see the math
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   and trying to see God. And I just got goosebumps. And I was like, wow, like if that is all you got,
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:02.620]   which I'm sure he got more, if that's all he got, what a big deal. And so it just made me think of all
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:09.200]   the little things that I take for granted looking around. Maybe God was showing me that stop sign
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.600]   over and over again. And I just, it just wasn't clicking to me that that's the connection. And I
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.620]   had a 13 year old to point it out to me to say, what, did you know that this stop sign really shows
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:25.980]   you God's character and what, you know, that just goes to show you that our kids do teach us so much
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:31.260]   more than what we think, right? We think we're teaching them, but man, they're really teaching us.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:37.880]   And so I get excited about the math map just because of that conversation that we get to have
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:43.940]   with those kids. We look at a piece of art and we try to find math stuff. We try to find God in this
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:52.000]   work of art. It starts out very comical. Like a week one, there's this, it's like all these things
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.680]   jumbled up together. There's this, there's this dog at the bottom of the screen and, and he's very
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.900]   malnourished. And my kids will say, well, I see God because there's a dog there and God made dogs.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:08.700]   Okay. I mean, that's really simplistic. Well, I'll try to point out where there's an, there's an angel
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.260]   in this picture and she looks really sad. Like, why do you think this angel is sad? And he was like,
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:19.080]   well, obviously the dog's bones are sticking out. Nobody fed the dog. That's why she's sad.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:24.260]   And so getting to have those conversations, that's how they start at the beginning of the year,
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:30.140]   but then they end up like the stop sign. And so if we get to be a part of that,
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.300]   just a little bit of that at home, watching our kids as they're learning that, or if we get the
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.400]   opportunity to direct and we get to see our kids do it, you know, other kids do it. That's where I see
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:48.740]   him all the time is just showing me himself in little bitty things all around me. And I mean,
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:54.000]   would I have said that like six years ago when I agreed to be in a pilot? No, I was just,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.820]   I was just excited that I got to be in a pilot because I thought that was really cool. But now,
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.960]   I mean, just watching how much I've learned about God, just by looking around me at little things,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:10.360]   every single thing I look at, I should be able to connect it to God. Right. And so being able to do
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.460]   that now, I feel like I would have never had that opportunity. If I haven't had wanted to study math
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:22.700]   or wanted to study this a little bit more. So it's kind of a, it's not really one thing. It's just,
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:29.000]   it's continuous. We always, I always feel like I can see it. I just have to be mindful, right? I got
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.860]   to pay attention. I can't be busy 24 hours a day or I'm going to miss it. But being intentional,
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:39.200]   like just going for a walk with your kids and just asking them, where do you see math out here?
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.660]   Like, you know, you're talking about the trees or looking at the branches and whatever the patterns,
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.460]   where do you see, where do you see math here? Where do you see God here? And that's,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.560]   that doesn't take any prep. There's nothing I have to print out and make my kids worksheets for.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:56.880]   I'm just taking a walk outside and asking them a question. There's not a right or wrong answer.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:02.040]   We're just asking, where do I see God here? Where do I see math here? And let those connections
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:11.200]   kind of come together. Yeah. And the thing is, he is revealing himself. I think sometimes
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:18.820]   we feel so much pressure, or at least I'll speak for myself, but I bet you do too. Sometimes I feel
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:23.040]   so much pressure to try to orchestrate the moment. You know, it's like, you're trying to orchestrate
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.760]   the light bulb moment. And I was a teacher for years before I even became a parent. So I know what
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.640]   it's like to make your plans and you have these goals for these children and they need to learn
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   this thing. But at the end of the day, who brings the enlightenment? Who gives the knowledge? It's not
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.220]   you. It's such a privilege to be in the room. And yeah, you better be faithful to do whatever your job
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:51.780]   is. So ask the question. But at the end of the day, God is revealing himself. He is revealing himself.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:58.760]   He is faithful to do that. And he's going to show your kids something about himself that he might not
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:04.680]   show you. And you're going to learn it through them. And so you don't have to worry when you're going out
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.260]   and you're saying, oh, I don't even know the answer to this question. Well, that's okay. You can still
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:14.480]   ask the question. Let's discover together. Where do we see God outside? Who knows? I don't know what's
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:20.340]   going to happen out here. This is the wild. It could be anything. But that's part of the adventure
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:29.300]   and the honor. So thank you so much for having this conversation with me today, Babs. I hope that
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:36.360]   you all listening are encouraged by it. That two women who would have definitely told you within 10
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.040]   years ago that they didn't want to have anything to do with math and that's why they have the jobs that
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:46.740]   they have and have lived the lives that they've lived. We're passionate about it. We're excited about
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:52.440]   it. And it's not just because we love the numbers and we've learned that, okay, our limitations weren't
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.800]   what we thought they were, although they are not what we thought they were. It's because we met the
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:03.580]   Lord there. And we are seeing that in the same way we're so passionate and excited to know God and to
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:09.340]   make him known in the other areas of our life. This is a whole area of our life where we can do that too.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.940]   And we can inspire our children to do that. So this summer, while you're playing math games,
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.780]   you're outside and you're playing sports and you're cooking and you're doing all of this stuff,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:26.040]   we'd love to hear from you and to see where you are doing math in your daily life and being an
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:33.020]   everyday educator and leading the learning. And so please definitely follow us on social media so you
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.480]   can tag us in your pictures or tell us your stories because we really do want to hear what
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:43.940]   you're doing. We do this for you. And also share the show with a friend who maybe has been discouraged
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:49.820]   about their math journey or their learning journey and need to be reminded that it's all about God.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:57.340]   It's all about the Lord because that's the truth of the matter. And he is always in the process of
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:02.760]   trying to show himself to us. And so we are the ones who need to slow down and look for him and
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.900]   we're not going to be disappointed when we do that. Thank you guys for listening. We will talk to you
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.520]   again next week. Have a good one.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   Bye.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   Bye.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   Thank you.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.020]   you
