[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   We're going to begin this session by teaching you a new song.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.200]   It's always wonderful to be here at Grace Community Church and to be here at the Shepherd
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.880]   Conference with so many friends.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   And we're going to lead you, we're going to accompany as you sing in this session before
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.120]   Austin Duncan comes and leads us.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.360]   And this is a new song.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.780]   This is actually possibly the reason we are here.
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.900]   Over the years, we're grateful for many reasons to be here, but one is the personal encouragement
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.120]   that John MacArthur was to myself, to Kristen, and even in raising four girls and many little
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.520]   cups of coffee and phone calls and texts over the years.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.000]   And when he was, I think, when he was going into hospital a few months ago, I sent him
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   this hymn that we had just finished called Christus Victor, and he asked us to come and
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   do it this evening.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480]   So we're going to do it this evening, but we thought we'd use this moment now to teach
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   it.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.880]   And it's based on two of the hymns of the Bible, the first hymn of the Bible, and then
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.560]   it echoes one of the last hymns in Revelation as well.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.560]   We called it Christus Victor.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.760]   So I'm going to teach you the three little sections, and then we'll stand and sing it.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.040]   So Kristen's going to sing the verse, verse one, here we go.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:32.680]   O most high King of the ages, great I am, God of wonders, by the blood you have redeemed
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   us.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:59.480]   O most high King of the ages, great I am, God of wonders, by the blood you have redeemed
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   us.

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Lamb upon the throne.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Be blessing on our glory, be blessing on our glory, be blessing on our glory.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   O most high King of the ages, great I am, God of wonders, by the blood you have redeemed

[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   O most high King of the ages, great I am, God of wonders, by the blood you have redeemed
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   us.

[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   upon the throne.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:41.280]   Be blessing on our glory, be blessing on our glory, be blessing on our glory, be blessing
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   on our glory.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   O most high King of the ages, great I am, God of wonders, by the blood you have redeemed

[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:15.500]   (audience applauding)
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.660]   (audience applauding)
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:31.820]   - Thank you to the Gettys and John Martin
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.820]   for leading us so well this morning.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.900]   What an absolute delight that was.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.900]   I invite you to open your Bibles to the book of Jonah.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.060]   My assignment is to speak on Jonah,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.920]   the reluctant missionary.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.300]   And I would like to focus on Jonah chapter four.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.100]   Jonah chapter four.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.220]   Start reading to you in Jonah chapter four, verse one.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:27.340]   "But it greatly distressed Jonah and he became angry.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:35.380]   "And then he prayed to Yahweh and said,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.920]   "Ah, Yahweh, was this not what I said
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.660]   "when I was still in my own country?
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.060]   "That's why I fled to Tarshish,
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:54.060]   "for I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:20:01.720]   "slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.080]   "and one who relents concerning evil."
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   "So now, O Yahweh, please take my life from me,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:20.940]   "for death is better to me than life.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:28.120]   "But Yahweh said, 'Do you have good reason to be angry?'"
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   Now Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   He made a shelter for himself there and sat in its shade
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.480]   until he could see what would happen to the city.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.600]   Then Yahweh God appointed a plant
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.960]   and made it grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.800]   to deliver him from his distress.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.660]   And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:10.720]   Then God appointed a worm when dawn came up the next day,
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.660]   and it attacked the plant, and it withered.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:23.480]   And when the sun rose, God appointed a biting east wind,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.380]   and the sun beat down on Jonah's head,
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.120]   and he became faint and asked to die,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.400]   saying, "It's better for me to die than to live."
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.220]   And then God said to Jonah,
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.960]   "Are you rightly angry, burned up over the plant?"
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.720]   And he said, "Rightly, I'm so burned up I could die."
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:56.760]   And then Yahweh said, "You have had pity over the plant,
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.740]   "though you did not toil over it or make it grow.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.760]   "It came up in a night and perished in a night.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.300]   "And should I not have compassion on Nineveh,
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.380]   "the great city in which there are more than
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:23.380]   "120,000 persons who do not know the difference
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.940]   "between their right and left hand, as well as many cattle?"
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:35.980]   So reads the word of the living God.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.780]   Father, help us to recognize in this prophecy
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:49.780]   all that you have prepared for us and for our hearts.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.580]   We are blessed ministers to be gathered here
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.660]   under the authority of your word.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.380]   Do the work that only your spirit can do
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.460]   through your word in our hearts
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.460]   to make us share in the very heart of our God.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:14.860]   I ask this in Jesus' matchless name, amen.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.100]   When my kids were little,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.660]   they're high school, college age now,
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.500]   but when they were little, we had eight books on Jonah.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.820]   When they were infants,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.460]   we had the puffy books that you could chew on.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:38.220]   Their favorite was called Whale's Big Catch.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.360]   And I'm here to confess my failure as a father,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.860]   because as I paged through it
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.020]   in preparation for this message,
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.020]   [audience laughing]
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:55.740]   I realized it lacked some theological accuracy.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.900]   [audience laughing]
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   It's a book consumed with what most children's books
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.280]   about Jonah are interested in,
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.420]   which is the subterranean predicament
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.180]   that Jonah finds himself in the belly of the great fish.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.660]   It's full of cartoon illustrations
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.660]   and onomatopoeia like Splish Splash and Pew Stink.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:30.380]   My favorite page has Jonah's thought bubble,
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.060]   and he's picturing all the people of Nineveh,
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   including a really angry-looking evil baby in his mind.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:44.420]   But it's not just those who try to accommodate
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.380]   the message of Jonah to the youngest among us
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.500]   who miss its point.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.860]   The great American novelist Herman Melville
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.180]   puts these words on the tongue of Father Mapple,
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.780]   the chaplain of the ship in Moby Dick.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.820]   His sermon in, I think, chapter 19 goes like this,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.460]   ninth chapter.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.860]   The book containing only four chapters, four yarns,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.320]   the book of Jonah is one of the smallest strands
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.940]   in the mighty cable of the scriptures.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.940]   Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sea line sound?
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.540]   What a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.340]   What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.640]   How billow-like and boisterously grand.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.400]   We feel the flood surging over us.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.020]   We sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.780]   Seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.940]   But what is the lesson that the book of Jonah
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.700]   teaches shipmates?
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.020]   It's a two-stranded lesson.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.660]   A lesson to all of us as sinful men.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.220]   A lesson to me as a pilot of the living God
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.080]   as a sinful man.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.700]   It's a lesson to all of us because it's the story
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.340]   of the sin-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears,
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.820]   the swift punishment, repentant prayers,
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.380]   and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.340]   I don't think Melville read the last chapter.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.820]   A little book, it's only 48 verses long,
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.820]   it tells a story of what happens in the 8th century BC.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.740]   But I find in it, the more I think about
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   this reluctant prophet,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.940]   some sad similarities to the low state
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.820]   of my own heart at times.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.460]   I find it fascinating that in the synagogue calendar,
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.940]   as the scriptures, the Old Testament scriptures
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.720]   were read in the synagogues in the synagogue period,
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.260]   according to the liturgy and the calendar,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.220]   it was on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement,
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.460]   that they would read the book of Jonah aloud
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.580]   and the people would traditionally respond,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.040]   we are Jonah.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.060]   And I wonder if we're there.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.520]   Because we read this and we laugh
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.300]   at this pouting prophet,
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.020]   at how outrageous it is that he's angry with God,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.460]   how foul he is after experiencing
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.020]   the incredible commissioning at the beginning of the book
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.500]   to go to a people that were not his own
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.460]   in a period of Israel's sinful idolatry
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.020]   and to go minister in a place that was bloodthirsty
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:43.020]   and violent and Jonah's white knuckled defiance
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:48.380]   is shocking to us as he goes the opposite way
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.020]   that God asks him to go and then becomes
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.180]   a coincidental missionary to some pagan sailors
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.580]   who are eager to hear about Yahweh.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.120]   Their response is heartfelt and genuine
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.020]   as they cry out to the covenant God by name
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.340]   in chapter one, verse 14, oh Lord,
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.300]   do not let us perish on account of this man's life
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.060]   and do not put innocent blood on us
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.420]   for thou, oh Yahweh, hast done as thou hast pleased.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:24.900]   I mean, Jonah's ministry is remarkable in its fruitfulness.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:31.180]   The Mishnah says that these men, after dropping off Jonah,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.700]   went straight to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.200]   and probably have a painful surgery.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.080]   I mean, Jonah's picking up incidental converts
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.680]   and his attitude is so bad he demands death,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.000]   not just in chapter four but in chapter two.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.880]   But as he comes to his senses
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.280]   and announces the reality of God's salvation
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.800]   from the belly of the great fish,
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.500]   chapter two, verse nine, I will sacrifice to thee
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.360]   with the voice of thanksgiving that which I have vowed
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.640]   I will pay, salvation is from the Lord,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   we start to get closer and closer to the message of Jonah
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.560]   and how it ought to resonate in our own hearts
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.440]   if we can focus on the right thing.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.800]   But then something so grand and spectacular happens.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.520]   In five Hebrew words, Jonah fulfills his commission
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   and preaches to Nineveh and Nineveh responds
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.400]   and turns, the Hebrew word shub, to turn, to repent,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.920]   is used over and over again in this chapter
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.960]   and God turns, verse 10, is in a way
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.360]   completely unique to God.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.700]   When God saw their deeds that they turned from their wicked
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.260]   way then God turned and concerning the calamity
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.020]   he had declared he would bring upon them
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.060]   and he did not do it.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.060]   Their repentance was so thorough going
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.160]   even their animals repented.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:19.180]   Sackcloth and ashes for everybody, the king, the poor.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.980]   And that seems a good place to end the book of Jonah.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   But if we ended there we would be stuck
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.660]   with the children's book and stuck with Moby Dick
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   because we wouldn't get to the focus,
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.180]   the purpose, the message of the book of Jonah
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.920]   which is found in chapter four.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.940]   A book of defiance and deliverance,
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.500]   a defiant prophet who flees the presence of God
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.020]   and prefers death over obedience.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.180]   A great fish swallowing him, Yahweh rescuing him
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.660]   and vomiting him out into the shore.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:04.440]   Jonah's remarkable psalm from the depths of the sea
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.120]   crying out to proclaim the salvation of God,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.640]   the redeployment of Jonah on this great Assyrian capital,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.060]   the incredible revival in Nineveh
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.860]   where these bloodthirsty and pagan people
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.060]   cry out to the covenant God of Israel
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.200]   and he turns his wrath away and grants them repentance.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.060]   We start to realize as we look to chapter four
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.140]   this isn't a fish story, this isn't a parable of some kind
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.380]   or some morals to take away,
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.720]   what are the whales in your life, brothers?
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.580]   But instead this is a theological book,
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.880]   a book that is not centered on a fish or on a man,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.900]   a book that tells us what God is like
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.460]   and we need the message of Jonah
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.220]   and there's no better place to find it
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.900]   than in this fourth chapter.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.380]   As the entire prophecy is brought into a summary
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.540]   in an unguessable way and it exposes the wisdom of God
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.840]   and his plan in putting all this together
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.820]   and seeing Jonah's stubbornness and recalcitrance
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.580]   at the end and the hard heart
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.540]   leaves us as readers scratching our heads
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.420]   and confused about how we're to respond to this message
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.060]   but if we pay careful attention,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.580]   especially to this chapter,
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.500]   the very word of the living God,
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.420]   we can see why it's such an important message
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.380]   to learn about this oddball prophet
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.380]   and recognize in ourselves similar deficiencies,
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.380]   similar defiance but make sure our focus is on God
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.300]   and his heart of compassion.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:52.260]   What a book, what a chapter.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.940]   It ends with a question,
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.860]   a question that just sits there with no resolution.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:05.020]   As the centuries passed, Jewish scholarship
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.700]   added all kinds of annotations to the end,
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.960]   dissatisfied with this lingering question
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.060]   and trying to bring resolution
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.620]   either with Jonah sticking to his rebellious position
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.260]   and disposition or Jonah relenting
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.700]   and buying into the logic that God is offering him
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.700]   but that's not what Jonah 4, 11 does.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.260]   It leaves us with a question
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.660]   and it's not having us meditate on the ship of sailors
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.500]   or a city of sinners or even a defiant prophet.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.220]   It's about the character of God.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.620]   The main concern of this book is brought into focus,
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:54.420]   a God whose compassion, the key word of chapter four,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.280]   is put on magnificent display.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.940]   A God whose mercy is incomprehensible
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.680]   in its depth and breadth.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.980]   Jim Boyce titled this chapter,
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.620]   "A God More Compassionate Than His Prophets"
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.180]   and to study Jonah chapter four as a minister
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.940]   and as a missionary, as a pastor,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.260]   is to look at a careful study in God's compassion.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.560]   So let's look at chapter four
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.500]   as it unfolds in these three scenes.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.660]   Let's start, number one, with the confrontation
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.860]   with God's character.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.820]   A confrontation with God's character
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.040]   in verses one through three
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.640]   and then verses four through nine,
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.420]   a conversation in God's classroom
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.420]   and then third and finally, a challenge in God's question,
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.820]   verse 10 and 11.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.420]   Let's look at these piece by piece.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.300]   Remember how this opens, chapter three, verse 10.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.380]   When God saw their deeds
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.660]   that they turned from their wicked way,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.540]   he relented concerning the calamity
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.560]   which he had declared and would bring upon them
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.820]   and he did not do it.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:08.240]   Verse one, but it greatly displeased Jonah.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.140]   Literally, it was a great evil to Jonah.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.140]   This has a Hebrew wordplay in this chapter
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.500]   between the word evil, rah, and the word good, tob.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.280]   And it brings this concept of evil right into focus
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.020]   and it's not necessarily a moral evil
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.620]   in the assessment of Jonah,
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.620]   but instead, the word evil means a massive disaster,
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.300]   incredible distress, a bad situation.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.740]   And Jonah, in his prophecy,
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.180]   we've already seen lots of evil,
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.560]   mainly Nineveh categorized this way.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.420]   But now Jonah directs his great displeasure
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.620]   and his assessment of the repentance of this pagan city
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.920]   as a total disaster.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.920]   It was evil to Jonah, a great evil, and it burned to him.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.260]   Verse one.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.720]   Combining that other theme in the book of Jonah,
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.000]   that word great.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.740]   Nineveh's been called great, the storm is great,
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.300]   the fish is great, the wind is great,
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.900]   and now the disaster in Jonah's assessment
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.060]   can only be described as massive, as great.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:32.260]   The city has turned from their wicked ways
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.480]   and now God has relented from his judgment.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   And this great fish is now followed by a great evil
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:50.200]   because of the repentance of this great city.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.420]   And Jonah is concerned about the very character of God.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.600]   His assessment of the outcome of his ministry
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.440]   is it's all a disaster.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.760]   In the opening scene of the book,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.080]   you have a prophet arguing against God's mercy.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.760]   A prophet of Yahweh opposed to Yahweh's compassion.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.440]   He has a problem here in chapter four with God's character
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.980]   and it's easy to punch on Jonah.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:25.760]   Please note verse two, it says he prayed to Yahweh and said,
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.440]   and before we're too hard on Jonah,
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.120]   at least Jonah took his theological problem
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.400]   to the right place.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:42.720]   Too many pastors wrongly angry with God.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.940]   There's nothing excusable about Jonah's anger towards God.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.840]   Too many pastors have abandoned their posts
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.040]   and abandoned their prayers
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.960]   instead of bringing their sinful problem to God.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.320]   In that way, Jonah is commendable here,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   at least in part because he knows where to take his troubles
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.880]   and if you've ever experienced difficulty in the ministry
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.580]   and if you've been a pastor for more than 15 seconds,
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.600]   you have.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:24.800]   If you've ever studied a text
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.680]   and wrestled with a theological problem
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.160]   about the character and nature of God,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.280]   if you've lived in a fallen world,
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.000]   you've encountered these things that bring us
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.160]   to a place of theological and practical perplexity
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.280]   and to deal with them before God is what's commendable
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.920]   in Jonah's moment of sinful anger here.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.520]   Though he ascribes great evil to the decision God has made
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.340]   to grant the Ninevites repentance,
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.240]   at least he takes his problem to God.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.360]   He prays to Yahweh
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.660]   and though he's sulky and bad-tempered,
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.360]   at least his irritation and annoyance drives him to pray.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.240]   Does yours?
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.720]   Or do you take it out on the precious people
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.960]   that God has saved?
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:25.160]   When we're in trouble,
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.520]   when we've encountered difficulty in ministry,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.440]   it's our first instinct to bring our troubles
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.360]   in honesty and transparency
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.380]   to the throne room of heaven.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:47.640]   Verse two helps me and points me to where I need to go
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.600]   when my thinking is not right.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.200]   Take it to God, brothers.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:57.720]   It's not clear why Jonah is angry specifically
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.120]   and exactly.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.180]   Commentators speculate why Jonah is angry with God.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.920]   Is he specifically angry because God spared Nineveh?
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.640]   Opinions are various.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.440]   Some consider Jonah to be a straight-up racist.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.160]   He has narrow exclusivism.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.180]   Calvin said it's because Jonah didn't wanna appear
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.540]   as a false prophet.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.360]   Some say there's political motivation
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.460]   because of Israel's enemies were being spared
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.720]   and what that entailed for the people,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.880]   the covenant people of God.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.840]   Some say that Jonah didn't buy the Ninevites' repentance
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.440]   as genuine.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.800]   Some question it because of a subsequent generation
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.560]   of Ninevites were judged by God.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.840]   Assyrians would fall under God's wrath,
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.240]   but it wasn't the same Ninevites.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.840]   It was a different generation, a different prophecy.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.800]   My reading of chapter three, I think,
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.680]   is national repentance,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.200]   and though it was perfunctory and generational,
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.480]   I think it was genuine.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.360]   At this point in the story,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.160]   the Ninevites are genuinely repentant,
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.240]   and so Jonah, whether he bought into it or not,
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.520]   I don't think that's the main reason for his anger.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.200]   Some say it's Jonah's nationalism
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.840]   because he believed that idolaters deserve judgment
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.160]   or the relationship between Amos and Hosea
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.880]   because Amos and Hosea were the prophets
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.740]   that would denounce Nineveh eventually
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.040]   in a later subsequent time,
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.940]   or perhaps it was because Jonah hopes
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.580]   that judgments on Nineveh might bring true repentance
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.420]   on an idolatrous Israel.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.280]   But we don't know the reason specifically
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.460]   behind Jonah's anger except what we're told,
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.260]   and we're told that Jonah is angry
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.620]   because God has been merciful to Nineveh.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:41.500]   John McHugh says Jonah did not like God's way of being God.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:47.300]   Davis says God is acting in a way
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.580]   that Jonah did not approve of.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.200]   And I think these brothers are helping us
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.380]   keep our focus on the text and what it actually says
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.180]   rather than conjecture here
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.160]   and what might or might not be going on behind the scenes.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.340]   And when we do, we see something of tremendous value
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.460]   start to unfold in verse two towards the second half.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.900]   There is this meaty confessional or creedal statement.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.780]   "In order to forestall this," Jonah says,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.660]   "I fled to Tarshish, for I knew,"
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.580]   here's Jonah's theological, logical response
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.440]   to God's mercy in Nineveh.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.180]   "For I knew," this is spectacular,
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:39.440]   "that you are a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.640]   "slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.640]   "and one who relents concerning evil."
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   And those words are so familiar to us,
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.480]   familiar to every follower of God
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   because that is the basis of the statement of faith
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.460]   of the people of Israel.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.740]   In Numbers 14, it says,
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.700]   "The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love,
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.720]   "forgiving iniquity and transgressions,
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.840]   "but he will by no means clear the guilty,
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.260]   "visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.660]   "to the third and fourth generation.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.420]   "Please pardon the iniquity of the people
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.140]   "according to the greatness of your steadfast love,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:28.140]   "just as you've forgiven the people from Egypt until now."
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:35.120]   This theological content is all over the Old Testament.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.280]   You go to the Psalm, Psalm 86,
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.060]   it says, "Be gracious to me, O Lord,
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.720]   "for to you do I cry all the day,
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.400]   "glad in the soul of your servant,
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.000]   "for to you, O Lord, do not lift up my soul,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.420]   "for you, O Lord, are good and forgiving,
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.720]   "abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.740]   "Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer,
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.320]   "listen to my plea for grace.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.840]   "In the day of my trouble, I call upon you to answer me.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   "There is none like you among the gods, O Lord,
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   "nor are there any works like yours,
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.960]   "but you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.000]   "slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.720]   "and faithfulness."
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.280]   Psalm 86, 15.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.640]   Throughout the Old Testament,
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.280]   God is praised for these same attributes.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.800]   In Nehemiah, towards the end of the Old Testament,
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.040]   chapter nine, verse 17,
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.500]   "In the moment of Israelites' national confession,
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.560]   "if they're brought back into their decimated land
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.260]   "with a broken temple, they speak these words.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.960]   "They refuse to obey, were not mindful of the wonders
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.980]   "you performed among them,
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.860]   "confessing the sins of their forebears.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.860]   "They stiffen their neck and appointed a leader
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.840]   "to return to the slavery in Egypt,
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.860]   "but you are a God ready to forgive,
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.340]   "gracious and merciful, slow to anger
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.300]   "and abounding in steadfast love and did not forsake them."
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:00.400]   Later in the book of Nehemiah, at the end of the same prayer,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.720]   what do the people say in their contrition?
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.500]   Well, they talk about God in the exact same language.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.960]   "Nevertheless, in your great mercy,"
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.900]   Nehemiah 9, 31 and 32.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.700]   "Nevertheless, in your great mercies,
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.880]   "did you not make an end of them or forsake them,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.140]   "for you are a gracious and merciful God.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.280]   "Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty,
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.740]   "the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love,
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.580]   "let all the hardship seem little to you
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.800]   "that has come upon us, upon our kings,
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.420]   "our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers,
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.540]   "all your people since the time of the kings of Assyria
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.800]   "until this day."
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.680]   Or Psalm 116, five, "Gracious is the Lord and righteous.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.140]   "Our Lord is merciful."
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.280]   Joel 2, 13, "Wren your hearts, not your garments.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.320]   "Return to Yahweh your God, for He is gracious and merciful,
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.120]   "slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love,
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.720]   "and He relents over disaster."
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.560]   It's everywhere.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.800]   And all of it derives throughout the Old Testament.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.360]   I gave you six or eight examples.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.960]   But it's pretty clear that this is the very heart
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.540]   of Israelite theology.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.160]   Something that's the very foundation
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.640]   of all biblical theology about the nature of God.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.440]   And every one of these psalmists or kings or leaders
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.040]   or deliverers or builders or prophets or poets or people
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.920]   are all drawing on this same concept.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.760]   All of it comes from the same place.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.300]   It's God's revelation of Himself in Exodus 34.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.160]   I mean, look at it briefly with me.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.640]   Exodus 34.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:49.720]   I know it's familiar to us, but that might be the problem.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:57.960]   Verse six, because it was certainly familiar
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.100]   to Jonah, wasn't it?
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.940]   Yahweh passed before him and proclaimed,
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.380]   it's Yahweh, Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious,
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.860]   slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.500]   and faithfulness.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.700]   Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.400]   abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.300]   keeping steadfast love for thousands,
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.260]   forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.820]   but who will by no means clear the guilty,
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.140]   visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children,
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.380]   the children's children to the third and fourth generation.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.980]   And Moses quickly bowed his head
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.580]   towards the earth and worshiped.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.200]   And here's what's amazing about this foundational treatment
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.580]   of the character of God.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:44.860]   The context is idolatry.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:50.460]   Isn't that what Exodus 32 is all about?
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.500]   Moses finds the people in their sin
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.220]   and it's in response to their sin
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.960]   that God reveals Himself to Moses and to the people.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.100]   Everyone's a theologian.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   And this text reminds us that there's a difference
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   between what we confess and what we actually believe.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:18.820]   To be able to articulate the heart of God
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:23.820]   in its revelation of Himself in biblical theology,
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.940]   but to not be able to embrace that truth
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.440]   is what's making Jonah so uneasy.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.600]   Jonah's doctrine is correct.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.920]   His theology is impeccable,
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.260]   but he doesn't like where this is leaving him.
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:46.240]   He's not content with the character of God.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.480]   Ellison writes this, "What is clear is that Jonah
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.960]   "was finding fault with God as He really is,
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.760]   "not as He imagined Him to be."
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.540]   And that's a common problem.
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.640]   Lots of people say wrongly,
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.320]   "Well, I think God is like this."
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.560]   Well, God would never do that
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:07.120]   because I think God is like this.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.600]   That's not what Jonah's doing.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.640]   Jonah's a Calvinist.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.960]   He knows his stuff,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.400]   but he's not living it.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   The problem was Jonah had not yet adjusted his perspective
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.820]   to match God's perspective.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.680]   You see, Jonah understood that God was merciful
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.640]   because God had said He was merciful,
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.120]   but Jonah had grown hard-hearted and resented God's mercy.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.740]   And this is particularly ironic
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.360]   because Jonah had just been the recipient of God's mercy.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.760]   But that's not as hard as we think.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.340]   We live in an evil and fallen world, brothers,
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.720]   and we are becoming increasingly aware
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.160]   of the need for the justice of God.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.400]   And we see confusion on every level of society
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.520]   and idolatry and wickedness and rebellion
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.280]   against the very elemental aspects
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.820]   of creation and God's design.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:20.120]   Shocking miscarriages of justice,
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:25.040]   a general disdain of righteousness,
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.200]   a promotion of violence and evil.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.160]   And it might be mindful for us to make sure
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.320]   that we're not more aware of God's judgment
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.400]   than God's mercy.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.600]   And this is what it comes down to
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.080]   is theology has to affect you.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.800]   It must be experiential.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.240]   You must believe what God says about Himself,
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.840]   but not just believe it, but embrace it.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.360]   To affirm mercy is one thing.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.260]   To embrace mercy is another thing altogether.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.700]   But maybe that's not the issue
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.000]   because you have a heart for lost people.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.540]   But I want you to think about the outworking
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.940]   of the sovereignty of God,
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.820]   not from a doctrinal perspective,
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.200]   but from a wisdom perspective.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.020]   Maybe the injustice on the television screen
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.820]   isn't bothering you because you know
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.380]   that God will set it all right,
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.860]   but what about when the injustice involves you,
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:27.820]   brother pastor?
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.420]   Have you been maligned?
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.540]   Have you been mistreated?
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.740]   Spoken ill of?
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.140]   Falsely accused?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.940]   How many Mondays have you thought,
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.560]   "Please throw me overboard"?
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:50.140]   Have you ever been on the brink of recapitulation, pastor?
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:55.900]   And you wondered, "God, why are you doing this?
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.860]   "I know what you're like,
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.060]   "but I don't like what you're doing in my life,
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.440]   "in our church, in this ministry."
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.620]   We can be very Jonah-like.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.900]   The trouble with Jonah continues in verse three.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:17.820]   His request is, yet again, he wants out.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.020]   He knows he can't run anymore,
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.180]   so he just says, "God,"
[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.140]   he actually is speaking to his own soul.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.020]   In the Hebrew, he says, "Soul, die."
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.220]   Just die.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.380]   He wants to be put out to pasture.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   He wants to be given his pink slip.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.460]   He's not interested in a severance package.
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.560]   He just wants to quit.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.840]   He wants Doge to come get rid of him.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.380]   He wants out of the prophetic business altogether.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.820]   It didn't work out for him.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.500]   He's spoiled now in his service to God.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.680]   He's done with grace.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.020]   He's done with compassion.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.580]   He's done with mercy.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.100]   The compassion of God has ruined Jonah's ministry,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.260]   and Jonah wants out.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:07.820]   Calvin here calls Jonah's request monstrous.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:14.540]   But how many ministers haven't felt this same weariness?
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.140]   The Apostle Paul knew we would feel this way
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.860]   when he penned to the Galatians.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.020]   "Don't grow weary in well-doing.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.100]   "In the proper time, you'll receive your harvest."
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.340]   God is more gracious than we are.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.000]   God is more compassionate than we are.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.960]   God is more pursuing than we are.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.740]   God is more loving than we are,
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.900]   and Jonah thinks God has gone too far in his mercy,
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.020]   and if only Jonah could see us here,
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.780]   bunch of Gentiles eating snacks all week
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.380]   with unwashed hands.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:57.300]   Gathered here, worshiping with very little regulations.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:02.100]   Goyim.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.120]   Jonah has no idea how far this would go.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.020]   It started with Nineveh.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.740]   It didn't actually start there.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.140]   It started with Rahab, and Rahab,
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.180]   and then all over the place.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.860]   There's a widow in Zarephath
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.300]   that gets her son resurrected,
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.500]   a leader of a pagan army named Nahum
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.820]   who's gonna be converted.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.140]   There's all these moments.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.180]   A Moabitess comes in, and not just into God's family,
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.020]   right into the Messianic line.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.420]   Joel's gonna prophesy about it,
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.940]   and then at Pentecost, the walls and the borders
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.100]   are all gonna break down,
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.220]   and God's gonna save all kinds of people
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.340]   that are disagreeable.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.060]   People that are different than you,
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.740]   look different than you, talk different than you,
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.220]   come from 10,000 different cultures and areas,
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.740]   speak different languages,
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.300]   because that's what God's mercy looks like.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.300]   It looks like God saving all kinds of people, bad people,
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.940]   because it's the only kind that needs saving.
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:05.460]   This is what God's mercy looks like.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.720]   God's gonna save people that you don't like,
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:14.380]   and people that don't like you, Pastor.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.660]   Amen.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.700]   And God is more gracious, more compassionate,
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.080]   more pursuing, more loving,
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.040]   and he will go too far in his mercy.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.240]   What about you?
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.040]   Do you underestimate the mercy of God as your default,
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.820]   seeing justice rather than grace?
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.160]   Because knowing sound theology isn't enough.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.120]   You have to embrace it and live it
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.220]   and get your heart like God's heart.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.780]   That's the outworking.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.860]   Jonah would have poured out a bowl of wrath on that city.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.020]   He would have delighted in God treating them that way,
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.100]   but God poured forth mercy,
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.740]   and right theology has to be mingled with a soft heart.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.760]   And what's so beautiful about this
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.580]   as we move into verses four through nine
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.220]   is there's a conversation in God's classroom.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.220]   God is going to do work on Jonah.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.620]   He's gonna take him to school.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.840]   He's got a tutorial, an object lesson,
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.380]   a one-on-one instructive parable of sorts,
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.700]   a little biblical counseling with props.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.460]   He's gonna put Jonah in a hut.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.580]   He's gonna homeschool him, hutschool him.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:27.660]   And that's scene two, a conversation in God's classroom.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.420]   Verse four, the Lord said,
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.100]   and if this isn't the grace of God, what is?
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.260]   He engages Jonah in a conversation at this point.
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.140]   That's incredible.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.600]   I mean, he could have just sent a big worm, just, oop.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:51.520]   But instead, he has a conversation
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.400]   with Jonah in his classroom.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.600]   Verse four, the Lord said,
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.540]   Yahweh said, do you have good reason to be angry?
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:00.440]   This passage is framed with verse nine
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.960]   asking the same question.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.200]   The object lesson that he teaches him is so clear here.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.480]   Verse nine of chapter four says,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.640]   God said to Jonah, do you have good reason
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.140]   to be angry about the plant?
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.880]   The object lesson that God demonstrates
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.840]   in his classroom for his prophet
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.040]   is framed by God's questions about the anger of Jonah.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.940]   God's first response to Jonah,
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.560]   do you have good reason to be angry?
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:25.160]   The NAS says, ESV, do you do well to be angry?
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   NLT, is it right for you to be angry?
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.080]   Do you have any right to be angry?
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.520]   Hebrew, rightly does it burn you?
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.040]   What a question, Ellison suggests this translation.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.920]   Are you sure you gauged the situation accurately?
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.660]   Yes.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.860]   How else can you describe a question?
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.060]   It's a further evidence of God's great compassion
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:51.000]   now directed towards his prophet once again,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.220]   proving what Jonah knew to be true about God,
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.980]   that God is gracious, that God is compassionate,
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.720]   that he is slow to anger, that he's abundant
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   in that loyal, faithful, unbreakable, affectionate love,
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.200]   and he relents concerning evil,
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.800]   and he does it right here, yet again,
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.640]   not just to the Ninevites, but to his servants.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:19.560]   Aren't you grateful that God doesn't smush you out
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.460]   when you think wrong and act wrong?
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:26.680]   He's merciful even to his prophet
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:32.720]   and proves that Jonah knew God truly as God is.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.140]   I marvel at this because God is still with Jonah.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.880]   He's not left him.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.160]   He still teaches Jonah.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.760]   He still converses with Jonah.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.320]   He's teaching Jonah about grace
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.080]   and simultaneously extending grace to Jonah
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.220]   as he builds his tantrum tent.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.040]   And he hopes to see God rain fire in the city.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.840]   The verbs in verse five are pluperfect.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.360]   It reads like this, "Jonah had gone out of the city
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.440]   "and had made a booth for himself there."
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.200]   Sulking in his hut.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.920]   And maybe, somebody asked me this question once.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.400]   Preaching the book of Jonah at a retreat,
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.520]   and they said, "How could you say that Jonah,
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.760]   "how could you say that Jonah was repentant
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.720]   "in the belly of the whale,
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.960]   "when in chapter four, he acts like this?"
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.520]   And I thought it was a good question,
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:30.880]   but it wasn't a difficult question for me
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.980]   'cause sometimes I act like this.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.980]   All the Christian life is repentance.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:45.500]   And after you repent, usually you have to repent some more.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.380]   Brian Estelle says it this way.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.340]   He says, "Jonah shows himself to be a man,
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:56.700]   "still in human skin, prone to wander,
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.020]   "and then inclined to give in to anger, despair,
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:04.580]   "and self-justification in spite of his transformation
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.940]   "in the fish."
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:10.580]   Be careful, brothers.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.020]   None of us are ever done growing, done learning.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.700]   We may have finished two years
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.540]   in the Tyrenaeus's lecture hall.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.220]   I don't think that's how you say it.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.460]   But we still need seminary.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.460]   We don't graduate from this one,
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.740]   not until life is through.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.460]   And the lordship of Christ doesn't mean
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.260]   his followers are sinless or perfect.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.420]   That's not what lordship means.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.780]   It means that they're in a master class of repentance.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:46.700]   That's why Luther said, "All of life is repentance."
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.220]   And Jonah, the repentant believer,
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.740]   the pouting prophet, is throwing a hot fit,
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.740]   builds his little hut out of whatever material
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.740]   he could find in the east desert outside of Nineveh,
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.420]   just images of Eden happening there
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.580]   as he expels himself from God's blessing.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.740]   You imagine this little meager shelter,
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.020]   and God takes occasion to do extreme home makeover
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.780]   and upgrades Jonah's little villa.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.180]   And it's all a tutorial on grace.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.500]   God appoints a plant,
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.100]   and this is all the meticulous sovereignty of God
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.700]   and Jonah appointing fish and appointing winds,
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.420]   and commentators get real scientific.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.300]   Is it a rinses plant or a castor oil plant?
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.220]   It's called a kikion plant.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.180]   Sinclair Ferguson calls it kiki.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:37.420]   Because it was so precious to Jonah.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.420]   It gave him shade.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.260]   He loved it.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.100]   It felt good.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.660]   This is a reminder that there are many prophets
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:47.460]   in God's economy who are bald.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:52.740]   (congregation laughing)
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.860]   I mean, otherwise it wouldn't have scorched his head
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.780]   if he had good hair.
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.660]   I don't think.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:07.700]   And he's loving the shade in this plant.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:12.500]   The verb matah, used for the fish,
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.700]   used for a plant, used to appoint the wind.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.100]   It's the sovereignty of God in this whole thing.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.460]   And I love how God constantly drives his people back
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.780]   to the big book of creation,
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.500]   the natural side of theology,
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.700]   the general revelation of God.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   He wants his people and his ministers saturated
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.300]   in this world that God made.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.380]   There's something that's a universal experience here
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   to be engaged with the beauty of creation in this moment,
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.540]   and God has shown us a panoply of this in Jonah
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.220]   with the ocean and the seafaring,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.300]   and now this strange supernatural plant that grows up
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.740]   and forms some beautiful covering for Jonah's shade
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.780]   and drops the temperature for him,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.820]   makes it nice and in comfort.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.340]   There's intervention here.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.980]   You couldn't have the book of Jonah
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.020]   without God's employment of his creation.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.460]   You couldn't have the message of Job
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.340]   without the theology of zoology
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.820]   that God employs for his believers
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:26.380]   to hear something from his big book that he made
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   to remind us that he is sovereign over creation,
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.740]   and this is what Jonah needed in this moment,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.580]   and his anger is a parable from the world,
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.580]   'cause Jonah isn't reading his Bible right now, I promise.
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:46.220]   And so he's out there in God's creation,
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.300]   part of the natural world.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.140]   I love that.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:55.140]   I love to read missionary biographies.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.420]   John G. Patton, missionary hero,
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.260]   great missionary in the New Hebrides.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.740]   He's the guy who was warned about,
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.380]   you'll be eaten by cannibals, the old man told him
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.940]   from the Presbyterian mission board,
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.700]   he responds with, "Mr. Dixon, we're all gonna be eaten
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.060]   "by worms, you first, 'cause you're old."
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.100]   That's a paraphrase.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:25.580]   48 years after the first missionaries were killed
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:29.340]   in the New Hebrides, John Patton would land on those islands
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.660]   and hundreds and hundreds of natives
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.740]   would be converted to Christ.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.580]   His ministry there was so difficult.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.300]   His wife died, he remarried.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.900]   It's just an incredible story.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.940]   And in his biography, you find so much
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.100]   of that creational theology.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.820]   The island he ministered on for all those years
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.700]   was soundly converted, it was called Ináhuac.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.460]   Ináhuac came to see the effect of Christianity.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.180]   And islanders from an adjacent island, Fortuna,
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.140]   came to see what Christianity looked like in Ináhuac,
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.980]   where he'd been ministering.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.540]   And he tells this story to brag on one of his preachers
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.860]   that he trained a native guy.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.900]   It's a beautiful story, I'll read you just a piece of it.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.260]   The day spring brought a large deputation from Fortuna,
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.700]   the other island not converted yet,
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.180]   to see for themselves the change
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.820]   which the gospel had produced on Ináhuac.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.740]   On Sabbath, the missionaries had conducted
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.220]   the usual public worship.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.860]   Some of the leading Ináhuans addressed the Fortunas
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.780]   as visitors and said to them, "Men of Fortuna,
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:34.020]   "you have come to see what the gospel has done for us."
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.740]   They called Patton Missy, missionary, Missy.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:44.880]   "You have come to see what the gospel has done for Ináhuac.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.920]   "It is Jehovah, living God, that has made all this change.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.460]   "As heathens, we quarreled and killed and ate each other.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.280]   "We had no peace and no joy in heart or house,
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.980]   "in the villages or in lands,
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.820]   "but we now live as brethren
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.500]   "and have happiness in all these things."
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.180]   When you go back to Fortuna and they ask you,
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.780]   "What is Christianity?"
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.660]   You'll have to reply, "It is that which changed the people
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.020]   "of Ináhuac," but they will still say,
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.860]   "What is it?"
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.860]   And you won't answer.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.140]   It's what that which has given them clothing
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.660]   and blankets and knives and axes and fish hooks
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.420]   and many other useful things.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.400]   It is that which has led them to give up fighting
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.940]   and to live together as friends,
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.700]   but they will ask you, "What is it like?"
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:26.360]   And you'll have to tell them, "Alas, you cannot explain it.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.340]   "You've only seen its workings, not itself,
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:30.320]   "that no one can tell what Christianity is,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.140]   "but the man that loves Jesus, the invisible master,"
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.340]   and walks with him and tries to please him.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.420]   "Now you people of Fortuna, you think that you don't dance
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.500]   "and you think that if you don't dance and sing
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.900]   "and pray to your gods, you will have no crops."
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.820]   It's about to get apologetic, hold on.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:49.940]   "You think you'll have no crops if you don't pray
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.500]   "and sing and dance to your gods.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.140]   "We once did so too, sacrificing and doing much abomination
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.880]   "to our gods for weeks before planting season every year,
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.960]   "but we saw our missy," missionary,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.640]   "only praying to the invisible Jehovah
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.280]   "and planting his yams.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:13.040]   "And they grew fairer than ours.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.860]   "You are weak every year before your hard work
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.540]   "begins in the fields with your wild and bad conduct
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.140]   "to please your gods, but we are strong for our work
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.020]   "for we pray to Jehovah and he gives us quiet rest
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.180]   "instead of wild dancing and it helps us
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.740]   "to be happy in our toils.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.640]   "Since we followed Missy's example,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.440]   "Jehovah has given to us a large and beautiful crop
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.060]   "and we now know that he gives us all our blessings."
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.220]   And then they turned to John Patton
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:42.460]   and this native preacher says to him,
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.300]   "Have you the large yam we presented to you?
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:50.200]   "Would you not think it well to send it back
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.660]   "with these men of Fortuna to let their people
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.860]   "see the yams which Jehovah grows for us
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.780]   "in answer to prayer?"
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.040]   Jehovah is the only God who can grow yams like that.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:09.820]   Yam apologetics, sweet potato theology.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.140]   It's a simple reminder that our God is God
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:18.420]   over all of nature, winds and waves and storms
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.020]   and sea creatures and sailors and Ninevites
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.800]   and the poor and a king and a vine and a worm
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.780]   and wind and yams and you, pastor,
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.280]   are part of God's creation.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.580]   And when we put ourselves in the realm we belong,
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.200]   little, little lower than the angels,
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.180]   made in the likeness and image of God,
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:46.460]   we can learn so much about our foolish perspective
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.260]   when we think ourselves more than creatures.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:54.460]   Thomas Brooks wrote that sweet message on assurance
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.260]   called "Heaven on Earth" and he has a list of arguments
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:58.900]   about assurance that I've used ministering
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.940]   to college students a bunch of times.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.860]   My favorite one is based on the Great Commission
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.400]   and general revelation.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.420]   He reminds the person wondering if they're truly saved
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:14.260]   that Jesus said, "Preach the gospel to all creatures,"
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.400]   Matthew 28, and his question is this,
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.900]   "Brother, are you among the rank of creatures?"
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:25.280]   That's a good one.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.840]   Do you qualify for that when the gospel's for you?
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.660]   Only Yahweh can grow yams like that.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.780]   Only Yahweh can grow a plant like this
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:41.780]   to demonstrate the sovereign nature of God's pure grace.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:46.420]   And when you see your entire life as grace,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.380]   that everything that you have is owed to God,
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.860]   that you are part of God's demonstrating his glory,
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:57.060]   in creation, he gives Jonah this object lesson
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.580]   that should be real to every pastor
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.500]   who needs to leave his study for a few minutes
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.900]   and go outside and look at the sky.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.140]   Not directly at the sun, but look at the sky.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.140]   And you'll receive from God a gift
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.760]   of being part of his wonderful creation.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:22.420]   And this plant grows up and Jonah's mad
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.260]   when it dies.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:29.060]   So mad, he demands death yet again.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.940]   He's God appoints that scorching wind
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:33.380]   and the sun beats down on Jonah's bald head
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:36.540]   and he becomes faint and begs with his soul to die.
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.940]   Better to me is death than life.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.860]   One commentator says this,
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.860]   "He does not object to the divine compassion
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.540]   "and salvation directed to those like himself,
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.300]   "but when it's also effective for the wicked,
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.200]   "he cannot abide it.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.380]   "Yet he is unwilling to live without his old belief
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.020]   "and because he refuses to let Yahweh
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.140]   "transform his anger into love,
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.420]   "his pity for plants into the pity for people,
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.140]   "his compassion of what the object of divine mercy
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.860]   "ought to be into what Yahweh has shown him
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:09.340]   "it actually is, he desperately longs to die."
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:13.340]   And that's because Jonah didn't understand grace.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.820]   Grace says that everything we have is from God,
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.340]   not from our earnings, not from our dessert.
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:26.220]   We have what we have because of the incredible grace of God
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:30.640]   and that includes oxygen and shade and salvation.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.780]   The Lord preserves sailors in Jonah
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.260]   and then he destroys the plant.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.860]   Emphatic pronouns in verse 10 and 11,
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.300]   the Lord said, "You had compassion on the plant
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.140]   "for which you did not work
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.140]   "and which you did not cause to grow.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.900]   "It came up overnight and perished overnight."
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.820]   And now we see finally the challenge in God's question.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:01.700]   He makes one of these call Yomer arguments,
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.580]   these heavy to light arguments.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.860]   God's trying to do a lesser to a greater here.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.060]   You have compassion on photosynthesis and chlorophyll,
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.620]   stems and leaves rather than on a people.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:18.020]   And he's pressing Jonah towards this concluding question,
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:23.020]   this logical inference, a contrast of value, a comparison.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   And all the emphasis is on God's freedom
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.880]   to act in compassion.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.780]   His classroom is a classroom of grace.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.700]   His character is marked by mercy.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.580]   And now the challenge is,
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.700]   how are you going to respond to this reality?
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.980]   Is Jonah gonna keep haystacking at this city
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:49.300]   until it finally ceases to exist?
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:55.220]   Or is he going to see the heart of God
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:00.500]   for his creation that has inherent dignity
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.860]   because they're made in his likeness and image?
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:08.100]   And you have a theological Copernican revolution
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.380]   and recognize that he's not the center of this,
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.500]   but that God is, and he needs to fix his eyes
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.700]   on the glory of God.
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.580]   And God is doing whatever he pleases in this world.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.040]   He's having mercy on whom he'll have mercy.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.980]   This is the exact truth that Paul wrestles with
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.460]   in Romans 9 through 11.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.300]   He'll be gracious to him, he'll be gracious.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.700]   He'll show compassion to him, he'll show compassion.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.140]   Jonah, can you get in line?
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.420]   Grace insists on the freedom of God
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.820]   to do what he wills to do,
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:40.020]   and that's why it's called sovereign grace.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.940]   God is a God of compassion, and we see it here in Jonah,
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.620]   but Jonah doesn't see it yet.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:52.060]   Two things to conclude here.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:57.720]   One, this isn't the end of the story.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:03.300]   Not for this prophet from a region
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.860]   that would come back into focus.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.780]   You see, there's another young man
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.140]   who will grow up in the same region.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.380]   It'll be called Galilee.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:21.500]   He'll never sin, he'll never rebel.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.380]   He'll be a spokesman on behalf of God as well.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.860]   And the people that see this young man
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.500]   who takes on the name of that great leader
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.560]   that followed Moses, Yeshua,
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.380]   they'll see in Jesus the tremendous authority
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.940]   as he speaks on behalf of God.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.620]   And he too will cry out for people to repent,
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.380]   much like his forerunner Jonah did.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.500]   And two times in the lips of the Lord,
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.500]   he'll reference Jonah in his tomb of death
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.940]   as a prophecy of his work to come.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.860]   And the people who will see this Galilean
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.660]   will see something they never saw in Jonah
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.540]   because the compassion of God
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.140]   is seen most clearly in his son.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:06.180]   "He will personify," Jonah 2.9,
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.020]   "salvation comes from the Lord."
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.940]   And the one who brought salvation
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.500]   also brings with him tremendous compassion
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.220]   as he stretches out his hands and touches people
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:19.220]   and says like, "I am willing to be cleansed."
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:25.820]   As he reaches out and ministers to complete social pariahs,
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:29.640]   touching the untouchable, including these outsiders,
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:34.960]   saving sinners and vile tax collectors.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.460]   People would throw rocks at lepers
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.540]   and tell them to stay away.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.420]   And Jesus would move freely among them
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:46.200]   in compassion to heal them.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.780]   He'd look at vast crowds of people,
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.820]   the son of man would, and he would see all these people,
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.540]   Matthew 14, 14, and Jesus felt compassion for them
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.140]   because they were distressed
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.420]   and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.060]   And Jesus would go to areas that were unclean,
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.580]   like Gennesaret, and find a demonic man
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.940]   and change him from the inside out
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.460]   and commission him to go with compassion
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.660]   on the 10 Gentile cities.
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:14.380]   And Jesus would find a widow that needed healing
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.260]   just like Elijah did way back when.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.460]   And Jesus would extend mercy to a dying child
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:23.420]   and restore that precious one to the family.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.060]   And Jesus would touch the eyes of the blind
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.100]   and they would immediately regain their sight.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.980]   And he would sit up on that hill overlooking Jerusalem
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.580]   and the son of man would weep and he would say,
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.100]   "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.220]   "and stones those who sent her?
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.300]   "How often I wanted to gather your children together
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.740]   "like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.180]   "and you are unwilling."
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:49.460]   The magnificent compassion throughout the ministry of Jesus
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.220]   is brought into focus as he is a prophet
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.640]   from this same place that Jonah was.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:00.580]   Feeling compassion on large crowds preaching the gospel
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.180]   to lost people in their sins.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.660]   And the Bible tells us that Jesus expressed continually
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:10.540]   the compassion of God, both in emotion and in action.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:14.260]   And God's love and his deep display is impacted
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.620]   as God sends his son to a lost world.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.580]   First to the lost sheep of Israel,
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.740]   and then as he commissions his followers,
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.460]   that mission expands far beyond the borders
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:26.380]   from Jerusalem to Judea, to Samaria,
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.740]   to the uttermost parts of the earth.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.340]   And all of that is reminding us
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.780]   that God is a God of compassion.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.020]   There is no missionary endeavor to any unreached people
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.300]   that goes beyond God's compassion,
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.180]   God's massive capacity for compassion,
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:43.900]   because God is more merciful than you think he is.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:46.340]   He's more gracious than you think he is.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.740]   And if you really understood the holiness of God
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.980]   and the sinful depravity of our own hearts,
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.900]   you would begin to recognize the depth of God's mercy
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.420]   that is far beyond our comprehension.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:01.300]   When is God too compassionate for your tastes?
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.820]   Are there people or nations
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.000]   that you believe to be beyond his mercy?
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.660]   Homosexuals, ISIS, liberals.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.700]   How do we limit God's compassion?
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:16.740]   Have we confused the doctrine of election for elitism?
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.900]   Because God's compassion is stunning,
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.540]   and he will stun you with it.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:25.380]   His mercy is overwhelming, and Jonah was overwhelmed by it.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.860]   And as Jesus's ministry unfolded,
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.980]   the compassion of God is seen most clearly
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:34.860]   on the cross of Christ as he forgave those who crucified him
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.500]   and knew that his disciples would take the message
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.940]   of the one who gave his life
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:42.860]   for the sins of all who would believe in their place.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.500]   Don't question the character of God
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.060]   because his justice is clearly displayed
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.940]   with his sovereignty on the cross of Christ,
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.020]   a place of enormous and extraordinary
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.560]   and eternally lasting compassion.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:00.260]   And secondly, without a scribal note to guide us
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:03.660]   at the end of Jonah, what happened to Jonah?
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.740]   Did Jonah get it?
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.500]   I think he did.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.300]   Because where else in the world
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.060]   did we get the book of Jonah from?
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.340]   I think Jonah wrote it.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.700]   I think the Worm wrote it.
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:27.220]   Who else was on that blistering, hot field that day?
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:32.340]   And I think something happened after this confrontation.
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.260]   I think Jonah had to tell his story.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:39.100]   And I think that all biblical writers, he told it straight.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.700]   He told it honest, he penned it right.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.200]   I think Jonah came around.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.540]   And if you've ever questioned the character of God
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.380]   and it's outworking in your life and ministry,
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.300]   his justice, his sovereign plan,
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.220]   if you've ever thought God wasn't there,
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.380]   that he hadn't been generous or he wasn't good,
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.580]   ground your faith in the reality
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.260]   that we've learned from this book.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.460]   Become a willing prophet or teacher.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.380]   Once you're persuaded, Calvin says,
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.540]   that God truly is merciful.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.900]   And I think Jonah became persuaded that God is merciful.
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.020]   And I think that's why he wrote this book.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:17.460]   And I think the unbreakable logic of God
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.420]   lined Jonah's heart to God's heart.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:24.420]   And I think if you pursue that same heart of God
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.840]   and compassion, it can happen in your life and ministry too.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.740]   One missionary realized this named J. Verkeel
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.780]   writing in a book called The Biblical Foundation
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.060]   of the Worldwide Missions Mandate.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.260]   He learned something from Jonah
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.620]   and he comments on this final line.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.340]   And Jonah stalked to his shaded seat
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:52.260]   and waited for God to come around to his way of thinking.
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:57.380]   And God is still waiting for a host of Jonah's
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.220]   in their comfortable houses
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:04.660]   to come around to his way of loving.
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:10.500]   Go into all the world and preach the gospel.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.820]   Show them the compassion and love of God in Christ.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:18.820]   And never forget that God saves wicked people like us.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:22.020]   Can we trust that God is doing it
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:25.660]   when we don't understand what he's up to?
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.980]   Can we sit in his classroom as he shapes us and works on us?
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:34.020]   And can we have a heart become like the heart of our Lord,
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.660]   a heart that loves sinners?
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.300]   Have compassion on the lost and prove it.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.380]   Tell them about Jesus.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:46.820]   Father, thank you for sending Christ to be a blessing
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.460]   to all the people of the earth.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.260]   Remove our narrowness, our rigidness, our resistance.
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.940]   Make us eager to see the unfolding
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.380]   of your compassion to lost people.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.860]   We thank you, God, for the message of Jonah,
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.420]   a message that's unforgettable
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:05.740]   because it puts on us your extraordinary compassion.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.020]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.860]   (water trickling)
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.700]   (water trickling)
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.540]   (water trickling)
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.600]   you
