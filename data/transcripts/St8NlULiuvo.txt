[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440]   - APJ listeners, hello, this is Tony.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.880]   Today's episode is very different
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.240]   than anything we've done on the podcast.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.960]   This episode is actually an audio book,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.920]   two hours long, the full thing.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.780]   John Piper just wrote this urgent and timely book.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.940]   It's titled "Coronavirus and Christ."
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.600]   The e-book is available online right now
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   at DesiringGod.org, and the paperback edition
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.520]   can be ordered online right now as well.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.080]   This book is made possible because of our incredibly
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.520]   generous financial partners here at Desiring God.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760]   Thank you for making our work possible,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.880]   especially so in this challenging season.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.040]   It's also made possible because Crossway Books,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.160]   our publishing partner, is getting behind this book
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.940]   in a big way to enable us to fast track it
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.280]   into multiple channels and to get a print version
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.200]   published quickly.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.520]   Pastor John recorded the audio book from his home,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.920]   and we wanted you APJ listeners to get this
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.840]   as soon as possible.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.320]   We hope it ministers to you as you find ways
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   to share this episode with your friends,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.040]   your family, and your church.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.720]   Here now is Pastor John.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.320]   - Desiring God presents the audio edition
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.040]   of "Coronavirus and Christ" by John Piper,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.520]   narrated by John Piper.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.960]   For additional resources, visit DesiringGod.org.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.960]   The occasion, coronavirus.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.520]   I am writing this little book in the last days
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.040]   of March 2020 on the front end of the global pandemic
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.680]   known as the coronavirus, or technically
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.680]   Coronavirus Disease 2019, abbreviated COVID-19.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.920]   The virus affects the lungs, and in the worst cases,
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.540]   kills by suffocation.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.300]   The first death by the virus was reported in China
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.580]   on January 11, 2020.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.940]   Today, as I write, there are hundreds of thousands
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.560]   of cases of infection worldwide,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.820]   with tens of thousands of deaths.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.780]   There is no known cure, yet.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.900]   By the time you read this, you will know far better
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.240]   than I how things will develop,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.920]   so I need not detail the measures being taken
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.420]   to slow the spread of the virus,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.340]   or the economic toll being exacted.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.580]   Social mingling, travel, conferences,
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.260]   church gatherings, theaters, restaurants,
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.260]   sporting events, and businesses are nearing a standstill.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.460]   This is not unprecedented, either globally or in America.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.540]   In the global influenza epidemic of 1918,
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.740]   to use the estimates of the Centers for Disease Control,
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.880]   50 million people around the world died.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.520]   Over 500,000 of those were in the United States.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.760]   People felt symptoms in the morning,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.320]   and were dead by nightfall.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.960]   Bodies were picked up from front porches
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.340]   to be carted away to graves dug by bulldozers.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.560]   A man was shot for not wearing a mask.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.240]   Schools were closed.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.520]   Ministers spoke of Armageddon.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.880]   Of course, precedents prove nothing.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.160]   The past is warning, not fate.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.120]   Nevertheless, this is a time when the fragile form
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.520]   of this world is felt.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   The seeming solid foundations are shaking.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.620]   The question we should be asking is,
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.400]   do we have a rock under our feet?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.460]   A rock that cannot be shaken, ever.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:55.740]   Part One, The God Who Reigns Over the Coronavirus
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.140]   Chapter One, Come to the Rock
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.740]   I am moved to write because playing the odds
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.700]   is a fragile place to put your hope.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.300]   Odds like 3% versus 10%,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.700]   youth versus old age,
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.380]   compromised health versus no history of disease,
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.620]   rural versus urban,
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.820]   self-isolated versus meeting with friends.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.060]   Playing the odds provides little hope.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.860]   It's not a firm place to stand.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.020]   There is a better way.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.580]   There is a better place to stand,
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.580]   a rock of certainty rather than the sand of probabilities.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.060]   When Cancer Came
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.380]   I recall being told on December 21, 2005,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.380]   that I had prostate cancer.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.980]   For the next several weeks,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.700]   all the talk was about odds,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.540]   odds with waiting to see,
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.940]   odds with medications,
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.340]   odds with homeopathic procedures,
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.980]   odds with radical surgery.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.260]   My wife, Noelle, and I took these numbers seriously.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.620]   But in the evening, we would smile at each other and think,
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.340]   "Our hope is not in odds.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.340]   Our hope is in God."
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.780]   We did not mean,
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.140]   "It is 100% certain God will heal me,
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.580]   while doctors can only give me odds."
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.580]   The rock we are talking about is better than that.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.020]   Yes, better than healing.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.660]   Even before the phone call from the doctor telling me I had cancer,
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.820]   God had already reminded me in a remarkable way
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.380]   about the rock under my feet.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.460]   After my usual annual exam,
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.580]   the urologist had looked at me and said,
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.300]   "I'd like to do a biopsy."
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.140]   "Really?" I thought.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.660]   "When?"
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.980]   "Right now, if you have time."
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.900]   "I'll make time."
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.980]   While he was going to get the machine
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.340]   and while I was changing into the typical unflattering blue gown,
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.340]   there was time for me to ponder what was happening.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.900]   So, he thinks I may have cancer.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.100]   As my future in this world began to change before my eyes,
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.780]   God brought to my mind something I had read recently in the Bible.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.580]   God spoke.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.180]   Now, let's be clear.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.940]   I don't hear voices.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.620]   At least I never have.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.060]   My confidence that God speaks is rooted in the fact
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.180]   that the Bible is the Word of God.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.420]   More on that in the next chapter.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.820]   He has spoken once for all,
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.620]   and he still speaks in his Word.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.420]   The Bible, rightly understood, is the voice of God.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.060]   Here's what he said to me in that urologist's office
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.620]   as I waited for the biopsy that would confirm that I had cancer.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.140]   "John Piper, this is not wrath.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.580]   Live or die, you will be with me."
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.940]   That's my paraphrase.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.340]   Here's what he actually said.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.140]   "God has not destined us for wrath,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.900]   but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.820]   who died for us,
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.940]   so that whether we are awake or asleep,
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.780]   we might live with him."
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.540]   1 Thessalonians 5, 9-10.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.060]   Wake or sleep.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.260]   That is, live or die, I will be alive with God.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.700]   How can that be?
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.820]   I am a sinner.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.700]   I have never lived a day of my life,
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.660]   not one, without falling short of God's standards of love and holiness.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.100]   So how can this be?
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.020]   How can God say, "You, John Piper, will be with me.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.700]   Live or die."
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.900]   God didn't even wait for the question before he answered.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.180]   It's because of Jesus.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.060]   Jesus alone.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.380]   Because of his death, there will be no wrath toward me.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.060]   Not because of my perfection.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:11.820]   My sins, my guilt, and my punishment fell on my Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.020]   He died for us.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.300]   That's what his Word says.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.700]   Therefore, I am free from guilt, free from punishment,
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.820]   secure in God's merciful favor.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.740]   Live or die, God said, you will be with me.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.140]   That is very different from playing the odds with cancer or with the coronavirus.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.820]   This is a firm rock under my feet.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.180]   It is not fragile.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.500]   It is not sand.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.180]   I would like it to be a rock under your feet.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.420]   That is why I am writing.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.980]   Is the rock solid only in the by and by?
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.340]   But that's not all.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:07.900]   Someone might read that and say, "Religious people like you can find hope only in the by and by.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.500]   If they are safe beyond the grave, they have what they want."
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:17.820]   But this voice of God they talk about offers little involvement right now.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.820]   God got everything started in creation, I suppose, and makes happily ever after endings.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.060]   But what about in between?
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.300]   Where is he now?
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.580]   Right now, during this coronavirus outbreak?
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:42.060]   Well, I guess I do put a really high value on joy in the presence of God after death
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:47.580]   for unending billions of years, as opposed to, say, endless suffering.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.060]   That seems reasonable to me.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.940]   But the rock under my feet, the one I would like you to share,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.940]   really is under my feet now.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.160]   Now.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.900]   The coronavirus pandemic is where I live, where we all live.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.940]   And if it weren't the coronavirus, it would be the cancer just waiting to recur,
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:17.820]   or the unprovoked pulmonary embolism of 2014 just waiting to break off and go to my brain
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.500]   and turn me into a mindless man who will never write another sentence,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.900]   or a hundred other unforeseen calamities that could take me and you down at any moment.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.860]   The rock I'm talking about is under my feet now.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:41.260]   I could say that the rock is under my feet now just because hope beyond the grave is present hope.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.380]   The object of hope is future.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.780]   The experience of hope is present.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.060]   And that present experience is powerful.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.740]   Hope is power.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.740]   Present power.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.380]   Hope keeps people from killing themselves.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.440]   Now.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.500]   It helps people get out of bed and go to work.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.000]   Now.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.820]   It gives meaning to daily life, even locked down, quarantined, stay-at-home life.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.880]   Now.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.020]   It liberates from selfishness and fear and greed.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.740]   Now.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.340]   It empowers love and risk-taking and sacrifice.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.640]   Now.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.820]   So be careful before you belittle the by and by.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.340]   It just may be that when your by and by is beautiful and sure,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.940]   your here and now will be sweet and fruitful.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.180]   His finger in viruses.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:47.740]   That's what I could say in defense of God's sweet word to me in the urologist's office.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.580]   Live or die, you will be with me.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:55.660]   Such hope through the death and resurrection of Jesus makes me want to pour out my life
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.980]   for the good of others now, especially their eternal good.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.740]   It makes me passionate not to waste my life.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.660]   It takes away dithering.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.460]   It fills me with a zeal to make the greatness of Jesus Christ known.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:17.580]   It makes me want to spend and be spent to bring as many people with me as I can into everlasting joy.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.340]   But even though that's what I could say,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.340]   when someone objects that Piper's God specializes in the by and by, not the here and now,
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.980]   it's not the only thing that needs to be said.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.020]   In fact, what I'm about to say will probably make someone object,
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.900]   "Whoa, that's way too much involvement for God in the here and now.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:45.660]   Now you've gone from a God who only fixes the future to a God with his fingers in viruses."
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.420]   Not, "I'm fine," but, "I feel fine."
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.460]   Let's put it this way.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.460]   People would often ask me before my cancer diagnosis,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.060]   "How's your health?"
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.740]   And I would answer, "Fine."
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.100]   I don't answer that way anymore.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.780]   I say, "I feel fine.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.700]   There's a difference."
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.020]   The day before I went for that annual prostate exam, I felt fine.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.180]   The day after, I was told I had cancer.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.900]   In other words, I was not fine.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:29.500]   So even as I write these words, I do not know if I am fine.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.100]   I feel fine, way better than I deserve.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:40.060]   For all I know, I have cancer right now, or perhaps a blood clot, or the coronavirus.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.500]   What's the point?
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.420]   The point is this.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:52.780]   The ultimate reason we ought not to say, "I am fine," is that God alone knows and decides
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.020]   if you are fine.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:04.540]   Now, to say, "I am fine," when you don't know if you are fine and you don't control if you
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.740]   are fine, is like saying, "Tomorrow I will go to Chicago and do business there," when you
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:15.260]   have no idea if you will even be alive tomorrow, let alone doing business in Chicago.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.580]   Here's what the Bible says about a sentence like that.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:26.780]   "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.820]   a year there and trade and make a profit,' yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.420]   What is your life?
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.500]   For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:47.820]   Instead, you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.'"
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.780]   James 4, 13-15.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.260]   So the God who is involved only in the by and by just evaporated.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:04.620]   That's the effect of the bright sunlight of biblical truth on the ephemeral mists of our
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.260]   opinions.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   If he decides, we do this or that.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:20.940]   The rock I stand on and want you to stand on is the rock of God's action in the world now
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.540]   and forever.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.300]   "If the Lord wills," the Bible says, "we will live."
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.020]   That's about as involved now as you can get.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:40.060]   Not just whether you live or die, you will be with God, but also God will decide if you
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.500]   live or die now.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.700]   And not just live or die.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.620]   He's even more involved than that.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.500]   "If the Lord wills, we will do this or that."
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:59.020]   Nothing is excluded from this or that.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.380]   He is totally involved.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.740]   Totally.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:13.980]   This health or that sickness, this economic collapse or that recovery, this breath or not.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:21.900]   Which means that while I waited in the doctor's office for the biopsy machine to arrive,
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.580]   God could have said, which he did later, "Fear not.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.660]   Whether you live or die, you will be with me.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.660]   And in the meantime, while you live, nothing will happen to you.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.460]   Nothing that I do not appoint.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.140]   If I decide, you will live.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.140]   If I decide, you will die.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:51.820]   And until you die at my decision, I will decide if you do this or that.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.660]   Get to work.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.700]   This is my rock for today, tomorrow, and eternity."
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.580]   Come to the rock.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:09.900]   This book is my invitation for you to join me on the solid rock, Jesus Christ.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.140]   What that means, will, I hope, become clear.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:21.500]   My aim is to show why God in Christ is the rock at this moment in history,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:30.620]   in this pandemic of the coronavirus, and what it is like to stand on his mighty love.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:36.060]   Chapter 2, A Solid Foundation
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:43.580]   It matters little what I think about the coronavirus, or anything else for that matter.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.900]   But it matters forever what God thinks.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.940]   He is not silent about what he thinks.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.980]   Scarcely a page in the Bible is irrelevant for this crisis.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.340]   Solid and Sweet
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.540]   My voice is grass.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.180]   God's voice is granite.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.260]   The grass withers and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.060]   1 Peter 1 24-25
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.500]   Jesus said that God's words in Scripture cannot be broken.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.340]   John 10 35
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.820]   What God says is true and righteous, altogether.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.180]   Psalm 19 9
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.060]   His word is, therefore, a firm foundation for life.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.820]   You have founded your testimonies forever.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.020]   Psalm 119 152
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.100]   Listening to God and believing him is like building your house on a rock,
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.100]   not on sand.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.780]   Matthew 7 24
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.820]   His word is the kind of counsel you want to heed.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.140]   He is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.460]   Isaiah 28 29
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.420]   His understanding is beyond measure.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   Psalm 147 5
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:10.300]   When he gives counsel about the coronavirus, it is firm, unshakable, lasting.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.500]   The counsel of the Lord stands forever.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.660]   Psalm 33 11
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   His way is perfect.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.380]   2 Samuel 22 31
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.180]   Therefore, his words are sweet and precious.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.420]   More to be desired are they than gold, sweeter also than honey,
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.740]   and drippings from the honeycomb.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.580]   Psalm 19 10
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.220]   Indeed, they are the sweetness of everlasting life.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.140]   Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.140]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.740]   John 6 68
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:55.820]   Therefore, in the best and worst of times, God's words bring unshakable peace and joy.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.380]   Surely it must be so.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:05.260]   My prayer is that all who read this book would share the experience of the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.300]   Your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.860]   Jeremiah 15 16
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:22.220]   And mark this, the sweetness of God's Word is not lost in this historic moment of bitter providence,
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.820]   not if we have learned the secret of sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.500]   2 Corinthians 6 10
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.580]   We will see more fully later what this secret is,
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.540]   but here it is now in a single sentence.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.500]   The secret of sorrowful yet always rejoicing is this,
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:48.620]   knowing that the same sovereignty that could stop the coronavirus yet doesn't
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.740]   is the very sovereignty that sustains the soul in it.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.940]   Indeed, more than sustains, sweetens.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:06.940]   Sweetens with hope that God's purposes are kind, even in death, for those who trust him.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.580]   How do you know?
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.300]   All the more urgent, therefore, is the question,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.940]   how do you know that the Bible is the Word of God?
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:23.500]   My short answer is that there is a divine glory that shines through it,
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:29.260]   which fits perfectly with the God-shaped template in your heart.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:38.300]   Like sprocket and gear, hand and glove, fish and water, wings and air,
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.140]   the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:48.700]   To which I can imagine someone saying, "That sounds sort of mystical and subjective."
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.020]   Why do you answer like that?
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:58.060]   Because 50 years ago, when I was struggling to know what I should build my life on,
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.900]   I realized that the scholarly, historical arguments for the Bible
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.340]   would not work for most people of the world.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.540]   Why?
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:16.620]   Because while true and helpful to a point, they cannot be followed by an eight-year-old child,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:22.540]   a newly encountered preliterate villager in a remote South Pacific jungle,
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.180]   or an ordinary person in the West with little formal education,
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.820]   and yet it seemed obvious to me that God intended for such people
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.300]   to hear the Word of God and believe without leaping into the dark.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.460]   Biblical faith is not a leap in the dark.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.500]   The biblical view of faith is not a leap in the dark.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.980]   It is warranted and well-grounded.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.860]   It's called faith not because it has no foundation.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.700]   It's called faith because it involves trust.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.780]   Jesus didn't call the believers blind.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.740]   He called the unbelievers blind.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.980]   "Seeing they do not see," Matthew 13:13.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:15.180]   Saving faith in God's Word is based on seeing—real seeing.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.100]   Seeing what?
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.660]   The Bible answers like this.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:29.980]   "Satan does all he can to blind the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:36.380]   of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God," 2 Corinthians 4:4.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:44.780]   In other words, there is a kind of spiritual light that shines through the gospel,
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.420]   the biblical story of salvation.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.820]   What kind of light?
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.660]   It's the light of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.660]   This is not magical.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.300]   It's not mystical in the sense of something appearing that is not really there.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:10.860]   Jesus Christ is the kind of divine human person whose moral and spiritual and supernatural
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:17.500]   glory—his beauty and worth and greatness—shines through God's Word.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:24.860]   It authenticates Scripture as true, God-shaped template in your soul.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:34.060]   This is why I say there is a divine glory that shines through the Scriptures that fits perfectly
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.100]   with the God-shaped template in your heart.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:42.380]   In that way, it authenticates the truth and value of the Bible.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:52.300]   Yes, I do believe that there is a God-shaped template, a kind of indirect knowledge of God
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   in every human soul.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.580]   The Bible puts it like this.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:02.540]   Speaking of all humanity, it says, "What can be known about God is plain to them.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:11.580]   Although they knew God, they did not honor him as God," Romans 1, 19 and 21.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:20.140]   The Bible teaches that this knowing in every soul makes us all responsible to see the glory
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.660]   of God in nature.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.940]   In the same way, we are all responsible to see the glory of God in Jesus through the Word.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.580]   The heavens declare the glory of God, Psalm 19.1.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.300]   We are obliged to see it and give thanks.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:41.260]   So also the Son of God displays the glory of God, and we are responsible to see it and
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.780]   worship it.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.260]   The Apostle John says, "We have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father,"
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.540]   John 1, 14.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:59.420]   This is the self-authenticating glory that shines from God's Word and gives us a warranted,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.100]   well-grounded foundation for believing that the Christian Scriptures are from God.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:13.420]   Technology vs. Taste The way we come to know the glory of God
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:19.820]   in Scripture is similar to the way we know that honey is honey.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:27.500]   Science and technology may say that this jar contains honey because of chemical experiments,
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:33.580]   just like biblical scholars can argue compellingly that the Bible is historically reliable.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.020]   But most people are not scientists or scholars.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.580]   We know that this is honey because we taste it.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:50.780]   Similarly, there is a divine sweetness in the glory of God in the message of the Bible.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.980]   It touches a part of us that we know was put there by God.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.820]   How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.380]   Psalm 119, 103.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.220]   Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.580]   Psalm 34, 8.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.580]   This is a real seeing and tasting.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.340]   It is not make-believe.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.740]   It sees and tastes what is really there.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.060]   Yes to the rock of our comfort.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:30.380]   So when Jesus says, "Scripture cannot be broken," John 10, 35,
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:38.620]   and when the Apostle Paul says, "All Scripture is breathed out by God," 2 Timothy 3, 16,
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:45.420]   and when the Apostle Peter says, "The authors of Scripture were carried along by the Holy Spirit,"
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:52.220]   2 Peter 1, 21, our heart says, "Yes, we have tasted and seen.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.460]   We know, and the knowing is well founded.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.860]   We are not leaping in the dark."
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:07.020]   Our whole soul resonates with the biblical shout, "The sum of your word is truth."
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.100]   Psalm 119, 160.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.460]   Forever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.540]   Psalm 119, 89.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.940]   Every word of God proves true.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.700]   Psalm 30, verse 5.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:27.500]   When this happens, the whole truth of God washes over us, even in the face of the coronavirus.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.300]   It comes with incomparable comfort.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:35.980]   When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.900]   Psalm 94, 19.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.580]   The Lord is near the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.140]   Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.260]   but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.500]   Psalm 34, 18 to 19.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.540]   No man can comfort our souls in this pandemic the way God can.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.660]   His comfort is unshakable.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:05.180]   It is the comfort of a great high rock on the stormy sea.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.460]   It comes from his word, the Bible.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.260]   Chapter 3.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.460]   The rock is righteous.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.660]   If God is going to be our rock, he must be righteous.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   An unrighteous rock is a mirage.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:31.740]   The very thing that a global pandemic shakes is our confidence that God is righteous, holy, good.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.700]   If God is not righteous in the midst of it, we have no rock.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:45.180]   So we need to ask, what is the holiness and righteousness of God?
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.980]   What is the righteousness and goodness of God?
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.060]   Because if we don't know what they are,
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.780]   how will we know if this coronavirus outbreak has made them crumble?
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:06.140]   Or how will we know if instead they are the eternal foundations of the rock that saves us?
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:15.100]   The Bible portrays the holiness, righteousness, and goodness of God not as identical,
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.340]   but as interlocking.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.380]   We start with God's holiness.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.820]   What is it?
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.460]   Transcendent, infinite worth.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:35.340]   The root meaning of the Old Testament word for holiness is the idea of being separate,
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.500]   different, separated from the ordinary.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:46.380]   And when applied to God, this separateness implies that he is in a class by himself.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:52.540]   He is like a one-of-a-kind diamond, supremely valuable.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:58.220]   We can use the word transcendent for this kind of divine separateness.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:05.340]   He is so uniquely separate that he transcends all other reality.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.620]   He is above it and more valuable than all of it.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:15.900]   When Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it the way God said, God rebuked him.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:24.940]   "You did not believe in me to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel."
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.780]   Numbers 20, verse 12.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:34.220]   In other words, Moses treated God not as exceptional and supremely trustworthy,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.700]   but as just another human authority along with the others that could be ignored.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:46.860]   Or in Isaiah 8, 12 to 13, God said to Isaiah, "Do not fear what this people fears,
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:54.220]   nor be in dread, but the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.540]   Let him be your fear.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.900]   Let him be your dread."
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:05.180]   In other words, don't lump God into the same group as all your ordinary fears and dreads.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:13.820]   Treat him as an utterly separate and unique, a transcendent fear and dread.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:23.740]   Therefore, God's holiness is his infinite transcendence and worth above all else.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:30.700]   He is in a class by himself, which means he doesn't depend on anything else for his existence.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.940]   He is self-existent, so he needs nothing and depends on nothing.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.940]   He is complete, perfect.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:47.260]   Therefore, he possesses the greatest value as the source of all reality and all value.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.660]   Above all, but not solitary.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:02.780]   God's infinite height above all other reality does not mean that he is a loveless, solitary mind.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:09.100]   The historic doctrine of the Trinity is biblical through and through.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:18.940]   God exists as three divine persons, but these three are one, one divine essence.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:28.700]   There is one God, not three, but this one God exists in a mysterious and true unity
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:38.380]   of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, each of them eternal and without beginning, each of them truly God.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:48.460]   So the holiness, the transcendent worth and greatness of God does not mean he is solitary
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.860]   and loveless in his infinite height.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:57.500]   God the Father knows and loves the Son perfectly, completely.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:07.820]   Mark 1.11, Mark 9.7, Colossians 1.13, God the Son knows and loves the Father perfectly,
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.500]   completely, infinitely, John 14.31.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:20.780]   The Holy Spirit is the perfect, complete, infinite expression of the Father's and the Son's
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.700]   knowledge and love of each other.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.940]   Why does this matter?
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:33.820]   Because this perfect Trinitarian fellowship is essential to the fullness and perfection
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.820]   and completeness of God.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:42.140]   It is essential to his transcendent worth and beauty and greatness.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.140]   That is, it is essential to his holiness.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:52.060]   Holiness is interlocking with righteousness.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:57.900]   There is a missing dimension in that description of God's holiness.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:05.020]   The Bible speaks of God's holiness not only in terms of transcendence, but also in terms
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.620]   of morality.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:14.860]   To be holy is not just to be separate and transcendent, but also to be righteous.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:21.500]   This forces a question that will have great implications for how we view the coronavirus
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.540]   in relation to God.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:30.860]   Since righteousness implies doing what is right, and doing what is right implies compliance
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:36.700]   with some standard of rightness, what standard does God's righteousness comply with?
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:42.220]   Before creation, there were no standards outside God.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.580]   There was nothing outside of him for him to comply with.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:50.780]   Before creation, God was the only reality.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:58.300]   So when there is only God, how do you define what is right for God to do?
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:06.540]   That is, how can God's holiness encompass not only his transcendence, but also his righteousness?
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:12.540]   The answer is that the standard of God's righteousness is God.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.900]   The foundational biblical principle is this.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.340]   He cannot deny himself, 2 Timothy 2.13.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:28.780]   He cannot act in a way that would deny his own infinite worth and beauty and greatness.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.020]   This is the standard of what is right for God.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:40.780]   This means that the moral dimension of God's holiness, his righteousness, is his unwavering
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.700]   commitment to act in accord with his worth and beauty and greatness.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:54.460]   Every affection, every thought, every word, every act of God will always be consistent
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.620]   with the infinite worth and beauty of his transcendent fullness.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:05.980]   If God were to deny his worth or beauty or greatness, it would not be right.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.020]   The ultimate standard would be broken.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.900]   He would be unrighteous.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.540]   Righteousness is interlocking with goodness.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:23.900]   The goodness of God is not identical with his holiness or his righteousness.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:31.500]   But it is interlocking in that his holiness overflows in goodness, and his righteousness
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.100]   guides its bestowal.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.820]   They never contradict each other.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:43.900]   God's goodness is his disposition to be generous, to do what blesses human beings.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:51.820]   The transcendent fullness and perfection of God, his holiness, is like a fountain that
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.620]   overflows.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.900]   This is why he is disposed to be generous.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.220]   God is not needy.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.260]   Therefore, he never exploits others to make up for some deficiency in himself.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.820]   Instead, the impulse of his nature is to give, not get.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.740]   He is not served by human hands as though he needed anything, since he himself gives
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:19.100]   to all mankind life and breath and everything (Acts 17.25).
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.460]   But his goodness is not disconnected from his righteousness.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:30.860]   It is not bestowed in a way that would deny his infinite value and beauty and greatness.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:36.780]   This is why God's righteousness involves final punishment as well as goodness.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:44.700]   When God punishes the unrepentant in hell, he is not bestowing his goodness on them,
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.820]   but he does not cease to be good.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.220]   His holiness and righteousness govern the bestowal of his goodness.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:39:01.820]   This is why his goodness flows especially toward those who fear him and take refuge in him.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:09.020]   "Oh, how abundant is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you,
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.980]   and worked for those who take refuge in you" (Psalm 31.19).
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.660]   This reverence and faith do not earn God's goodness.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:25.500]   Finite, totally dependent sinners can't earn anything from God.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   God's goodness to sinners is always free and undeserved.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:36.780]   Why, then, is God prone to show his abundant goodness to those who fear him and take refuge
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.180]   in him?
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:46.460]   It's because such reverence and faith display God's worth and beauty and greatness (Romans 4.20)
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:54.300]   and therefore God's righteousness inclines him to affirm such God-honoring attitudes.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.860]   What, then, of the coronavirus?
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:08.460]   We turn in the next chapter to God's all-knowing, all-governing sovereignty over all things.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:16.220]   But what we have seen here will keep us from jumping to the conclusion that God's fingers
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.100]   in the coronavirus discredit his holiness or righteousness or goodness.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:28.460]   We will not be so naive as to equate human suffering with divine unrighteousness,
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.860]   or to conclude that God has ceased to be holy or good when he governs his world.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.620]   All of us are sinners, no exceptions.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:47.420]   We all have exchanged the glory of God's worth and beauty and greatness for things we enjoy
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.420]   more (Romans 1.23, 3.23).
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:57.020]   This is a shameful dishonor to God, whether we feel it or not.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.460]   We, therefore, are deserving of punishment.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:06.540]   Our dishonoring of God's glory makes us worthy objects of holy wrath.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:13.500]   The Bible says we are "by nature children of wrath" (Ephesians 2.3),
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:20.620]   which means that God would be holy and righteous to withhold his goodness from us.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:29.420]   The coronavirus, therefore, does not point to God's unholiness or unrighteousness or lack of
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:29.900]   goodness.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:35.820]   Our rock in these troubled days is not unrighteous.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.140]   He is not unholy.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.340]   There is none holy like the Lord.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:47.180]   There is no rock like our God (1 Samuel 2.2).
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.100]   Our rock is not a mirage.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:51.840]   4.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.980]   Sovereign over all
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:02.060]   In chapter 2, I use the phrase "bitter providence."
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.020]   That's what the coronavirus is.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:11.740]   To describe some of God's works as "bitter" is not blasphemy.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:18.700]   Naomi, Ruth's mother-in-law who lost her husband, her two sons, and one daughter-in-law
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:24.700]   through famine and exile, said, "The Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:29.500]   I went away full, and the Lord has brought me back empty.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.420]   The Almighty has brought calamity upon me."
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.780]   (Ruth 1.20-21)
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:41.100]   She was not lying, overstating, or accusing.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.260]   It was a simple and terrible fact.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.700]   Bitter providence is not a disparagement of God's ways.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.380]   It's a description.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:58.700]   I also said in chapter 2 that the sweetness of God's Word is not diminished in the midst
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   of this bitter providence.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:07.340]   Not if we have learned the secret of sorrowful yet always rejoicing (2 Corinthians 6.10).
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.700]   I said we would come back to this secret.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.460]   Then I summed it up in a sentence.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:21.980]   The same sovereignty that could stop the coronavirus yet doesn't is the very sovereignty
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.300]   that sustains the soul in it.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:28.700]   Knowing this makes all the difference.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.020]   So, is it true?
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.780]   What God wills, He does.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:42.700]   My aim in this chapter and the next is to show that God is all-governing and all-wise.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.820]   He is sovereign over the coronavirus.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.260]   I want to show that this is good news.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:57.820]   Indeed, it is the secret of experiencing the sweetness of God in His bitter providences.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:03.100]   Saying that God is all-governing means He is sovereign.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:11.500]   His sovereignty means that He can do, and in fact does do, all that He decisively wills
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:11.900]   to do.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:20.380]   I say decisively because God, in a sense, wills things He does not carry through.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:25.500]   He can express desires that He Himself chooses not to act on.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.420]   In that sense, they are not decisive.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:37.100]   He Himself does not let such willing or desiring rise to the level of performance.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.780]   For example, consider Lamentations 3, 32 to 33.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:49.900]   "Though He cause grief, He will have compassion according to the abundance of His steadfast love,
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:56.540]   for He does not afflict from His heart or grieve the children of men."
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.340]   He does grieve us, but not from His heart.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:08.540]   I take that to mean that while there are aspects of His character, His heart, that incline
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:16.380]   away from grieving us, nevertheless other aspects of His character dictate the holiness
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.380]   and righteousness of grieving us.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.940]   He is not double-minded.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:28.060]   There is a perfect beauty and coherence in how all of His attributes cooperate.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.340]   But neither is He without complexity.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:37.340]   His character is more like a symphony than a solo performance.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:46.060]   So when I say that God's sovereignty means that He can do and, in fact, does do all that
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:55.020]   He decisively wills to do, I mean there is no force outside Himself that can thwart or
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.940]   frustrate His will.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.740]   When He decides for a thing to happen, it happens.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:09.100]   Or, to put it another way, everything happens because God wills it to happen.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.780]   All-pervasive sovereignty.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:21.180]   Isaiah teaches that this is part of the very essence of what it means to be God.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.620]   "I am God, and there is no other.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:31.660]   I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:40.460]   times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.420]   purpose.'"
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.980]   Isaiah 46, 9-10.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:51.020]   To be God is to cause His own counsel to stand, always.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.660]   God does not just declare what future events will happen.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.940]   He makes them happen.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:06.700]   He speaks His Word, and then He adds, "I am watching over My Word to perform it,"
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.940]   Jeremiah 1, 12.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:16.140]   Which means, "As Job learned from hard experience, 'I know that you can do all things, and
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.780]   that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.'"
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.100]   Job 42, 2.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:27.340]   Or, "As Nebuchadnezzar learned from his merciful humiliation, 'All the inhabitants of the
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:32.780]   earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:39.740]   and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay his hand or say to him, 'What
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.380]   have you done?'"
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.420]   Daniel 4, 35.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:51.980]   Or, "As the psalmist says, 'Whatever the Lord pleases, He does in heaven and on earth,
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.580]   in the seas and all deeps.'"
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.060]   Psalm 135, 6.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:03.580]   Or, as the apostle Paul sums up, "He works all things according to the counsel of His
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.220]   will."
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.660]   Ephesians 1, 11.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:15.660]   All things, not some things, and according to the counsel of His will, not according
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.780]   to wills or forces outside Himself.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:25.820]   In other words, the sovereignty of God is all-encompassing and all-pervasive.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:30.540]   He holds absolute sway over this world.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:43.340]   He governs wind, lightning, snow, frogs, gnats, flies, locusts, quail, worms, fish, sparrows,
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:54.700]   grass, plants, famine, the sun, prison doors, blindness, deafness, paralysis, fever, every
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:02.780]   disease, travel plans, the hearts of kings, nations, murderers, and spiritual deadness,
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.740]   and all of them do His sovereign will.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.620]   Not a season for sentimental views of God.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:17.980]   The coronavirus was sent, therefore, by God.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.460]   This is not a season for sentimental views of God.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.060]   It is a bitter season.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.700]   And God ordained it.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.220]   God governs it.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.260]   He will end it.
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.780]   No part of it is outside His sway.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.100]   Life and death are in His hand.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:42.300]   Job did not sin with his lips when he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.660]   naked shall I return.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:48.220]   The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.940]   Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.380]   Job 1:21.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.460]   The Lord gave, and the Lord took.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.060]   The Lord took Job's ten children.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:06.300]   In the presence of God, no one has a right to life.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:10.060]   Every breath we take is a gift of grace.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.420]   Every heartbeat undeserved.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.500]   Life and death are finally in the hands of God.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:24.220]   "See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no God besides me.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.620]   I kill and I make alive.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:31.500]   I wound and I heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand."
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.140]   Deuteronomy 32, 39.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:41.500]   Therefore, as we ponder our future with the coronavirus or any other life-threatening
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:46.460]   situation, James tells us how to think and speak.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:54.540]   "You ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live,' and do this or that."
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.820]   James 4:15.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.860]   If He wills, we will live.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.340]   If not, we won't.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:06.460]   For all I know, I will not live to see this book published.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:11.500]   I have at least one relative infected with the coronavirus.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:16.940]   I am 74 years old, and my lungs are compromised with a blood clot and seasonal bronchitis.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.380]   But these factors do not ultimately decide.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.140]   God decides.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.900]   Is that good news?
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.200]   Yes.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.780]   I'll try to show why in the next chapter.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.740]   Chapter 5.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.140]   The Sweetness of His Reign.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:42.940]   Why should I receive the news of God's sovereignty over the coronavirus and over my life
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.260]   as a sweet teaching?
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:53.660]   The secret, I said, is knowing that the same sovereignty that could stop the coronavirus
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:58.860]   yet doesn't is the very sovereignty that sustains the soul in it.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:05.660]   In other words, if we try to rescue God from His sovereignty over suffering,
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.420]   we sacrifice His sovereignty to turn all things for good.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.140]   God's dethronement is not good news.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:20.700]   The very sovereignty that rules in sickness is the sovereignty that sustains in loss.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:27.100]   The very sovereignty that takes life is the sovereignty that conquered death and brings
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.420]   believers home to heaven and Christ.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:39.420]   It is not sweet to think that Satan, sickness, sabotage, fate, or chance has the last say in my life.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.820]   That is not good news.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.140]   Not good news.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   That God reigns is good news.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.200]   Why?
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:55.820]   Because God is holy and righteous and good, and He is infinitely wise.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.540]   With God are wisdom and might.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.620]   He has counsel and understanding, Job 12:13.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.420]   His understanding is beyond measure, Psalm 147:5.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:13.900]   Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God, Romans 11:33.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:22.220]   His great aim is that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.980]   and authorities in the heavenly places, Ephesians 3:10.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:31.180]   Nothing surprises Him, confuses Him, or baffles Him.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:41.420]   His infinite power rests in the hands of infinite holiness and righteousness and goodness and wisdom.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:49.100]   And all of that stands in the service of those who trust His Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:57.900]   What God did in sending Jesus to die for sinners has everything to do with the coronavirus.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.900]   How God secured all things for sinners.
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.260]   Here's the connection.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.460]   It's Romans 8, 32.
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:15.020]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all,
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:21.820]   how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?"
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:29.100]   This means that God's willingness to send His Son to be crucified in our place
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:39.260]   is His declaration and validation that He will use all His sovereignty to give us all things.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:46.780]   How will He not also with Him graciously give us all things?
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.980]   Meaning, He most certainly will.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.220]   It is guaranteed by the blood of His Son.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.580]   And what are these "all things"?
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:01.900]   They are the things we need to do His will, glorify His name,
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.780]   and make it safely into His joyful presence.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:12.540]   Three verses later, Paul explains how it works in real life, in the coronavirus.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:20.780]   What does it look like when God's infinite, blood-certified commitment to give us all things
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.300]   meets the coronavirus?
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.140]   Here's what he says.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.660]   "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:35.500]   Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword,
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.420]   or coronavirus?
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:43.260]   As it is written, 'For your sake we are being killed all day long,
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.820]   we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.'
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:50.940]   No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.980]   Romans 8, 35-37.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.620]   Don't miss these painful and amazing words.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.220]   "We are being killed all day long."
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:11.900]   That means that the "all things" God will give to us, because He did not spare His own Son,
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.500]   includes bringing us safely through death.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.340]   Or as He says in Romans 8, 38-39,
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:31.580]   "I am sure that neither death nor life will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:35.500]   What Satan means for evil.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:44.940]   Even if Satan, on his divine leash, has a hand in our suffering and death,
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.860]   he is not ultimate.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:51.260]   He cannot hurt us without God's permission and limitation.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:57.020]   Job 1.12, Luke 22.31, 2 Corinthians 12.7
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:05.900]   And in the end, it is right for us to say to Satan what Joseph said to his brothers who had sold him into slavery,
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:12.700]   "As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good."
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.700]   Genesis 50.20
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:18.780]   Be careful not to water this down.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:26.620]   It does not say, "God used it for good," or "God turned it for good."
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.500]   It says, "God meant it for good."
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.620]   They had an evil purpose.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.300]   God had a good purpose.
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:42.140]   God didn't start cleaning up halfway through this sinful affair.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.020]   He had a purpose, a meaning, from the beginning.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.860]   From the start, he meant it for good.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:58.540]   This is the key to comfort when the evil of men and the evil of Satan compound our suffering.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:08.460]   In Christ, we have every right to say to Satan or to evil men, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good."
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:13.420]   Neither Satan nor sickness nor sinful man is sovereign.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:20.700]   Only God is, and he is good and wise and sovereign.
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:25.260]   Not a sparrow, every hair.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:33.820]   Jesus expresses the sweetness of God's sovereignty for his disciples as beautifully as anyone.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:37.340]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.100]   And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.220]   But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.820]   Fear not, therefore.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.580]   You are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.860]   Matthew 10, 29 to 31.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:58.380]   Not one sparrow falls but by God's plan.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:04.060]   Not one virus moves but by God's plan.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:08.220]   This is meticulous sovereignty.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.060]   And what does Jesus say next?
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.340]   Three things.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:15.020]   You are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.820]   The hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.340]   Fear not.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.180]   Why not?
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:30.540]   Because God's meticulous sovereignty, whether we live or die, serves his holiness and righteousness
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:34.060]   and goodness and wisdom in Christ.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:39.580]   In Christ, we are not his dispensable pawns.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.980]   We are his valued children.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.700]   You are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.500]   This is the secret mentioned earlier.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:56.220]   Knowing that the same sovereignty that could stop the coronavirus yet doesn't
[00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.620]   is the very sovereignty that sustains the soul in it.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:07.500]   And not only sustains, but sees to it that everything bitter and sweet
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:14.780]   works together for our good, the good of those who love God and are called in Christ.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.780]   Romans 8, 28 to 30.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:21.100]   Immortal till my work is done.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:29.660]   That kind of rock-solid confidence in the face of death has emboldened Christ's people for
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.700]   2,000 years.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:36.860]   The truth of God's wise and good sovereignty has been the stabilizing power for thousands
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.740]   of Christians in the sacrifices of love.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:46.380]   For example, Henry Martin, missionary to India and Persia, who died of the plague like the
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:56.140]   coronavirus when he was 31, October 16, 1812, wrote in his journal in January 1812, "To
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.540]   all appearance, the present year will be more perilous than any I have seen.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.180]   But if I live to complete the Persian New Testament, my life after that will be of less
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:07.740]   importance.
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:14.620]   But whether life or death be mine, may Christ be magnified in me.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:20.060]   If he has work for me to do, I cannot die."
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:27.820]   This has often been paraphrased as, "I am immortal till Christ's work for me to do is
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.320]   done."
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.620]   This is profoundly true.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:37.820]   And it rests squarely on the reality that life and death are in the hands of our sovereign
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.620]   God.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:42.780]   Indeed, the entire cause of Christ is in his hand.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   Seven years earlier, Martin, at the age of 24, had written, "Were God not the sovereign
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.580]   of the universe, how miserable I should be!
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.740]   But the Lord reigneth.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.940]   Let the earth be glad, and Christ's cause shall prevail.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:02.620]   O my soul, be happy in the prospect."
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.740]   Part 2.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:09.820]   What is God doing through the coronavirus?
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.500]   Preliminary thoughts, seeing and pointing.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:24.140]   If God has not been dethroned, if indeed he governs all things according to the counsel
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:31.420]   of his will, Ephesians 1.11, and if this coronavirus outbreak, with all its devastation, is in
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:38.140]   his holy, righteous, good, and wise hands, then what is he doing?
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.380]   What are his purposes?
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.700]   Stop regarding man.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   The first thing to say before trying to answer this question is that, compared to the wisdom
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.500]   of God, my opinion counts for nothing.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.180]   So does yours.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:02.700]   What we think out of our own heads is of little significance.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:10.300]   The Bible says that whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, Proverbs 28.26.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:17.660]   Instead, we are told, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.780]   own understanding," Proverbs 3.5.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:30.620]   We humans are finite, sinful, culturally conditioned, and shaped and misshaped by our
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.300]   genes and personal history.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:38.780]   Out of our hearts and minds and mouths come every manner of self-justifying rationalization
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.060]   of our own preferences.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:48.300]   So we would be wise to pay attention to the prophet Isaiah when he says, "Stop regarding
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:53.500]   man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?"
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.980]   Isaiah 2.22.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:04.460]   Is it then not presumption for me to write this book, let alone a section titled, "What
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.180]   is God doing through the coronavirus?"
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:16.380]   No, it is not presumption, not if God has spoken in the Christian scriptures, not if
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:24.620]   God has stooped to speak in human words so that we might truly, though partially, know
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.380]   him and his ways.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:34.940]   Not if Paul's words are true, "God lavished his grace upon us in all wisdom and insight,
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:40.060]   making known to us the mystery of his will," Ephesians 1.8-9.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:47.340]   Not if, as Paul says, "By reading you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ,"
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.100]   Ephesians 3.4.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.660]   God is not silent about what he is doing in this world.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.060]   He has given us the scriptures.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:02.700]   In chapter 2, I pointed to some of the reasons why we may trust the Bible as God's Word.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:07.740]   So my aim is not to dream up ideas about what God might be doing.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:13.020]   My aim is to listen to his Word in scripture and commend to you what I hear.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:17.260]   How inscrutable his ways.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:23.660]   Another thing I should say before I try to answer the question, "What is God doing?"
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:29.340]   is that he is always doing a billion things we do not know.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:34.620]   You have multiplied, O Lord my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.340]   None can compare with you.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.900]   I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.500]   Psalm 40.5.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:49.420]   Not only are his designs in the coronavirus beyond counting,
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.260]   they are in many ways inscrutable.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.900]   "O the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:05.020]   How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways!" Romans 11.33.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.740]   But when Paul wrote that, he was not saying, "So close your Bible and make up your own reality."
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:19.660]   On the contrary, those words about God's inscrutable ways were written as a climax
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:27.260]   to eleven chapters of the greatest news in the world, all of which are written to be understood.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.540]   For example, when Paul touches on the inevitability of suffering, he says,
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:39.020]   "We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:45.180]   and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:52.540]   because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit." Romans 5.3-5.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:59.820]   Knowing the scriptures are written that we might know the things God has revealed,
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:04.700]   especially about suffering, including this coronavirus outbreak.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:11.980]   So "inscrutable" means that God is always doing more than we can see,
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:17.980]   and even what we can see, we would not have seen if he had not revealed it.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.260]   Pointing to reality.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:27.980]   So my job here is not to imagine, as in John Lennon's famous song.
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:33.100]   He tells us to imagine that there's no heaven, no hell, but only sky,
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:37.900]   and then he says that such imagining is easy. Just try.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:48.220]   Right! It is easy. Way too easy. The coronavirus demands hard reality, not easy imaginings.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:53.980]   God and his word are the reality we need, the rock under our feet.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:59.820]   So my aim here is to point to reality, not create reality.
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:05.980]   My aim is to hear what God has said and affirm rather than imagine.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:13.900]   I will point to what the Bible teaches and then make the connections with the coronavirus.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.620]   Yours is to judge what is right.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:22.220]   I say that because it's what Jesus said about interpreting the present time.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.340]   He was indignant that people could use their reason to make sense out of weather patterns,
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:30.540]   but not the divine working of God in history.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.940]   You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky,
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.140]   but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.740]   And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.020]   Luke 12, 56-57.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:53.900]   So my hope is that you will ask for God's help, look to God's word,
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.980]   and judge for yourselves what is right.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:04.140]   I hope you will test what I say by the scriptures and hold fast to what is good.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.300]   Six Paths to Follow
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:17.340]   Many pages could be written about each of the six answers I am going to give to the question,
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.660]   "What is God doing through the coronavirus?"
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:24.540]   But with the urgency of the hour, I won't take time for that.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:31.980]   I will only point to paths of biblical truth that I hope you will pursue after you close this book.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   I wish we could walk far down those paths together, but I must leave that with you.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.980]   May God guide you.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:45.100]   What is God doing through the coronavirus?
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.540]   Chapter 6, Picturing Moral Horror
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.340]   Answer 1.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:58.140]   God is giving the world, in the coronavirus outbreak, as in all other calamities,
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:05.740]   a physical picture of the moral horror and spiritual ugliness of God-belittling sin.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:13.500]   Sin, in fact, is why all physical misery is so terrible.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.100]   Sin is the cause of all misery.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.100]   Creation was subjected to futility,
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.100]   Creation was subjected to futility,
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.100]   not willingly,
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.100]   but because of Him who subjected it
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.100]   in hope that the creation
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:51.100]   itself will be set free
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.100]   from its bondage to corruption
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.100]   and obtain the freedom of the glory
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   of the children of God.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.100]   For we know that the whole creation
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.100]   has been groaning together in the pains
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.100]   of childbirth until now.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.100]   Romans 8, 20-22
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.100]   Futility,
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.100]   bondage to corruption,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.100]   groaning, these are
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.100]   the images of global
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.100]   devastation and misery
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.100]   since sin entered the world.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.100]   And Paul says this devastation
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.100]   is owing to God's judgment.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.100]   The creation
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.100]   was subjected to
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.100]   futility because of Him who
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.100]   subjected it in hope.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.100]   Romans 8, 20
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.100]   Satan did not subject
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.100]   it in hope.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.100]   Adam did not subject it
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.100]   in hope. God did.
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.100]   As Paul said in Romans 5, 16
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.100]   The judgment
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   following one trespass
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.100]   brought condemnation.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:51.100]   Even His children
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.100]   under judgment.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   To be sure,
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.100]   this passage is full
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.100]   of hope.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.100]   The freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.100]   Romans 8, 21
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.100]   God has a stunning
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.100]   plan for a new creation
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.100]   where He will wipe away every
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.100]   tear from their eyes. Revelation
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.100]   21, 4
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.100]   But for now,
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.100]   we are all under His
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   judgment. He has
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.100]   subjected the world to death,
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.100]   disaster, and misery.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.100]   Yes,
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.100]   even His own children.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.100]   Those whom He
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.100]   predestined for adoption.
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.100]   Ephesians 1, 5
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   Redeemed by the blood of His Son.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.100]   Ephesians 1, 7
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.100]   And appointed for eternal life. Ephesians 1,
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.100]   18
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.100]   Even we suffer
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.100]   and die because of
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.100]   God's judgment in the
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.100]   fall.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.100]   We ourselves, who have
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.100]   the firstfruits of the Spirit grown
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.100]   inwardly as we wait eagerly
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.100]   for adoption as sons,
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100]   the redemption of our bodies.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.100]   Romans 8, 23
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.100]   Christians get
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.100]   swept away in tsunamis.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.100]   Christians are killed
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.100]   in terrorist attacks.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   Christians get the coronavirus.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:15.100]   Purification,
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.100]   not punishment.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.100]   The difference
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.100]   for Christians, those
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.100]   who embrace Christ as their
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.100]   supreme treasure, is that
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.100]   our experience of this corruption
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.100]   is not condemnation.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.100]   There is, therefore, now no
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.100]   condemnation for those
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.100]   who are in Christ.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.100]   Romans 8, 1
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.100]   The pain for us
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.100]   is purifying, not
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.100]   punitive.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.100]   God has not destined us for wrath.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.100]   1 Thessalonians
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   5, 9
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.100]   We die of disease
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.100]   and disaster like all humans.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.100]   But for those who
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.100]   are in Christ, the sting
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   of death has been removed.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.100]   1 Corinthians 15, 55
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.100]   To die is gain.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.100]   Philippians 1, 21
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.100]   To depart is to be with
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.100]   Christ. Philippians 1,
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.100]   23
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:13.100]   Satan is
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.100]   real and restricted.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.100]   When I trace the miseries of this
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.100]   world back to God's judgment, I am
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.100]   not shutting my eyes to the fact
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   that Satan is very involved
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.100]   in our global misery.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.100]   The Bible calls him
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.100]   the God of this world.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.100]   2 Corinthians 4, 4
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.100]   And the ruler of this world.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   John 12, 31
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.100]   And the prince of the power of the air.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.100]   Ephesians 2, 2
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.100]   He has been a murderer from the beginning.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.100]   John 8, 44
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.100]   He binds and oppresses
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.100]   with many
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.100]   diseases. Luke 13,
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.100]   16 Acts 10, 38
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.100]   But Satan is on
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.100]   a leash. The
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.100]   leash is in God's hands.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.100]   He does not act
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.100]   without God's leave.
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.100]   He acts only with permission
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.100]   and limitation.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.100]   God decides finally the
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.100]   extent of Satan's damage. He is
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.100]   not separate from God's judgment.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.100]   He serves it unwittingly.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:19.100]   Key question.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.100]   Now here's the
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.100]   question that brings the meaning
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.100]   of the coronavirus into sharper
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.100]   focus. Why did
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.100]   God bring a physical
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.100]   judgment on the
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.100]   world for a moral evil?
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.100]   Adam and Eve
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.100]   defied God. Their hearts
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.100]   turned against God.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.100]   They preferred their own wisdom
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.100]   to His. They chose independence
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.100]   over trust.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.100]   This defying and
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:49.100]   preferring and choosing
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.100]   was a spiritual and
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.100]   moral evil. It was
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.100]   sin in the soul
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.100]   first, not in the body.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.100]   It was first Godward,
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.100]   not manward.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.100]   But in response to
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.100]   moral and spiritual rebellion,
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.100]   God subjected
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.100]   the physical world
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.100]   to disaster and misery.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.100]   Why?
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.100]   Why not leave the physical world
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.100]   in good order and bring misery
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.100]   on the human soul, since that's
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.100]   where it all started?
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.100]   An answer.
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.100]   Here's
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.100]   my suggestion.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.100]   God put the physical world
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.100]   under a curse so
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.100]   that the physical horrors
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.100]   we see around us in diseases
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.100]   and calamities would
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.100]   become a vivid
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.100]   picture of how horrible
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.100]   sin is.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.100]   In other words, physical evil
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.100]   is a parable,
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.100]   a drama, a signpost
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.100]   pointing to the moral
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.100]   outrage of rebellion
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.100]   against God.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.100]   Why might that be fitting?
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.100]   Because in
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.100]   our present condition, after
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.100]   the fall, blinded by
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.100]   sin, we cannot
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.100]   see or feel
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.100]   how repugnant sin
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.100]   against God is. Hardly anyone
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.100]   in the world feels
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.100]   the horror of preferring
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.100]   other things over God.
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.100]   Who loses any sleep
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.100]   over our daily
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.100]   belittling of God by neglect
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.100]   and defiance?
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.100]   But oh, how we
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.100]   feel our physical pain!
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100]   How indignant we
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.100]   can become if God touches our
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.100]   bodies! We may not
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.100]   grieve over the way we demean
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.100]   God every day in our hearts,
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.100]   but let the coronavirus
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:43.100]   come and threaten our bodies,
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.100]   and he has our attention.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.100]   Or does he?
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.100]   Physical pain is God's
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.100]   trumpet blast to tell us
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.100]   that something is dreadfully
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.100]   wrong in the world.
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.100]   Disease and deformity are
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.100]   God's pictures in the physical
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.100]   realm of what sin is
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.100]   like in the spiritual realm.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.100]   And that is true,
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.100]   even though some
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.100]   of the most godly people
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.100]   in the world
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.100]   bear those diseases and
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.100]   deformities.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.100]   Calamities are God's previews
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.100]   of what sin deserves
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.100]   and will one day receive in
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.100]   judgment a thousand times worse.
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.100]   They are warnings.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.100]   They are wake-up calls
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.100]   to see the moral
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.100]   horror and spiritual ugliness
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.100]   of sin against God.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.100]   Would that we could all
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.100]   see and feel
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.100]   how repugnant, how offensive,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.100]   how abominable it is
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.100]   to treat our Maker
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   with contempt,
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.100]   to ignore Him and
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.100]   distrust Him and demean Him
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.100]   and give Him less attention
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.100]   in our hearts than we
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.100]   give the style of our hair.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.100]   We need to see
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.100]   this and feel this,
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:01.100]   or we will not turn to
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.100]   Christ for salvation from the ugliness
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.100]   of sin.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.100]   We may cry out to escape from the penalty
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.100]   of sin, but will we see
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.100]   and hate the God-demeaning
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.100]   moral ugliness of sin?
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.100]   If we don't,
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.100]   it will not be because
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.100]   God has not provided vivid portrayals
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:21.100]   of it in physical misery,
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:23.100]   like the coronavirus.
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.100]   Therefore, God is
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.100]   mercifully shouting to us in these days,
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.100]   "Wake up!
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.100]   Sin against God is like this.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.100]   It is horrible
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.100]   and ugly
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.100]   and far more dangerous than the
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.100]   coronavirus."
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.100]   Chapter 7
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.100]   Sending Specific Divine Judgments
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.100]   Sending Specific Divine Judgments
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.100]   Answer 2
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.100]   Some people will be
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.100]   infected with the coronavirus as
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.100]   a specific judgment from God
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.100]   because of their sinful attitudes and actions.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.100]   The fact that
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.100]   all misery is a
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.100]   result of the Fall,
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.100]   a result of the
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.100]   entrance of God-diminishing
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.100]   sin into the world,
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.100]   does not mean that
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.100]   all individual suffering
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.100]   is a specific judgment for
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.100]   personal sins.
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.100]   For example, Job's
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.100]   suffering was not owing to his
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.100]   particular sins.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.100]   The very first sentence of that book
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.100]   makes this clear. Job
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.100]   was blameless and upright,
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.100]   one who feared God and
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.100]   turned away from evil. Job
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.100]   won.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.100]   And as we saw earlier,
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.100]   God's own people experience
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.100]   many of the physical effects of His
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.100]   judgment. The Apostle Peter
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.100]   put it like this, "It is
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.100]   time for judgment to begin
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.100]   at the household of God.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.100]   And if it begins with us,
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.100]   what will be the outcome
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.100]   of those who do not obey the
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.100]   gospel of God?
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.100]   And if the righteous is scarcely
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.100]   saved, what will become
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.100]   of the ungodly and sinner?"
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:03.100]   1 Peter 4, 17-18.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.100]   For the household of God,
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.100]   this judgment from God is
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.100]   purifying, not punitive,
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.100]   not punishment.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.100]   So not all suffering
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.100]   is owing to the specific judgments
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.100]   of God on specific sins.
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.100]   Nevertheless, God
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.100]   sometimes uses
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:25.100]   His ease to bring
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.100]   particular judgments upon those
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.100]   who reject Him and give
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.100]   themselves over to sin.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.100]   Examples
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.100]   of specific judgments on specific sins.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:39.100]   I'll give two examples
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.100]   of specific judgments on
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.100]   specific sins. In
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.100]   Acts 12, Herod
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.100]   the king exalted himself
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.100]   by allowing himself to be called
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   a god. Immediately,
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.100]   the angel of the Lord struck him down
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   because he did not
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.100]   give God the glory, and he
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100]   was eaten by worms
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.100]   and breathed his last.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.100]   Acts 12, 23.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.100]   God can do that
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.100]   with all who exalt themselves,
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.100]   which means we should
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.100]   be amazed
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.100]   that more of our rulers
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.100]   do not drop dead
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.100]   every day because of their
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.100]   arrogance before God and man.
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.100]   God's restraint
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100]   is a great mercy.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.100]   Another example
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.100]   is the sin of homosexual
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.100]   intercourse. In Romans
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.100]   1, 27, the apostle Paul
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.100]   says, "Men likewise
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.100]   gave up natural affections
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.100]   with women and were consumed
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.100]   with passion for one another,
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.100]   men committing shameless acts
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.100]   with men and receiving
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.100]   in themselves the due
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.100]   penalty for their error."
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.100]   That due penalty
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.100]   is the painful effect
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.100]   in themselves
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.100]   of their sin.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.100]   This due penalty
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.100]   is just one example
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.100]   of the judgment of God that we see
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.100]   in Romans 1, 18, where it says,
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.100]   "The wrath of God is
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.100]   revealed from heaven against all
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.100]   ungodliness and unrighteousness
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.100]   of men who by their unrighteousness
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.100]   suppress the truth."
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.100]   Therefore, while
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.100]   not all suffering is a specific
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.100]   judgment for specific sins,
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.100]   some is.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.100]   Let
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.100]   every soul be searched.
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.100]   The coronavirus
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.100]   is, therefore,
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.100]   never a clear
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.100]   and simple punishment
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.100]   on any person.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.100]   The most loving, spirit-
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.100]   filled Christian, whose
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.100]   sins are forgiven through Christ
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.100]   may die of the
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.100]   coronavirus disease.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.100]   But it is fitting
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.100]   that every one of us
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.100]   search our own heart
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.100]   to discern if our suffering
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.100]   is God's judgment on the way we live.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.100]   If we come to Christ,
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.100]   we can know
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.100]   that our suffering
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.100]   is not the punitive
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.100]   judgment of God.
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.100]   We can know this
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.100]   because Jesus said,
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.100]   "Whoever hears my word and
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.100]   believes him who sent me
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:15.100]   has eternal life. He does
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.100]   not come into judgment
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.100]   but has passed from
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.100]   death to life." John 5
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.100]   24. There is no
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.100]   condemnation for those who are in Christ
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.100]   Jesus. Romans 8 1.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.100]   It is discipline
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.100]   not destruction.
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.100]   For the Lord disciplines
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.100]   the one he loves
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:37.100]   and chastises every
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.100]   son whom he receives.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.100]   Hebrews 12 6.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.100]   Chapter 8
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.100]   Awakening Us for the Second
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.100]   Coming.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.100]   Answer 3.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.100]   The coronavirus
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.100]   is a God-given wake-up call
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.100]   to be ready for
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.100]   the second coming of Christ.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.100]   Even though
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.100]   the history of the Christian church
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.100]   is littered with
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.100]   failed predictions of the end of the world,
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.100]   it remains true
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.100]   that Jesus Christ
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.100]   is coming back.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.100]   "Men of Galilee," the angel said
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.100]   at Jesus' departure,
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.100]   "why do you stand looking into heaven?
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.100]   This Jesus who was taken up
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.100]   from you into heaven will come
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.100]   in the same way as you saw him
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.100]   go into heaven." Acts 1
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.100]   11. At his
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.100]   coming, he will judge
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.100]   the world. When the Son
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.100]   of Man comes in his glory
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.100]   and all the angels with him,
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.100]   then he will sit on his glorious
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.100]   throne. Before him will be
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.100]   gathered all the nations, and he
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.100]   will separate people one from another
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.100]   as a shepherd separates
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.100]   the sheep from the goats.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.100]   Matthew 25 31-32.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:55.100]   For those who are not ready to meet
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.100]   Christ, that day
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:59.100]   will come suddenly like a
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.100]   trap. Watch yourselves,
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.100]   lest your hearts be weighed
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.100]   down with dissipation and
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.100]   drunkenness and cares of this
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.100]   life, and that day come
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:11.100]   upon you suddenly like a trap.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:13.100]   Luke 21
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.100]   34.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.100]   Birth Pains.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.100]   Jesus
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.100]   said there would be
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.100]   pointers to his coming,
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.100]   like wars, famines,
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.100]   and earthquakes.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.100]   Matthew 24 7.
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.100]   He called these signs
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.100]   "birth pains." Matthew
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.100]   24 8.
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.100]   The image is of the earth
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.100]   as a woman in labor
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.100]   trying to give birth to the new
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.100]   world which Jesus would bring
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.100]   into being at his coming.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.100]   Paul picked up this imagery
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.100]   in Romans 8 22
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:51.100]   and referred the birth
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.100]   pains to all
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.100]   the groanings of this age,
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.100]   all the miseries of disaster
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.100]   and disease, like
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.100]   the coronavirus.
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.100]   He pictured us
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   in our diseases as part
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.100]   of the labor pains of the
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.100]   world. We groan
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.100]   as we wait for the redemption
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.100]   of our bodies at the coming of Jesus,
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.100]   when he will raise the dead
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.100]   and give us new
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.100]   glorious bodies.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.100]   Philippians 3 21.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.100]   The creation itself
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:25.100]   will be set free from its bondage
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.100]   to corruption and obtain
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.100]   the freedom of the glory of
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.100]   the children of God. For
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.100]   we know that the whole creation
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.100]   has been groaning together in the pains
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.100]   of childbirth
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.100]   until now. And not
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.100]   only the creation, but we
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.100]   ourselves, who have the first
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.100]   fruits of the Spirit, groan
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.100]   inwardly as we wait
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.100]   eagerly for adoption as sons,
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.100]   the redemption of our bodies.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.100]   Romans 8 21 to 23.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.100]   Stay awake.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.100]   My point is this.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.100]   Jesus wants
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:03.100]   us to see the birth
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:05.100]   pains, including the
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:07.100]   coronavirus, as
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.100]   reminders and alerts
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.100]   that he is coming
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:13.100]   and that we need to be
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:15.100]   ready. You must be
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.100]   ready, for the Son of Man
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.100]   is coming at an hour you do not expect.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.100]   Matthew 24 44.
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:23.100]   You don't have to be a
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.100]   fate setter in order
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:27.100]   to take seriously what Jesus says.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.100]   And what he says is unmistakable.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:31.100]   Be on guard.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.100]   Keep awake,
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.100]   for you do not know when the time
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.100]   will come. Stay awake,
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:39.100]   for you do not know when
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:41.100]   the Master of the House will come.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.100]   And what I say to you, I say to all,
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:45.100]   stay awake.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.100]   Mark 13 33
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.100]   to 37.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   The message is clear.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.100]   Stay awake. Stay awake.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.100]   Stay awake.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.100]   And the birth pains of the natural
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.100]   world are meant for this
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.100]   message. But oh,
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.100]   how many people are
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:05.100]   not awake.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.100]   For all their frenzied
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.100]   activity, they are sound
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.100]   sleep in regard to the
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.100]   coming of Jesus Christ. The peril
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.100]   is great.
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:17.100]   And the coronavirus
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.100]   is a merciful wake-up
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.100]   call to be ready.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:23.100]   The way to be ready
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.100]   is to come to
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:27.100]   Jesus Christ.
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.100]   Receive forgiveness of sins
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   and walk in his light.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.100]   Then you will be among those
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:35.100]   who are not in
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.100]   darkness for that day to surprise
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:39.100]   you like a thief. For you are
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.100]   all children of light.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.100]   So then let us keep awake,
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.100]   for God has not destined us for wrath,
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.100]   but to obtain salvation
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.100]   through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.100]   who died for us, so that whether
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.100]   we wake or sleep, we might
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:55.100]   live with him.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.100]   1 Thessalonians 5
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.100]   4-10
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.100]   Chapter 9
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.100]   Realigning Us with the
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.100]   Infinite Worth of Christ
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:11.100]   Answer 4
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.100]   The coronavirus is God's
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:15.100]   thunderclap call
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:17.100]   for all of us to repent
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.100]   and realign our lives
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:21.100]   with the infinite worth
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.100]   of Christ.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.100]   The coronavirus
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:27.100]   is not unique
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:29.100]   as a call to repentance.
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.100]   In fact, all natural
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.100]   disasters, whether floods,
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.100]   famines, locusts,
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:37.100]   tsunamis,
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.100]   or diseases,
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.100]   are God's painful and
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.100]   merciful summons
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.100]   to repent. We see this
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.100]   from the way Jesus responds
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.100]   to disaster
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.100]   in Luke 13 1-5.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.100]   There were some present
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.100]   at that very time who told him
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.100]   about the Galileans
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.100]   whose blood Pilate had mingled
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:01.100]   with their sacrifices.
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.100]   And he answered them,
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.100]   "Do you think that these
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.100]   Galileans were worse
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.100]   sinners than all
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.100]   the other Galileans
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.100]   because they suffered in this way?
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.100]   No, I tell you,
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.100]   but unless you repent,
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.100]   you will all likewise perish.
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.100]   Or those eighteen
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.100]   on whom the tower in Siloam
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:25.100]   fell and killed them,
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:27.100]   do you think that they were worse
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:29.100]   offenders than all the others
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:31.100]   who lived in Jerusalem?
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:33.100]   No, I tell you,
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.100]   but unless you repent,
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:37.100]   you will all likewise
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.100]   perish."
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.100]   Pilate had slaughtered
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.100]   worshippers in the temple.
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:45.100]   The tower in Siloam
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:47.100]   had collapsed and killed eighteen
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:49.100]   bystanders. One
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.100]   disaster was the fruit of human wickedness,
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.100]   the other was apparently
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.100]   an accident.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.100]   The meaning of calamity
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.100]   for you.
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.100]   The crowds
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.100]   want to know from Jesus,
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.100]   "What's the meaning of this?
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:07.100]   Was it an act of God's specific
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:09.100]   judgment on specific sins?"
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.100]   Jesus' answer
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.100]   is amazing.
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:15.100]   He draws a meaning from these
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.100]   disasters that relates
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.100]   to everyone,
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.100]   not just the ones who died.
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.100]   In both cases, he says,
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.100]   "No,
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.100]   those who were murdered by Pilate
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.100]   and those who were crushed
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.100]   under the tower were not
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.100]   worse sinners than
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:35.100]   you."
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.100]   Why
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:39.100]   does he bring up their sin?
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.100]   They weren't asking
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.100]   for his opinion about their
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.100]   own sin. They were curious
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.100]   about the others.
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.100]   They wanted to know what the
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.100]   disasters meant for the victims,
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.100]   not for the rest of us.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.100]   That's what makes Jesus'
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.100]   answer amazing.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.100]   In essence, he said
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.100]   that the meaning of these
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.100]   disasters is for everyone,
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.100]   and the
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.100]   message is, "Repent
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:09.100]   or perish."
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:11.100]   He says it twice.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.100]   "Unless you repent,
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:15.100]   you will all likewise perish."
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.100]   Luke 13.3
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   "Unless you repent, you will
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.100]   all likewise perish."
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.100]   Luke 13.5
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.100]   Merciful
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:27.100]   call while there's time.
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:31.100]   What was Jesus doing?
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.100]   He was redirecting
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.100]   the people's astonishment.
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:37.100]   The astonishment that prompted
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.100]   these folks to query Jesus is
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:41.100]   misplaced. They were
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.100]   astonished that people were murdered
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.100]   so cruelly and crushed
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.100]   so meaninglessly.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.100]   But Jesus says
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.100]   what you ought to be astonished
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.100]   at is that you were
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.100]   not the ones murdered and
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.100]   crushed. In fact,
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.100]   if you don't repent, you
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.100]   yourselves will meet a
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:03.100]   judgment like that someday.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.100]   From this,
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.100]   I infer that God
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:09.100]   has a merciful message
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.100]   in all
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.100]   such disasters.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.100]   The message is
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.100]   that we are all sinners
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.100]   bound for destruction,
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.100]   and disasters
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:23.100]   are a gracious
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.100]   summons from God
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.100]   to repent and
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.100]   be saved while there
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.100]   is still time.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.100]   Jesus turned from the dead
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.100]   to the living
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.100]   and essentially said,
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.100]   "Let's not talk
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.100]   about the dead. Let's talk about you.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.100]   This is more
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.100]   urgent. What happened to them
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.100]   is about you.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:49.100]   Your biggest issue is not
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.100]   their sin, but your sin."
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.100]   I think that's God's
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.100]   message for the world in the coronavirus
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.100]   outbreak. He is
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.100]   calling the world to repentance
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   while there is still time.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:05.100]   What does repentance
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:07.100]   mean?
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.100]   Let's be more specific.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.100]   What does repentance mean?
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.100]   The word in the New Testament
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.100]   means a change of heart and mind,
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:17.100]   not a superficial change
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.100]   of opinion, but a deep
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.100]   transformation so that we perceive
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.100]   and prize God
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   and Christ for who they really are.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:27.100]   Jesus described
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.100]   the change like this,
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.100]   "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.100]   and with all your soul and with all
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.100]   your mind." Matthew 22
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.100]   37. "Whoever loves
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.100]   father or mother more than me
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.100]   is not worthy of me, and
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.100]   whoever loves son or daughter more than me
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.100]   is not worthy of me." Matthew
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.100]   10 37.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.100]   In other words, the most fundamental
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.100]   change of heart
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.100]   and mind that
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.100]   repentance calls for
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   is to treasure
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.100]   God with all that
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.100]   you are and to
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:03.100]   treasure Jesus
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:05.100]   more than all other relations.
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:09.100]   Why would Jesus threaten
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:11.100]   us with perishing?
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:13.100]   The reason Jesus
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.100]   said that we
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:17.100]   all likewise would perish
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.100]   if we don't repent
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.100]   is that
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.100]   we all have exchanged
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.100]   the treasure that God is
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.100]   for lesser things we
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.100]   love more. Romans
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.100]   1 22 to 23.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.100]   And we all have
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:35.100]   treated Jesus as less
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.100]   desirable than money and
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.100]   entertainment and friends
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.100]   and family. The reason
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.100]   all of us deserve to perish
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.100]   is not a list
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:47.100]   of rules we have broken,
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.100]   but an infinite value
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   we have scorned—
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.100]   the infinite value
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.100]   of all that God is for us
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.100]   in Jesus Christ.
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.100]   Waking up
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.100]   to our suicidal preferences.
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:05.100]   Repentance means
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.100]   waking up from
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.100]   the suicidal preference
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.100]   of tin over
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.100]   gold, foundations
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.100]   of sand over
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.100]   solid rock,
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.100]   games in the gutter
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.100]   over a holiday at the sea.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.100]   As C.S. Lewis writes,
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.100]   "We are half-hearted creatures,
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.100]   fooling about with
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:29.100]   drink and sex and ambition.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.100]   When infinite joy is offered
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.100]   us, like an ignorant child
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.100]   who wants to go on making mud pies
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.100]   in the slum because he
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.100]   cannot imagine what is meant
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.100]   by the offer of a holiday at
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.100]   the sea, we are far
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.100]   too easily pleased."
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.100]   The infinite
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.100]   joy Lewis mentions
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.100]   is the experience
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.100]   of seeing and savoring
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.100]   and sharing the worth
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.100]   and beauty and greatness
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.100]   of Christ.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.100]   Roused
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.100]   to rely on Christ.
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:07.100]   What God is doing in the coronavirus
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.100]   is showing us,
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.100]   graphically, painfully,
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.100]   that nothing in this world
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.100]   gives the security
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.100]   and satisfaction that we find
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.100]   in the infinite greatness and worth
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.100]   of Jesus. This
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.100]   global pandemic takes away
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.100]   our freedom of movement, our
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:27.100]   business activity, and our
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.100]   face-to-face relations. It takes
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.100]   away our security and our comfort,
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.100]   and in the end,
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.100]   it may take away our lives.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.100]   The reason God
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.100]   exposes us to such losses
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.100]   is to rouse us
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.100]   to rely on Christ.
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.100]   Or to put it another way,
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.100]   the reason he makes calamity
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.100]   the occasion for offering
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.100]   Christ to the world is
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:53.100]   that the supreme, all-satisfying
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.100]   greatness of Christ shines
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.100]   more brightly when Christ sustains
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.100]   us in suffering.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.100]   Gift
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.100]   of desperation.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:05.100]   Consider, for example,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.100]   why God brought
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.100]   Paul to the point where he
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.100]   despaired of life.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.100]   We do not want you to be unaware, brothers,
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.100]   of the affliction we experienced
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.100]   in Asia, for we were so
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.100]   utterly burdened beyond our strength
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.100]   that we despaired of
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.100]   life itself. Indeed,
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.100]   we felt that we had
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:27.100]   received the sentence of death,
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.100]   but that was to make us rely
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.100]   not on ourselves
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.100]   but on God who
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.100]   raises the dead.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.100]   2 Corinthians 1:8-9
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   Paul does not view
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:41.100]   this experience of desperation as
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.100]   satanic
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.100]   or random.
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:47.100]   It is purposeful.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:49.100]   And God is the one
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:51.100]   whose purpose is mentioned.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.100]   This life-threatening experience
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.100]   was to make
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.100]   us rely not on ourselves
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.100]   but on God who raises
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.100]   the dead.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.100]   2 Corinthians 1:9
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.100]   This is the message of the coronavirus.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.100]   Stop
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.100]   relying on yourselves
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.100]   and turn to God.
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.100]   You cannot even stop
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.100]   death. God
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.100]   can raise the dead.
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:19.100]   And, of course, relying
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.100]   on God does not mean that Christians
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.100]   become do-nothings.
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.100]   Christians have never been
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.100]   do-nothings.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.100]   It means that the ground,
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.100]   the pattern, and the goal
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.100]   of all our doings
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.100]   is God. As Paul said,
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.100]   "I worked harder than any of them,
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.100]   though it was not I
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   but the grace of God that was with
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:43.100]   me." 1 Corinthians 15:10
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.100]   The coronavirus
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.100]   calls us
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.100]   to make God
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.100]   the all-important, pervasive
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.100]   reality of our lives.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.100]   Our lives depend
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.100]   on Him more than they depend
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.100]   on breath.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.100]   And sometimes
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.100]   God takes our breath
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.100]   in order to throw us onto
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.100]   Himself.
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.100]   The meaning of thorns.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.100]   Or consider God's purpose in Paul's
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.100]   painful thorn in the flesh.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.100]   "To keep me from becoming conceited
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.100]   because of the surpassing
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.100]   greatness of the revelations,
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:23.100]   a thorn was given to
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.100]   me in the flesh, a messenger
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:27.100]   of Satan to harass me,
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.100]   to keep me from becoming conceited.
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.100]   Three times
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.100]   I pleaded with the Lord about this,
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.100]   that it should leave me.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:37.100]   But He said to me,
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.100]   'My grace is sufficient for you.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.100]   My power is made perfect
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.100]   in weakness. Therefore
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.100]   I will boast all the more
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:47.100]   gladly of my weaknesses, so
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:49.100]   that the power of Christ
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.100]   may rest upon me.'"
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.100]   2 Corinthians 12:7-9
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.100]   Paul was blessed
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.100]   with great revelations.
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.100]   God saw the danger of
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   pride. Satan saw the danger of
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.100]   truth and joy.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:07.100]   God governs
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.100]   Satan's strategy
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:11.100]   so that what Satan thinks will
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.100]   ruin Paul's witness
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.100]   actually serves
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.100]   Paul's humility and
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:19.100]   gladness. Paul gets
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.100]   a thorn
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.100]   in the flesh.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:25.100]   A messenger of Satan
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.100]   and a messenger
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.100]   of God.
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:31.100]   We don't know what the thorn is,
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.100]   but we know that thorns are
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.100]   painful. And we know
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.100]   that Paul asked three times
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.100]   that Christ would take it
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:41.100]   away, but Christ
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:43.100]   will not. He has
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.100]   a purpose for this pain,
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.100]   namely, "My power
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.100]   is made perfect in
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:51.100]   weakness." 2 Corinthians
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.100]   12:9. His purpose
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.100]   is that through Paul's
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.100]   unwavering faith
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:59.100]   and joy, Christ
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.100]   would shine as more
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.100]   valuable than health.
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.100]   Paul's response to this
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.100]   purpose? "I will boast
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.100]   all the more gladly
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:11.100]   of my weaknesses."
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.100]   2 Corinthians
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.100]   12:9.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.100]   Gladly? How can this be?
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:19.100]   Why is Paul willing to
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.100]   embrace his thorn with
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.100]   gladness? Because his
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.100]   greatest goal in life is that
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.100]   Christ be magnified in his body,
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.100]   whether by life or by death.
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.100]   Philippians 1:20.
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:33.100]   To see the beauty of Christ,
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.100]   to cherish Christ as the
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.100]   supreme treasure, to show
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.100]   Christ to the world as better
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.100]   than health and life,
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.100]   that was Paul's joy.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.100]   A beautiful
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.100]   poem called "The Thorn"
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.100]   by Martha Snell Nicholson
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.100]   1898-1953
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:53.100]   ends like this.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.100]   "I learned he never
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.100]   gives a thorn without this added
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:59.100]   grace. He takes
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:01.100]   the thorn to pin aside the
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:03.100]   veil which hides his face."
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:07.100]   In loss, gain.
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:11.100]   Paul embraced loss
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.100]   in part because
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:15.100]   in the loss, Christ
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:17.100]   was more fully
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.100]   gained. "Indeed,
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:21.100]   I count everything as loss because
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.100]   of the surpassing worth of
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.100]   knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.100]   For his sake I have suffered
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.100]   the loss of all things and count them as
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:31.100]   rubbish in order that I may
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:33.100]   gain Christ."
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.100]   Philippians 3:8.
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.100]   This
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.100]   is what it means to repent,
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:41.100]   to experience
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:43.100]   a change of heart
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.100]   and mind that
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.100]   treasures God in Christ
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.100]   more than life.
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:51.100]   "Because your steadfast
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:53.100]   love is better than life,
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:55.100]   my lips will
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:57.100]   praise you." Psalm 63.
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.100]   This was Paul's
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.100]   faith. It was true in
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.100]   life and death. In life
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:05.100]   because Christ is the sweetness
[01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:07.100]   of every pleasure and better than
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.100]   them all. And in death
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:11.100]   because in God's presence there is
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:13.100]   a fullness of joy.
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.100]   At his right hand are pleasures
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.100]   forevermore.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:19.100]   Psalm 16.11.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   The coronavirus
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.100]   pandemic is the experience
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.100]   of loss.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.100]   From the smallest loss
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.100]   of convenience to the
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:31.100]   greatest loss of
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:33.100]   life. And if we
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.100]   know the secret of Paul's joy,
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:37.100]   we may experience the
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.100]   loss as gain.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.100]   That is what
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.100]   God is saying to the world.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:45.100]   Repent and
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:47.100]   realign your life with
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.100]   the infinite worth
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:51.100]   of Christ.
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.100]   Chapter 10.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.100]   Creating Good Works
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:57.100]   in Danger.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:59.100]   Answer
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:01.100]   5. The
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   coronavirus is God's call
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:05.100]   to his people to overcome
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:07.100]   self-pity and fear and
[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:09.100]   with courageous joy
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:11.100]   to do the good works of love
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.100]   that glorify God.
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.100]   Jesus taught
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:17.100]   his followers to let
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.100]   your light shine before others
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.100]   so that they may see your good
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:23.100]   works and give glory
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:25.100]   to your Father who is in heaven.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.100]   Matthew 5.16.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.100]   What is often not
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.100]   noticed is that
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.100]   being the salt of the earth and
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.100]   the light of the world in this way
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.100]   was the more salty
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:39.100]   and the more bright
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:41.100]   because the good deeds were to be
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.100]   done even in the midst of suffering.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.100]   Brightness in the darkness of danger.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:51.100]   Jesus has just said,
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.100]   "Blessed are you when
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:55.100]   others revile you and
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.100]   persecute you and utter all kinds of
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.100]   evil against you falsely on my account.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:01.100]   Rejoice
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:03.100]   and be glad, for your
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:05.100]   reward is great in heaven."
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.100]   Matthew 5.11.12.
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.100]   Then, without a break,
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:11.100]   he says, "You are
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:13.100]   the salt of the earth. You are the
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:15.100]   light of the world."
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.100]   Matthew 5.13-16.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:19.100]   It is not mere
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:21.100]   good deeds
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.100]   that give Christianity
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.100]   its tang and luster.
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:27.100]   It is good deeds in spite
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.100]   of danger.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.100]   Many non-Christians do
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:33.100]   good deeds, but
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:35.100]   seldom do people give glory
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.100]   to God because of them.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.100]   Yes, the danger
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:41.100]   in Matthew 5 was persecution,
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.100]   not disease.
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.100]   But the principle holds
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.100]   deeds of love
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.100]   in the context of danger,
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.100]   whether disease
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.100]   or persecution,
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:55.100]   point more clearly
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:57.100]   to the fact that these deeds
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.100]   are sustained by hope
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.100]   in God. For example,
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.100]   Jesus says, "When you
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.100]   give a feast, invite the
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:07.100]   poor, the crippled,
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.100]   the lame, the blind,
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.100]   and you will be blessed,
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.100]   because they cannot repay you.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:15.100]   You will be repaid
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.100]   at the resurrection of the just."
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:19.100]   Luke 14.13-14.
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.100]   Luke 14.13-14.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:23.100]   Hope in God, beyond death,
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.100]   you will be repaid at the
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.100]   resurrection, sustains
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.100]   and empowers good
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.100]   deeds that hold
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.100]   no prospect for reward in this
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.100]   life. The same would hold
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.100]   true for good deeds that put
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.100]   us in danger, especially
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:41.100]   the danger of death.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.100]   How Peter
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:45.100]   Applied Jesus' Teaching
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:49.100]   The Apostle Peter,
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.100]   more than any other New Testament
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.100]   writer, picks up the
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.100]   explicit teaching of Jesus about
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:57.100]   good deeds. "Keep your
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.100]   conduct among the Gentiles honorable,
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.100]   so that when they speak against
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:03.100]   you as evildoers, they may see
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.100]   your good deeds and glorify God on the
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.100]   day of visitation." 1 Peter
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.100]   2.12. And Peter
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.100]   makes the same point about
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.100]   good deeds in the face of danger.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:15.100]   He says, "Let those who suffer
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.100]   according to God's will
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:19.100]   entrust their souls
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.100]   to a faithful Creator
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:23.100]   while doing good."
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.100]   1 Peter 4.19.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:27.100]   In other words, don't
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.100]   let the possibility or
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.100]   the reality of suffering
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.100]   stop you from doing good deeds.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:37.100]   Christ died
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.100]   to create good deeds
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.100]   in danger.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.100]   Peter links this
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:45.100]   new kind of life with
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:47.100]   the death of Jesus
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.100]   for our sins.
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.100]   Christ himself
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:53.100]   bore our sins in
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:55.100]   his body on the tree
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:57.100]   that we might die to
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.100]   sin and live
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:01.100]   to righteousness.
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.100]   1 Peter 2.24.
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:05.100]   Because of Christ,
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.100]   Christians put
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:09.100]   sin to death
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.100]   and pour themselves out
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.100]   into the good deeds
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:15.100]   of righteousness.
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.100]   Paul makes the same connection between
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:19.100]   the death of Jesus and the zeal
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:21.100]   of Christians for good works.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.100]   Christ gave himself for us
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:25.100]   to redeem us from
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.100]   all lawlessness and to
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:29.100]   purify for himself a people
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:31.100]   for his own possession who are
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:33.100]   zealous for good works.
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.100]   Titus 2.14.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.100]   Paul also makes
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.100]   it plain that these good works
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.100]   are aimed at both
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.100]   Christians and non-Christians.
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:45.100]   As we have
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.100]   opportunity, let us do
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.100]   good to everyone
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.100]   and especially to those
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.100]   who are of the household of faith.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.100]   Galatians 6.10.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.100]   See that no one repays
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.100]   anyone evil for evil,
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.100]   but always seek to do good to
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:03.100]   one another and to everyone.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:05.100]   1 Thessalonians
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.100]   5.15.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:09.100]   Christ magnified
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:11.100]   in risky
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.100]   kindness.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.100]   The ultimate aim of
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:17.100]   God for his people is that
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.100]   we glorify his
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.100]   greatness and magnify
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:23.100]   the worth of his Son, Jesus Christ.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.100]   Whether you eat
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:27.100]   or drink or whatever you do,
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.100]   do all to the glory of God.
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:31.100]   1 Corinthians 10.31.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:33.100]   It is my eager expectation
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.100]   and hope that Christ will be
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.100]   magnified in my body
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   whether by life or by death.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.100]   Philippians 1.20.
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.100]   God glorified in everything.
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.100]   Christ magnified
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:47.100]   in life and death.
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:49.100]   This is the
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:51.100]   great God-given goal
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.100]   of human life.
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:55.100]   Therefore, one of
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.100]   God's purposes in the coronavirus
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.100]   is that his people
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:01.100]   put to death
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.100]   self-pity and fear
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:05.100]   and give
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:07.100]   themselves to good deeds
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.100]   in the presence of danger.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:11.100]   Christians lean toward
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.100]   need, not comfort.
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.100]   Toward love, not safety.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.100]   That's what our Savior is like.
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:19.100]   That is
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.100]   what he died for.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:23.100]   Example of the
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.100]   early church.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.100]   Rodney Stark
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.100]   in his book, The Triumph
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:31.100]   of Christianity, points out
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.100]   that in the first
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.100]   centuries of the Christian church,
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.100]   the truly
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.100]   revolutionary principle
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.100]   was that Christian love
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.100]   and charity must
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.100]   extend beyond the
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:47.100]   boundaries of family and even
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.100]   those of faith to all
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.100]   in need. Two great
[01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.100]   plagues struck the Roman
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.100]   Empire in A.D. 165
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.100]   and 251.
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:59.100]   Outside of the Christian church,
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.100]   there was no cultural
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.100]   or religious foundation for
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   mercy and sacrifice.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.100]   There was no belief
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.100]   that the gods cared about
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:11.100]   human affairs, and
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:13.100]   mercy was regarded
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:15.100]   as a character defect and pity
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:17.100]   as a pathological emotion.
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.100]   Because mercy involves
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:21.100]   providing unearned help
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.100]   or relief, it is contrary
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:25.100]   to justice.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:27.100]   Therefore, while a third of the
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.100]   empire was perishing from disease,
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.100]   physicians fled to
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.100]   their country estates.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.100]   Those with symptoms were cast
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:37.100]   out of homes.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.100]   Priests forsook the temples.
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.100]   But Stark observes,
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:43.100]   "Christians
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:45.100]   claimed to have answers
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.100]   and most of all
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.100]   they took appropriate
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:51.100]   actions.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:53.100]   The answers included
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:55.100]   the forgiveness of sins
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:57.100]   through Christ and the hope of eternal
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.100]   life beyond death. This was a
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.100]   precious message in a season
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.100]   of medical helplessness and utter
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:05.100]   hopelessness. As for the
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.100]   actions, large
[01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:09.100]   numbers of Christians cared for the
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.100]   sick and dying. Toward
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.100]   the end of the second plague, Bishop
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.100]   Dionysius of Alexandria wrote
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.100]   a letter extolling the
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.100]   members of his church.
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.100]   Most of our brothers showed
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.100]   unbounded love and loyalty,
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.100]   never sparing themselves
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:27.100]   and thinking only of one another.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:29.100]   Heedless of danger,
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.100]   they took charge of the sick,
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.100]   attending to their every need
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:35.100]   and ministering to them in Christ.
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.100]   And with them
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.100]   departed this life
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.100]   serenely happy,
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:43.100]   putting to
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:45.100]   silence the ignorance of emperors.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:49.100]   Over time,
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:51.100]   this counter-cultural, Christ
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.100]   sustained care for the sick
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.100]   and the poor had the effect
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.100]   of winning many people away
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:59.100]   from the surrounding paganism.
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:01.100]   Two centuries later,
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.100]   when the Roman Emperor Julian
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.100]   (AD 332-363)
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.100]   wanted to breathe new
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.100]   life back into the
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.100]   ancient Roman religion and saw
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:13.100]   Christianity as a growing threat,
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.100]   he wrote, in frustration
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:17.100]   to the Roman high priest of Galatia,
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.100]   "Atheism,
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.100]   that is, Christian faith,
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:23.100]   has been specially advanced
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:25.100]   through the loving service rendered
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:27.100]   to strangers and through
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100]   relief for the burial of the dead.
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.100]   It is a scandal
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.100]   that there is not a single Jew
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:35.100]   who is a beggar and that
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:37.100]   the godless Galileans
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:39.100]   (that is, Christians) care not only
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.100]   for their own poor,
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.100]   but for ours as well,
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.100]   while those who belong to us
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.100]   look in vain for help
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.100]   that we should render them."
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:51.100]   Relieving
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:53.100]   God-sent suffering
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:55.100]   There is no
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:57.100]   contradiction between
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.100]   seeing the coronavirus as God's
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:01.100]   act and calling
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.100]   Christians to take risks to
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.100]   alleviate the suffering that it causes.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:07.100]   Ever since God
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:09.100]   subjected the world to sin and misery
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.100]   at the Fall, He has ordained
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:13.100]   that His people seek
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.100]   to rescue the perishing,
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.100]   even though He is the one
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   who has appointed the judgment of the perishing.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.100]   God Himself
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.100]   came into the world in Jesus Christ
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.100]   to rescue people from His
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:27.100]   own just judgment
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.100]   (Romans 5:9).
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.100]   That is what the cross of Christ
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:33.100]   means.
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.100]   Therefore, the good deeds
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.100]   of God's people will
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:39.100]   include prayers for the healing
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.100]   of the sick and for God
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:43.100]   to stay His hand and turn back
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:45.100]   the pandemic and that He
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.100]   would provide a cure.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:49.100]   We pray about the coronavirus
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:51.100]   and we work to alleviate its suffering
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:53.100]   the way Abraham Lincoln prayed
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:55.100]   for the end of the Civil War and
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:57.100]   worked to end it, even though
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:59.100]   he saw it as a
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:01.100]   judgment from God.
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:03.100]   Fondly do we hope,
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.100]   fervently do we pray,
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:07.100]   that this mighty scourge
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.100]   of war may speedily
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.100]   pass away.
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.100]   Yet, if God wills
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:15.100]   that it continue
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:17.100]   until all the wealth
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.100]   piled by the bondman's
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:21.100]   250 years of unrequited
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:23.100]   toil shall be
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.100]   sunk, and until every
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.100]   drop of blood drawn with
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.100]   the last shall be paid by
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.100]   another drawn with
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:33.100]   the sword, as was
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:35.100]   said 3,000 years ago,
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:37.100]   so still it must
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.100]   be said, the judgments
[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:41.100]   of the Lord are true and righteous
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:43.100]   altogether.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.100]   God has His
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.100]   work to do, much of
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:49.100]   it secret.
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.100]   We have ours.
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:53.100]   If we trust Him and
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:55.100]   obey His word, He will
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:57.100]   cause His sovereignty and our
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.100]   service to accomplish
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:01.100]   His wise and good purposes.
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:05.100]   Chapter 11
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.100]   Loosening the
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:09.100]   Roots to Reach
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:11.100]   the Nations
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:13.100]   Answer 6
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:15.100]   In the
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.100]   coronavirus, God is
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.100]   loosening the roots of settled
[01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:21.100]   Christians all over the
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:23.100]   world to make them free
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.100]   for something new and radical
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.100]   and send them with the gospel
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.100]   of Christ to the unreached peoples of the world.
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:33.100]   Connecting the coronavirus
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:35.100]   with missions may seem
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.100]   like a strange idea, because
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:39.100]   in the short run,
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.100]   the coronavirus is shutting
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:43.100]   down travel and migration
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:45.100]   and missionary advance.
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:49.100]   But I'm not thinking short-term.
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.100]   God has used the
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.100]   suffering and upheaval of history
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.100]   to move His church to
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.100]   places it needs to go.
[01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.100]   I am suggesting that
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.100]   He will do that again
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:03.100]   as part of the long-term
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.100]   impact of the coronavirus.
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:07.100]   Persecution
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.100]   as Missionary Strategy
[02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:11.100]   Consider, for example,
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.100]   how God moved
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.100]   His people out of
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.100]   Jerusalem on mission
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.100]   into Judea and Samaria.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:21.100]   Jesus had
[02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:23.100]   instructed His disciples to
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:25.100]   take the gospel to all the world,
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.100]   including Jerusalem
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.100]   and all Judea and Samaria
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.100]   and to the end of the earth, Acts 1-8.
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:33.100]   But by the time of
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.100]   Acts 8, it seems
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.100]   the mission was stalled in Jerusalem.
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:39.100]   What would it take
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:41.100]   to move the church
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.100]   into mission?
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:45.100]   It took the death of Stephen
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.100]   and a consequent
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:49.100]   persecution. As soon as
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:51.100]   Stephen was martyred, Acts
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:53.100]   7-60, a
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:55.100]   persecution broke out.
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.100]   There arose on that day a great
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.100]   persecution against the church in Jerusalem,
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:01.100]   and they were all
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:03.100]   scattered throughout
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:05.100]   the regions of Judea
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.100]   and Samaria,
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:09.100]   except the apostles. Now
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:11.100]   those who were scattered
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:13.100]   went about preaching
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:15.100]   the Word, Acts
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:17.100]   8-4.
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.100]   That's how God got
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.100]   His people moving with
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.100]   martyrdom and persecution.
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:25.100]   At last,
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:27.100]   Judea and Samaria were
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.100]   hearing the gospel.
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.100]   God's ways
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:33.100]   are not our ways.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.100]   But His mission
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:37.100]   is sure. Jesus
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:39.100]   said so.
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.100]   And His Word cannot fail.
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.100]   "I will build my church,
[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:45.100]   and the gates of hell shall
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.100]   not prevail against it."
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:49.100]   Matthew 16-18.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.100]   "This gospel of the kingdom
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:53.100]   will be proclaimed throughout the whole world
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:55.100]   as a testimony to all the nations."
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:57.100]   Matthew 24-14.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.100]   "Not may be proclaimed,
[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:01.100]   but will be
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.100]   proclaimed."
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:05.100]   Setbacks as
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:07.100]   strategic advance.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.100]   We may think
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:11.100]   the coronavirus outbreak
[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:13.100]   is a setback for world
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:15.100]   missions. I doubt it.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:17.100]   God's ways
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:19.100]   often include
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.100]   apparent setbacks
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.100]   that result in great advances.
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:25.100]   On
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:27.100]   January 9, 1985,
[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:29.100]   Pastor Hristo Kulicev,
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.100]   a congregational
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.100]   pastor in Bulgaria, was
[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:35.100]   arrested and put in prison.
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:37.100]   His crime was that
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.100]   he preached in his church even though
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:41.100]   the state had appointed another
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:43.100]   man as pastor whom the congregation
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.100]   did not elect.
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:47.100]   His trial was a mockery of
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:49.100]   justice, and he was
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.100]   sentenced to eight months in prison.
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:53.100]   During his time in prison,
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.100]   he made Christ known in
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:57.100]   every way he could.
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:02:59.100]   When he got out, he wrote,
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:01.100]   "Both prisoners and
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.100]   jailers asked many
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.100]   questions, and it turned out
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.100]   that we had a more
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.100]   fruitful ministry there than
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:11.100]   we could have expected in
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.100]   church. God
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.100]   was better served
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.100]   by our presence in prison
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:19.100]   than if we had been free."
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:21.100]   This is often
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:23.100]   God's way. The
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:25.100]   global scope and seriousness
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.100]   of the coronavirus is
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:29.100]   great for God to waste.
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:31.100]   It will serve
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:33.100]   his invincible purpose of
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.100]   global evangelization.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.100]   Christ has not shed his blood in
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.100]   vain, and Revelation 5:9
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:41.100]   says that by that blood
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:43.100]   he ransomed people
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:45.100]   for God from every tribe
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:47.100]   and tongue and language and people and
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.100]   nation. He
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:51.100]   will have the reward of his suffering,
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:53.100]   and even pandemics
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.100]   will serve
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:57.100]   to complete that great commission.
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:01.100]   A closing prayer.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:05.100]   Father,
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:07.100]   at our best moments,
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.100]   by your grace,
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.100]   we are not sleeping in Gethsemane.
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:13.100]   We are awake and
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.100]   listening to your Son's prayer.
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:17.100]   He knows deep down
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:19.100]   that he must suffer,
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.100]   but in his perfect humanity,
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.100]   he cries out, "If it is possible,
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:25.100]   let this cup pass."
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.100]   In the same way,
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.100]   we sense deep down
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:31.100]   that this pandemic
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:33.100]   is appointed in your wisdom
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:35.100]   for good and
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.100]   necessary purposes.
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:39.100]   We too must suffer.
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:41.100]   Your Son was innocent.
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:43.100]   We are not.
[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:45.100]   Yet, with
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.100]   him, in our less than perfect
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:49.100]   humanity, we too cry
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:51.100]   out, "If it
[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:53.100]   is possible, let
[02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:55.100]   this cup pass."
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:57.100]   Do quickly, O Lord,
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:59.100]   the painful, just, and
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:01.100]   merciful work you have resolved to do.
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:03.100]   Do not linger in judgment.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:05.100]   Do not delay
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.100]   your compassion. Remember the
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.100]   poor, O Lord, according to your
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.100]   mercy. Do not forget
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:13.100]   the cry of the afflicted.
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:15.100]   Grant recovery. Grant
[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:17.100]   a cure. Deliver
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:19.100]   us, your poor, helpless creatures,
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:21.100]   from these sorrows,
[02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:23.100]   we pray.
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:25.100]   But do not waste our misery
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:27.100]   and grief, O Lord.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.100]   Purify your people
[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.100]   from powerless preoccupation
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:33.100]   with barren materialism
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:35.100]   and Christless entertainment.
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:37.100]   Put our mouths
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.100]   out of taste with the bait
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:41.100]   of Satan. Cut
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.100]   from us the roots and remnant
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:45.100]   of pride and hate
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.100]   and unjust ways.
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:49.100]   Grant us capacities
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:51.100]   of outrage at our
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:53.100]   own belittling of your glory.
[02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.100]   Open the eyes of our
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:57.100]   hearts to see and savor the beauty
[02:05:57.100 --> 02:05:59.100]   of Christ. Incline
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:01.100]   our hearts to your Word, your
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:03.100]   Son, and your way.
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.100]   Fill us with compassionate
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.100]   courage, and make a name
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:09.100]   for yourself in the way your people
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:11.100]   serve. Stretch
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:13.100]   forth your hand in
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.100]   great awakening for the
[02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.100]   sake of this perishing world.
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:19.100]   Let the terrible
[02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:21.100]   words of Revelation not be
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:23.100]   spoken over this generation,
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:25.100]   yet still they did
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:27.100]   not repent.
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:29.100]   As you have stricken bodies,
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.100]   strike now the slumbering
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:33.100]   souls. Forbid
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.100]   that they would remain asleep
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:37.100]   in the darkness of pride and
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.100]   unbelief. In your great
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.100]   mercy, say to these bones,
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.100]   "Live!"
[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.100]   And bring the hearts and lives
[02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:47.100]   of millions
[02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:49.100]   into alignment with
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:51.100]   the infinite worth of
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.100]   Jesus. In
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:55.100]   Jesus' name, Amen.
