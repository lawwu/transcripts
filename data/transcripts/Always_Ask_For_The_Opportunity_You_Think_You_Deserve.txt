[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about opportunity
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.400]   and what happens when you don't get the opportunity you think you deserve.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200]   If this is the situation, you need to stand up and fight for yourself.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.280]   Let me share with you an example that I recently experienced.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.240]   When a producer from Penguin Random House contacted me about creating the audio version
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.760]   of my book, Buy This, Not That, he asked me a series of questions on who I thought would
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.880]   be the best fit to narrate my book.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.520]   And he gave me three or four examples, all were okay, it felt kind of weird, why can't
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.000]   I narrate my book?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.920]   What's wrong with my voice?
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.960]   Is it just not smooth enough?
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.100]   Is it not authentic enough?
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.440]   What's wrong with me?
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.720]   And so I went down his list and I finally found some guy who I felt was pretty good.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   He sounded like a 10 year old version of me.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.200]   Theodore Chin, my narrator, was a seasoned actor and I didn't look at any of the narrator's
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.880]   backgrounds before I chose them.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.100]   But when I finally chose Theodore Chin, it turns out he was very similar to me.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.160]   He lived in San Francisco, he's Asian American and I thought, oh, I guess there is that right
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.160]   fit.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   So yes, I could have been one of the four white narrators.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.000]   Yeah, I could have been a white man on audio.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.560]   I could have been an Indian man on audio.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240]   But instead, I chose the person who best fit who I am.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.360]   But still, it wasn't me.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.800]   So it wasn't 100% authentically me.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   And so I asked the audio producer, can we come to a compromise?
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.440]   Because I had surveyed my newsletter subscribers, and you can sign up at financialsamurai.com/newsletter,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.880]   whether they wanted a professional narrator or me.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.560]   And about 70% of the respondents said they wanted me and 30% said a professional.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.460]   And that was a surprise.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.120]   But it made a lot of sense.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.720]   Writers are writers first.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.220]   We are not professional narrators.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.480]   Even though I've been recording this podcast for over five years, I'm not a professional
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   narrator.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   Listen to my voice.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.120]   Is it as smooth and silky as you hear on TV?
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000]   Is it as professional as you hear?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.400]   Well, I guess I could try to sound like that, but it's really not me.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.360]   And a lot of the respondents said, writers who narrate, who are not professional narrators
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720]   just don't sound as good.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.440]   It's just a little bit off, and they would rather have a professional.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.520]   So that was 30% of the respondents.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.880]   And so I came to a compromise because I did feel a little bit slighted.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.920]   I said, what's wrong with me?
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.260]   What's wrong with me, the creator of the book?
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.640]   And the compromise was that I would narrate the introduction and the conclusion, so the
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.340]   book ends of the book.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.560]   And by the way, the audio book is about 12 hours and 50 minutes long.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.780]   So it's a really long book.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.080]   It's packed with a lot of information.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.580]   If you get the audio, you're going to enjoy driving across the country with it, but you
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.920]   won't be able to see the charts and the art if you were to buy a hardcover.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.200]   So that was a good compromise, I thought.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.280]   If listeners really hated my voice, then they could go to the professional for the meat
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.500]   of the book.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.460]   And if listeners didn't like the professional, which I do believe they will like the professional
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.300]   narrator, at least I tried and offered almost 45 minutes of my own voice.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.480]   So the lesson here is to speak up for opportunities you think you deserve.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.300]   As you go through life, you will probably be slighted, disrespected, and passed over
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.380]   for things you deserve.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.380]   Therefore, to try to even the playing field, you must speak up.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.380]   And also don't take things too personally.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.540]   As a writer, I like to be really introspective.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.300]   I wrote a new post called "How to Convince Someone You're Bad When You're Actually Pretty
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.780]   Good" and it's a story about how a teammate disrespected me after doing very well in the
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.020]   regular season for my tennis league.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.780]   I could have been all disgruntled and felt bad about myself for not getting the respect
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.500]   that I thought I deserved after having an 83% winning season.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.580]   But instead, I turned it around.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.720]   I looked at the negative as a positive to think, "Hmm, if I could learn how to position
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.300]   myself as a mediocre player, as someone who is not a threat, I could then surprise on
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.380]   the upside and outperform and win."
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.500]   If you've ever watched any Chinese drama based out of mainland China, I don't know why you
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.960]   would but I do because I like to practice my Mandarin, you'll notice that all the actors
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.660]   and actresses are dubbed.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.060]   They are dubbed.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.060]   And why is that?
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.540]   Well, the reason why is because China is a big country with over 1.2 billion people and
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.500]   there are different accents and dialects of the Chinese language all throughout the country.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.260]   And the actors and actresses hail from all throughout the country.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.380]   So they want to formalize the sound, the narration, the voices, so that when people listen, they're
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.300]   listening to "proper Chinese dialect and accents."
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.340]   So I thought that was really fascinating.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.980]   But that's also interesting, right?
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.100]   Because the audio producer didn't think my voice was the proper American accent.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.660]   And maybe it's because of my name.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.260]   Maybe it's because of what I look like.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260]   I'm not sure.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.140]   But again, I fought for myself to speak up for my own book.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.100]   And I hope you enjoy listening to it.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.360]   And I hope you enjoy reading it.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.720]   If you pick up a hard copy, which will count towards the bestsellers list, you'll be able
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.940]   to see all the beautiful art by Colleen Kong Savage and the graphs and charts that I created.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.360]   And if you order the audio version, I really believe you'll enjoy the hybrid narration.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.140]   It's a long audio book, folks, over 12 hours long.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.660]   So if you are driving across state or going to that next three or four hour road trip,
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.540]   I think you'll really enjoy it.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.380]   So please, the next time you find yourself in a funny situation, a hairy situation where
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.860]   you think you deserve an opportunity, please stand up.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.900]   Please speak up and ask them, "Why not me?
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.020]   Why not me too?"
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.460]   Ask yourself, "Why not me too?"
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.900]   Because chances are, you deserve it.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.900]   Thanks so much.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:42.340]   And you can pick up any version you want of Buy This, Not That at FinancialSamurai.com/btnt.
