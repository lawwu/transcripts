[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   Here we are at episode number 200 in the Ask Pastor John podcast series, and what
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.680]   grace and kindness from the Lord to have shown us such favor on this little
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560]   podcast. And in episode number 200, "It's Appropriately Epic," is a question that we
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.120]   get all the time, weekly, from listeners who send us emails. And here it is, Pastor
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.840]   John. "Is drinking alcohol a sin?" Let me start by putting my biases on the
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.520]   table, okay? My background, my biases, because everybody's influenced, right, by
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.640]   their family and experiences they've had. I'm a default, default teetotaler. And
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.560]   what that means is, if I have my choice, I don't drink alcohol. But I might, to be
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.120]   a good guest. In other words, that's my little experience of freedom in
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.040]   Christ. In Germany, I'm not gonna make a pain in myself.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.040]   They put something on the table. I'm gonna do my best to manage it for their,
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.880]   to honor them as my guest. I want to let love be the guide, and love inclines me
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.000]   away from alcohol in our day. But here's the nuanced answer, and a
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.120]   little bit of why I've chosen this path for myself, and don't make it a
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.000]   requirement for everybody. The first answer is, that I would give, "Is it a sin
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.320]   to drink alcohol?" is the same answer I'd give to, "Is it a sin to drink water?" And
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.520]   the answer is, it could be. Drinking water when you should be giving a glass to
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.760]   someone else in need, that's sin. Drinking water when you should be paying more
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   reverence to the preaching of God's Word, that's a sin. Drinking water when
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.160]   someone just warned you it's contaminated, it might kill you, that's
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.760]   sin. So drinking water can be sin, and presumably then alcohol could be sin. But
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.240]   it may not be. I mean, Jesus made wine for the marriage at Cana, and I presume he
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.280]   made it because he expected people to drink it, and he didn't want to
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.520]   participate in their sin. Paul told Timothy to drink it medicinally. The
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.960]   church leaders are not to be enslaved to it, which I think implies a moderate use
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.680]   of it. And Psalm 104 15 says, "It's a gift from God. Wine is to gladden the heart
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.320]   of man, oil to make his face shine." So I don't think anybody can make a case from
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.760]   Scripture that teetotalism is required. If you choose not to drink alcohol, like
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   I do, as a kind of default way of life, it's got to be based on some kind of
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.200]   principle other than what the Bible requires of us. So what might that be? And
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.280]   it is remarkable how many warnings there are in the Bible about alcohol. I'll just
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.760]   bullet a few here. Don't get drunk with wine, Ephesians 5 18, or Romans 14. It's
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.880]   good not to drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.280]   Hosea 4 11, "Beware of wine and new wine which take away the understanding." Ezekiel
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   44 21, "No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court." Proverbs 20,
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.200]   "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler. Whoever is led astray by it is
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.520]   not wise." Proverbs 21, "He who loves wine and oil will not be rich." And the
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.240]   most extended statement in Proverbs goes like this in verse 23, I mean, chapter 23,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.480]   "Those who tarry long over wine, those who go to try mixed wine, do not look at
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.640]   wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. In the
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.880]   end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. Your eyes will see strange
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.080]   things and your heart will utter perverse things. You will be like one who
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.240]   lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast." What a
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.560]   great image. "They struck me, you will say, but I was not hurt. They beat me, but I
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   did not feel it. When shall I awake? I must have another drink." That's Proverbs
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.120]   23, 30, 35. So, I mean, do not look at wine when it's red. I don't know what that
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.600]   means, except maybe there's a kind of drink that's just a little too dangerous.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.760]   It's not, here's another one from Proverbs 31, "It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.480]   it is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to take strong drink, lest they
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of the
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.040]   afflicted." Or Deuteronomy 29, "You have not drunk wine or strong drink that you
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.640]   may know that I am the Lord." The reason they didn't drink any wine in the
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.360]   wilderness is evidently so that it would be an asset to their coming to know God
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.120]   fully. So, you get the impression that even though wine was permitted and was a
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.440]   blessing, that it was fraught with dangers. And I would add to those, the
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.960]   situation in which I live in America is why I feel zero incentive to try to like
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.840]   and enjoy alcoholic beverages. I'm very content without them, and here's what I
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   have in mind. I did my ministry for 30 years at Bethlehem, just a few blocks
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.680]   away from Teen Challenge, and every Saturday night, virtually, some of those
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.800]   guys who were in there to be set free from their addiction to alcohol would
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.080]   show up and they would come forward for prayer, and their stories were simply
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.960]   tragic, and I was thrilled with them to get free. So, I watched it destroy lives,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   and I watched the lives being rebuilt minus alcohol. I looked on Google
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.880]   yesterday. $200 billion a year, according to the Center for Disease Control
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.720]   Prevention, it costs Americans, that's $750 per American in health costs and
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.320]   work production costs because of alcohol. One-third of all traffic fatalities
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.840]   owing to alcohol involvement, and so on, with most of the ills of our culture. You
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   can read statistics on divorce and abuse, and so on. Not to mention that it
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.240]   makes people babbling fools on airplanes, so that they get very, very annoying.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   So, given the fact that I'm not commanded to drink, and by the way,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.880]   nowhere in the New Testament is the communion drink called wine. Now, it
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.960]   probably was. I'm not arguing it wasn't. It probably was, but isn't it interesting
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.880]   that nowhere is communion called wine. It's called the cup, usually, or it's
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.800]   called the fruit of the vine. So, nobody can can insist that we are
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.600]   commanded to drink wine by being commanded to drink the Lord's Supper. And
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.640]   given the fact that the Bible is mainly cautious about it, and given the fact
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.240]   that I don't have any desire for it, and God has given many other drinks that
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.400]   don't have the same kind of addictive and destructive side effects, what I like
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.120]   to say is, "I'm saving the best for last." I'm saving the best for when I
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.880]   can handle it, and I know I'm an addictive personality, man. I buy a pack
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.640]   of gum, and I chew the whole thing within five minutes. So, knowing myself, knowing
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.840]   this culture that's being destroyed in measure by it, I find little incentive
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.040]   myself for pursuing something I have no desire to pursue. And let me end
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.400]   by just saying, I do not condemn those who make other choices. It's just not on
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.680]   my agenda to go on a crusade to get other people to join me in this. I'm just
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.840]   explaining where I'm coming from. Very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you
