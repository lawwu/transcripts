[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - All right, the next question we got,
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.700]   advice on setting up the ideal desk.
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.900]   - I'd like to get your advice on an ideal desk set up
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100]   to do deep work.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.180]   I have a standing desk that I vary at different heights
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.720]   as well as different chairs,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.920]   but nothing seems to make me very comfortable.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.360]   I have chronic back issues, but they're aggravated
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.840]   depending on how I'm sitting and standing.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.720]   I can't seem to find something that works
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.160]   and I've toyed with getting a different desk or chair.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.200]   It really is important that I'm somewhat comfortable
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.400]   for the deep work I'm trying to do.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   Is there anything that you suggest or that you've used
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.520]   so that you can sit and do deep work or stand?
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.360]   Thank you.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.440]   - Well, okay, there's a couple of different issues here.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.880]   There's the desk issue,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.700]   and then there's the nature of deep work efforts themselves.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.380]   Now, in your situation, what I might recommend
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.380]   is moving away from the model of here is my work location,
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.840]   this room, this desk, and this is where I am,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.080]   and this is where I do my work.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.620]   There was a period, I don't remember what year it was,
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.640]   but there was a period where I was doing a lot of posts
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.680]   on my newsletter and blog, so calnewport.com/blog
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.840]   about, I think I called it adventure work.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.880]   And I had a photo documentation of this.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.880]   And what I would do is identify a series of locations
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.320]   around the Georgetown campus.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.360]   I would rotate between these different locations
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.420]   to do different types of work.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.800]   And I had this whole theory about, it's nice,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.000]   it changes the context.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.920]   You go somewhere just to do one type of work.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.520]   That's all you're focusing on,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.840]   as opposed to being at the same desk
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.360]   where you also do emails, where you also do Zoom calls.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.780]   And I documented, here is a picnic table in the woods.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.640]   That was literally one of them.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.880]   Here is a library, the bioethical library,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.080]   that's another one.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.160]   Here is a overlook of the Potomac
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860]   where you can sit on a bench and get work done.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.880]   I took photos of these.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.840]   And if you Google study hacks adventure work,
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.680]   you'll probably find it.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.820]   That might be more what you should be looking for here.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.320]   A more peripatetic, so you're moving more,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.240]   diverse location style work.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.880]   I walk and think, then sit down in this location
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.700]   and do work.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.760]   Then I get up and walk and think, go somewhere else.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.160]   I'm in that location, I do work.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.440]   I'm never in one place for a long period of time.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.640]   I like that style of work.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.440]   I do a lot of that.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.280]   And if you have back issues,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.620]   it could really be a good option.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   Now you also mentioned ideal desk.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.860]   So that gives me an excuse to talk about something
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.220]   I'm really excited about.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.820]   So it's a desk nerd geek out
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.520]   that I do wanna have briefly.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.700]   So look, I'm not someone who spends a lot of money.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.060]   I'm not, I don't drive fancy cars.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.280]   I don't have multiple houses.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   But the one thing that we are investing some book money in,
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.540]   my wife and I, is we're taking my study,
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.940]   it's not my study, it's the study.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.620]   We do schoolwork in there, we do reading time in there.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.300]   And we're doing a really cool renovation of that study,
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   which is built around these custom four wall
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.060]   built in bookcases that are gonna be full of books.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.700]   And there's a fireplace with a leather Chesterfield couch
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.420]   and a game table.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.020]   And like, it's cool, right?
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.020]   I mean, but the centerpiece of this,
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.100]   and it's the one indulgence I would say I've had
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.500]   with some of the success for my books
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.100]   is I'm having custom built a desk,
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.060]   being custom built by a company in Maine
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.860]   that hand builds primarily reading tables
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.380]   for university libraries.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.340]   So they pick out the trees and the wood
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.300]   and they build these very durable, beautiful
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.140]   American made reading tables for university libraries.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.980]   And they're custom building me a deep work desk
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.260]   that's gonna fit three sides around it, built in bookcases.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.620]   And then the middle is gonna be this custom built desk
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.300]   where I gave all the specifications,
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.740]   chose the wood and all the features.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.580]   It won't be done till July, right?
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.420]   I mean, this stuff takes time
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.700]   and it's a ridiculous thing in some sense, right?
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.980]   It's a ridiculous thing to spend money on.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.060]   It's definitely not necessary, but it's my one indulgence
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.660]   is that my custom built a university style reading desk.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.700]   And I'll tell you this about it.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.180]   There's not gonna be a computer on that desk.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.860]   There's gonna be a really nice reading lamp.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.780]   I will be willing to bring a laptop to that desk
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.740]   if I want to write at it, but then that laptop goes away.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.220]   So it's gonna be independent from any sort of
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.220]   permanent electronic productivity tool.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.860]   I wanna sit there and work with my notebooks
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.580]   and I could write there if I wanna write,
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.380]   but then move that laptop when I don't wanna write,
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.500]   work longhand there when I wanna work longhand there.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.260]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.340]   So I'm a big believer in desk.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.660]   My bigger point here being,
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.180]   and I've had a series of newsletter essays
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.460]   about this recently in November of 2021,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.020]   I had a series of newsletter essays
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.100]   about interesting workspaces that people built.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.780]   I talked about Ian Colfer, who wrote the Artemis Fowl series,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.700]   super best-selling kids series,
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.020]   the writing shed he built in his backyard.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.020]   And I wrote about George Lucas's writing tower,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.820]   this tower he had built onto the first Victorian house
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.780]   he owned in Marin County.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.740]   And he built this tower with a view of Mount Tam
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.380]   and he wrote the first Star Wars in there.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.540]   On a desk, by the way, made out of three desks.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.940]   So it just goes to show a desk doesn't have to be fancy.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.860]   And my point in that whole series was,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.660]   it's not a crazy thing to invest money in
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.180]   if you have money to invest,
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.700]   is over-the-top workspaces.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.660]   Because it gives you a huge return
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.140]   if you're in a line of work
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.500]   where there is a huge variety
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.900]   in the quality of intellectual output that can be produced
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.780]   and better quality is gonna give you better returns.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.940]   If you write books for a living,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.060]   if you write movies for a living,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.420]   if you solve proofs for a living,
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.180]   if you have to have huge insights for a living,
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.660]   it's not a frivolous investment
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.420]   if you have the money to get a very nice desk
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.220]   or to built in bookcases
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.220]   or convert a garden shed into a writing shed
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.180]   or in the rundown house you bought
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.540]   with your money from American graffiti
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.820]   to put a tower on it
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.740]   so you can go up there and concentrate more on Star Wars.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.140]   These are bets that could really pay off.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.220]   And we don't talk enough about them
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.820]   'cause we don't care about the human brain enough
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.660]   when it comes to work.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.660]   We just think about tools.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.380]   Do you have the right computer and the right software,
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.260]   but environment matters.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.660]   And so I geek out about desks.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.500]   I don't know.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.340]   Is that crazy, Jesse?
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.100]   What do you think to spend kind of stupid amounts of money
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.940]   on a piece of wood?
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.980]   - Not at all.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.540]   I mean, a hundred percent.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.220]   I think you said it best.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.860]   You don't, I don't think you spend much money
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.700]   on other stuff.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.420]   So like at some point you got to spend money on some things.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.660]   Like I spend a lot of money on golf, but yeah.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.100]   - And we have a pretty nice, our table here,
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.420]   I spent, it's not super nice, but we got a nice,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.460]   you can't see it on camera,
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.260]   but Jesse and I are sitting at a,
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.660]   it's like a round, nice wood table
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.100]   with a sort of like metal pedestal,
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.900]   sort of like a, what's that guy's name?
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.300]   Charlie Rose style setup.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.100]   - It's got a good feel to it too.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.940]   Like it's nice.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.780]   - Yeah, solid.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.140]   It's not in the, after all that work,
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.260]   it's not in any of the camera shots,
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.620]   but you know, we know it.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.460]   We know it.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.300]   We're happy about it.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
