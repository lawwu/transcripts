[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.460]   - Pastor John, you addressed ghostwriting back in July.
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.580]   That was an Ask Pastor John episode 129,
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.900]   and there you strongly opposed ghostwriting,
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.420]   and you continue to strongly oppose ghostwriting
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.160]   in all of its forms.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.780]   But you recently mentioned that you have more to say
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.460]   on ghostwriting than what we covered in that podcast episode
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.820]   so please share with us your new thinking here.
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.780]   - First of all, this is not about Mark Driscoll.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.540]   Mark is a friend and he's dealt graciously with me
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.660]   over the years and I wanna do the same for him.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.980]   I don't know how Mark does his writing.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.220]   I know his name's been in the center stage.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.340]   That's not my point.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.740]   I wanna trust Mark to do what's right.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.540]   My comments are about the much wider phenomenon
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.980]   because this thing about ghostwriting
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.720]   goes back as far as publishing goes
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.560]   and it is right across the board
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.340]   in secular and Christian publishing
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.500]   and in my mind it's a scandal.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.560]   And I would like to encourage myself,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.540]   'cause it relates to me,
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.500]   I don't use any ghostwriters in my books,
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.060]   but I'm tempted now and then
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.140]   to have somebody write a letter for me
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.980]   or something like that.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.900]   So I just wanna preach to myself here
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.660]   and to all the others who care about this.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.480]   I Googled an issue on this yesterday
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.540]   and the first thing that came up
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.540]   was a business called a Premier Publishing Services Firm
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.220]   and the first promise they made goes this,
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.540]   this is a direct quote, first line, you can find it,
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.260]   "Maximize your time.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.420]   "We have invested thousands of hours
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.460]   "to find the best ghostwriters in the business."
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.620]   Close quote.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.060]   In other words, come to us,
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.340]   we'll get your book published
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.880]   and you don't even have to write it,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.140]   just sign it and that's the way the world runs.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.820]   That's not, Tony, I don't think that's the way of Christ
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.380]   and I wanna encourage us against that.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.500]   I had a seminary teacher who told us
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.820]   that he wrote books for famous evangelicals
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.860]   whose books gave not the slightest indication
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.940]   of his involvement.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.960]   I could go right to the person and right to the leader,
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.700]   some of them are still living today,
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.300]   and make the connection there.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.460]   And so I ask, where does this practice come from?
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.700]   And I'll tell you where I think it comes from.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.020]   It comes from the love of money over truth.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.020]   Big names sell books, ghostwriters don't sell.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.960]   So to sell books and make money,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.480]   you conceal the real writer.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.780]   Believe me, I mean, I hope everybody would see this.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.580]   If books sold more copies
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.800]   by putting the name of the ghostwriter on the cover,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.120]   it would be on the cover.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000]   Nobody doubts that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.620]   That's what it's about.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.480]   So here's my deepest problem with this.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.340]   When Jesus saves us and puts his spirit in us,
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.140]   he writes the truth on our hearts.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.620]   He inclines us to the way of truth.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.900]   He makes us happy to be dependent people.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.180]   He makes us eager to magnify him
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.140]   by exposing our dependence, not our independence,
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.540]   not our self-sufficiency, not our super giftedness.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.940]   He makes us humble.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.940]   He makes us eager to take less credit and give more credit.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.520]   So here's my question
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.960]   for everybody who's tempted in this direction.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.140]   Why are so many big name authors asking this?
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.100]   How much is legally and ethically legitimate
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.960]   to conceal about how I write?
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   Instead of asking, how many people can I thank
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.840]   in as many ways as possible
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.740]   for the part they played in this book?
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.320]   Why aren't they asking, how can I increase my joy
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.800]   by giving the most credit possible
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.880]   to all the help I received?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.120]   Why aren't they asking, how can I maximize
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.580]   the exposure of my dependence on God's grace
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.040]   in the work of other people?
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   How can I look as dependent as I really am?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.840]   Why aren't they asking that?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.820]   How can I look more dependent
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.240]   instead of look more self-sufficient?
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.440]   Like I don't need anybody.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   Why aren't we asking, how can I boast
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.240]   in as many weaknesses as I have?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.220]   Since Jesus said, "My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.480]   So Paul didn't conclude,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.520]   "Therefore I will conceal my weaknesses."
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.840]   Therefore I will conceal all the dependence
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.040]   that I have on other people
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.520]   and I will make it look like I do all my work.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.940]   Why would we even think such a thing?
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.320]   What he said was, "I will boast all the more gladly
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.860]   "in my weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.000]   "may rest upon me."
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.360]   If you are weak enough to need a ghostwriter,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.400]   boast in it, boast in it.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.720]   Jesus gets credit for your weakness.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.260]   Ghostwriting is the opposite of boasting in weakness.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.260]   Weakness, weak dependence on others doesn't sell books.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.840]   So ghostwriting is the love of money
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.940]   more than the magnifying of Christ
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.300]   through the exposure of our weakness.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.160]   That's my take on what's going on here.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.100]   Jesus said, "True greatness is not being served, but serving."
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.100]   People who publish books under their own name
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.680]   that they did not write are pretending to serve
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.720]   when in fact they are being served
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.880]   without giving any credit to the real person
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.280]   who's the servant and that is the ghostwriter.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.620]   It's just not true greatness.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.780]   It's not greatness in the author, the so-called author.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.060]   It's not greatness in the publisher.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.460]   They should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.140]   And it's not greatness in the ghostwriter
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.000]   who's willing to be used in this way and be paid for it.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.300]   So I urge my brothers and sisters,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.840]   and yes, sisters are involved in this,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.620]   and shame on them too.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.180]   I urge my brothers and sisters to repent
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.140]   and for Jesus' sake to turn away
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.900]   from this sub-Christian practice.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.180]   - Yes, I love it when John Frame cites in a footnote
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.180]   of a thick theology book some paper
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.100]   that he received from a classroom student.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.940]   - Yes, sweet.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.460]   - Okay, here's a follow-up.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.740]   This ghostwriting discussion is pressing to the foreground
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.700]   questions about the legitimate place of research assistance.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.180]   How do you think through this related issue?
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.860]   - I'm all in favor of getting as much help as I can.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.540]   I'm a needy person.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.020]   I read slow, and so assistance seems to me
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.620]   to be a biblical thing.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.140]   The hand cannot say to the eye, I have no need of you.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.260]   I need your assistance, Mr. Hand.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.420]   So getting assistance is of the very essence
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.100]   of being a needy person.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.740]   But a needy person and a humble person
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.520]   who's loved by Christ will want to honor
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.660]   the giftedness of his assistants, right?
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.000]   And so he'll say what they did for him
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.220]   in whatever way he can.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.380]   He'll glory to say it.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.580]   He won't feel pressure to say it.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.420]   That's one thing.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   The second thing is when assistants write up their research,
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:27.160]   some of them are not just giving you page numbers
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.420]   and quotes, they're weaving it all together
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.740]   with interpretation and language.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.740]   And I think that should be called out in the text
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.420]   wherever we are using a stream of thought
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.140]   that we got from our assistants or his actual words
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.140]   so that we're just lavish with our willingness
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.260]   and eagerness to give credit where credit is due.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.300]   And if it gets to the point where the assistant
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.580]   has really produced most of this fresh thought,
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.940]   just put both your names on the front of the book.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.160]   I mean, it's just so right to put John Piper
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.060]   with David Mathis or something like that,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.100]   who's worked with me on several books
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.220]   that have come out of the DG conferences
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.980]   that we were both part of this.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.020]   So those are the three degrees, I would think,
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.280]   three steps that you would follow
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.460]   if you had an assistant working for you like that.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.300]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.260]   And thank you for listening to this podcast.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.900]   With the new year upon us comes with it
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.740]   the lingering old question,
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.140]   to set or to not set New Year's resolutions.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.700]   We'll tackle that question tomorrow.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.340]   Until then, please email your questions to us
