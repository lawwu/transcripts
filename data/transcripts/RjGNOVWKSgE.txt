[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   um, since sometimes your recommendations deviate from the,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   the standards that one would find online or in the typical doctor's office,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000]   at what point do you get concerned?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.640]   Well, I'm, I actually find myself, uh,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.280]   quite in line with the most recent available data on blood pressure.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.920]   And this has been, um,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.360]   obviously there's a topic that's of high concern to any doctor who's taking care
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.400]   of patients who even pays a fraction of attention to the available literature,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.840]   which is that basically with each subsequent blood pressure trial,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.320]   the data are becoming clearer and clearer that the more aggressively you manage
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.320]   blood pressure to be within the one 20 over 80 range, the better.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.480]   So, you know,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.440]   there's a recent study that even looked at going from what used to be considered
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920]   acceptable, which was one 30 to one 35 over 80 to 85.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.280]   We used to basically say that's kind of the first level of hypertension.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.320]   And we would say, well, you know, do you really need to be better than that?
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560]   And the answer turns out to be, yes, you do.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.600]   If you want to reduce heart attacks and strokes B,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.200]   it's better to be one 20 over 80 than one 35 over 85.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.720]   Now this is a whole other rabbit hole that we don't need to go down,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.560]   but it's a total obsession of mine,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.080]   which is how do you measure a person's blood pressure?
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.520]   I think this is potentially, I'd have to give it thought,
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.540]   but honestly I could say top three under diagnosed fixable problems is the
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.660]   high blood pressure.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.300]   It's one of the highest fixable problems in the United States today and probably
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.420]   globally. In other words,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.660]   there are too many people walking around with high blood pressure who don't know
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.660]   it. And I think part of the problem is it's something that is mostly done in the
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.980]   doctor's office and the readings that you get in the doctor's office can be often
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.260]   misleading. You've heard of this phenomenon of white coat hypertension.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.220]   So you go to the doctor,
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.620]   your blood pressure is virtually never measured correctly in the doctor's office.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.860]   He's bold. Yeah. If you,
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.420]   if you look at the rigor with which you need to measure a person's blood
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.780]   pressure,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.780]   the right way to do it is the person has to be sitting like this for five
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780]   minutes doing nothing. Okay, folks. So when you go to the doctors now,
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.140]   you don't let them, don't let them take your blood pressure.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.380]   Sitting for five minutes and that doesn't include in the waiting room because if
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.700]   you walk, because then you get up and walk over. Right. Okay.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.940]   So make them stand there. Right. So you, you want to be sitting there like this.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.060]   A manual cuff is better than an automated cuff,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.460]   but not enough people use manual blood pressure.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.500]   So a manual blood pressure means they put a cuff on you and they actually put a
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.260]   stethoscope on the brachial artery and they're, you know,
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.060]   using the human ear to listen, which believe it or not,
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.180]   you would think a machine is better, but it's not.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.580]   The machine can be misled by different sounds.
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.740]   Now I don't want to suggest that automated cuffs are useless. They're not.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.500]   But when an automated cuff gives you an answer that is, you know,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.180]   potentially suspect, always back it up with a manual.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.620]   I'm pretty relentless about checking my blood pressure.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.100]   And so I'll do side to side manual versus automated every day.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.500]   And there's easily a 10 to 15 point difference between them.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.220]   Maybe this is a silly question, but can people check their own blood pressure?
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.500]   Meaning manually? Yeah. Just could it, could I get it,
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.260]   get a cuff and a bulb and learn how to do it? Yeah, I think so. I mean,
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.180]   I can do it, but honestly, I usually have my wife do it. She's a nurse.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.780]   But it's not rocket science to check blood pressure. I guarantee you,
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.740]   there's a great video on YouTube that explains the physiology of it.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.620]   And if you're willing to splurge on a good enough stethoscope and cuff,
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.260]   like the cuff I have is really easy to use. Like it's once you put it on,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.820]   you know,
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.500]   it's in a single thing I'm squeezing the bulb and looking at the pressure gauge
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.260]   while I've got the, you know, stethoscope on my artery.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.660]   I mean,
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.660]   given the importance of blood pressure and this arteriosclerosis being at the top
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.380]   of the list of risks for dying.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.180]   It seems to me it might be worth the expense. What,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.980]   what's a typical range of costs for, for the quality?
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.780]   I don't, it's not, it's not an ordinate.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.820]   Like I feel like my blood pressure cuff is 40 bucks and the stethoscope is a
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.660]   couple hundred bucks if you're getting a good one. And you know,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.620]   good automated cuff. There's, I, I have no affiliation with any of these companies.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.500]   I use a, I use two automated cuffs.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.060]   One's called Withings and the other one's made by a company called Omron,
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.660]   O-M-R-O-N. And they're both decent, but again,
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.700]   they tend to run high and I have yet to find a credible explanation from
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.980]   cardiologists as to why.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.540]   Everybody acknowledges that the manual one when done correctly is the answer,
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.180]   but I've heard wonky answers about why automated ones are sometimes incorrect.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.940]   And again, it's just made me realize we're not checking blood pressure often
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.820]   enough on people. We're overly relying on blood pressures in the doctor's office,
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.740]   which are not being done correctly.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.140]   So we basically have our patients do this relentlessly.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.740]   So how often, let's say someone buys this, cause I think for $240, I mean,
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.500]   I realize that's prohibitive for some people,
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.900]   but given the cost of some of the other things that are discussed on this and
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.740]   many other podcasts,
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.940]   I would just have people start with an automated cuff to begin with and just
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.820]   start with there. We generally have people do it for two weeks. You know,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.820]   we give our patients a little spreadsheet that automatically calculates
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.220]   averages and stuff like that. Tells them what to record and where.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.500]   And we just say, look, for two weeks, we want to see two recordings a day.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.340]   And you know,
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.340]   do in morning and an afternoon slash PM recording twice a day for two weeks and
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.100]   let us see those numbers and we'll scrutinize them further.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.900]   And if those numbers come in fine, let's revisit in a year.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.300]   Will a day ever come when a watch or a wristband can do this really well?
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.540]   So I hope so. And I'm investigating it.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.780]   I I'm actually going to be trying one out in a couple of weeks with a company
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.140]   that I tried two years ago, two years ago when I tried it, I was not impressed.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.860]   So I kind of punted on it. The company,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.340]   which I guess I'll not share the name of the company just yet, but they,
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.660]   they claim that it's significantly better.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.540]   So I'm going to put it to the test again and it's basically a continuous
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.660]   monitor. So it,
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.860]   it's a wrist device that about every 15 minutes throughout the course of the
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.500]   day, we'll check your blood pressure. To me,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.980]   this would be honestly probably more important. You know,
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.620]   you know how much emphasis I place on CGM as a great thing to be able to test
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.780]   glucose monitor, right? I would argue this would be more important when the day
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.460]   comes that we can continuously assess people's blood pressure.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.420]   It would be an integral part of a person's, you know,
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.100]   health checkup once a year is do two weeks of continuous blood pressure
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.180]   monitoring right now to do that,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.340]   which I've done as well is so cumbersome that it borders on absurd.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.660]   You actually have to wear a blood pressure cuff that is attached to a clumsy
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.900]   device that goes through the whole insufflation exercise every 15 minutes,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.340]   including while you're sleeping. You know, it provides some insight,
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.700]   but it's so disruptive that it's not what we really want. What we,
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.580]   the dream would be like a patch that you could put, I don't know,
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.500]   over your chest that can somehow impute changes in blood
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.980]   flow or something like that and regulate. But we'll see, you know,
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.100]   between optical sensors and things like that.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.620]   I hope that we're getting closer to having something.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.460]   [Inaudible].
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.460]   [Inaudible].
