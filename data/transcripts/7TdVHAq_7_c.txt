[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440]   A podcast listener named Nora writes in to ask this,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.220]   "Pastor John, I am originally from Ghana
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.820]   "and currently living in Dubai, and I listen to APJ.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.320]   "In most parts of Africa and even in Ghana,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.960]   "the traditional marriage rite,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.360]   "where the family formally acknowledges the marriage,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.980]   "is held above the legal or church rites.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.880]   "Is it okay for a Christian couple to decide
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.840]   "to not also have a church ceremony?
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.660]   "Does God recognize this as marriage if we don't?"
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.680]   What do you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.080]   - I don't know the cultural tradition she's talking about,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.940]   so it's dangerous for me to comment on with any specificity,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540]   but there are principles that might help.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.800]   The same question has arisen here in the States.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.120]   When I was in school 40 years ago,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.660]   there were people who said,
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.100]   "Who needs a piece of paper marriage license?
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.240]   "Who needs a ring?
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.620]   "Who needs a ceremony?
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.560]   "God's the only one that matters, not man."
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.680]   And I suppose in every culture,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.120]   there are forms and customs and traditions
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.960]   that have been developed to signify publicly
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.920]   who's married and who's not.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.080]   So virtually all cultures, it seems to me,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.880]   there may be some exceptions that I don't know about,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.960]   virtually all cultures have thought it important
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.920]   for the functioning of the family life
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600]   and the protection of women and children
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.160]   and the civic order and the social stability
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.760]   that there be public ways of confirming
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.200]   the difference between marriage
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.600]   and serial sexual liaisons that some people have.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.840]   The Bible doesn't dictate what those cultural forms
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.220]   and customs and traditions are
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.940]   that establish public recognition
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.820]   that two people have entered a lifelong marriage covenant
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.180]   with each other before God.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.700]   But it is assumed in the Bible
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.820]   that there is a public recognition
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.700]   of who is married and who is not.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.780]   And it's not a merely private act,
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.260]   it's not private to the government,
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.820]   it's not private to the church, it's public.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.740]   And if a couple is indifferent to the customs
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.380]   of a culture that make plain that they're married,
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.540]   this shows that they don't mind giving people
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.700]   the wrong impression that they may be living together
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.660]   and not married.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.020]   They ought to care about that,
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.740]   really care about it 'cause it's biblical.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.860]   That would be a sinful and selfish attitude to say,
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.120]   I don't care about these cultural norms
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840]   that tell everybody we're married or not married.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.420]   Well, you should care about them
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.300]   even though they're not dictated in the Bible
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   because the reality of marriage matters.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.160]   In other words, Christians will want
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.540]   to use whatever cultural means there are
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.500]   to make plain that they have entered
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.800]   a lifelong marriage covenant.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.880]   And the cultural means may vary,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.460]   but the principle is the same.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.460]   Be open, be public about the importance
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.940]   of your marriage relationship being recognized
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.940]   as such culturally and legally.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.340]   That means that God looks upon marriage,
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.420]   not merely as a cultural form,
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.980]   like gotta go to a judge or gotta go to a pastor
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.060]   or gotta go to a chief or a priest.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.520]   That's not of the essence.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.220]   What God looks upon is the covenant established
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.860]   by the man and the woman who make solemn promises
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.820]   to each other.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.140]   So the bottom line is, no, you don't have to be married
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.660]   in a church ceremony in order to be truly married.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.580]   That decision could be made on the basis
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.220]   of how best to testify to your friends and family
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.340]   what you really believe about marriage.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.100]   But you do need to care about adapting
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.900]   whatever cultural forms are necessary
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.620]   to make sure that publicly in church, in society,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.020]   people know you've entered into that kind of covenant.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.620]   - Very good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.700]   And we have talked about weddings before
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.060]   back in episode number 364.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.220]   I asked, "Are wedding rings a waste of money?"
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.940]   And then in episode number 336,
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.260]   we talked about when past sexual sins
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.900]   haunt your wedding day.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.380]   Be sure to check out those episodes
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.860]   in the Ask Pastor John app for the Apple and Android devices.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.540]   Once you have the app, you can browse
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.060]   and search all the episodes
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.060]   and easily find episodes number 364 and 336.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.300]   Speaking of marriage, we have an email from a young woman
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.180]   who writes in to ask whether or not sexual attraction
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.060]   is an essential component for marriage.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.060]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.900]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.400]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
