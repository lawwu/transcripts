[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 200.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I'm here in the Deep Work HQ joined once again by Jesse.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.860]   Jesse, we missed a week recording together, so it's been a little while, so it's good
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.860]   to see you again.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.860]   Good to be back.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.320]   Thank you everyone for putting up with our schedule being a little bit delayed.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.740]   So you got last week's episode towards the end of the week, but the silver lining of
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.140]   that is you get this week's episode soon after.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.300]   So through patience, you get the reward of two episodes being released within a few days
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300]   of each other.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.740]   Now 200 Jesse, that feels like a milestone.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.740]   A lot of episodes.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.340]   A lot of episodes.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.340]   So I think that's good.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.460]   200, we're just coming up on, I was going to say we're just coming up on the two year
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.420]   mark of the show, but I think we passed it.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.860]   I'd have to go back and check, but I think it was probably you started in May, May, late
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.940]   May 2020.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.140]   So we've, we've passed the, the two, the two year milestone.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.180]   We have about six and a half million downloads.
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.620]   Maybe 10 million would be the nice next download milestone though.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.660]   I'm less interested these days in total downloads.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.500]   I mean, that depends on how many episodes you do and other things.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000]   I think I'm more interested in per episode downloads and that's a number that's been
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   going up.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.660]   So I've heard, you mentioned to me briefly that you've, you've got some chatter with
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.820]   the inboxes about people being interested in, in person.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.820]   Do you have a question?
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.900]   So is that something that you're starting to hear some interest in?
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.900]   Yeah.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.500]   Several people have reached out and talked about it and you've talked about it for over
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   a year.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.020]   Cause even when I was just a fan listening to it, you talked about it.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.020]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.540]   That last summer I was, I wanted to do it and then I got lazy and I didn't do it, but
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.540]   maybe, okay.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.640]   Maybe soon, maybe soon we'll try it.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm assuming Nats Park.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.680]   There'll be plenty of seats available.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   He's going to the games.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   We could do it concurrently with a game and you can play an inning cause I'll need a third
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680]   baseman.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   Exactly.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.720]   Like as long as you guys are here, is there anyone who can give us two innings of relief?
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.760]   We're a, whatever it is.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.480]   Aaron Sanchez is no longer available.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   That's good.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   All right.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480]   So we're back in action.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   200 episodes.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   We're going to be doing downloads.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.160]   We'll be meeting in person at Nats Park soon.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.040]   We got a good show ahead of us.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.280]   We've got a good show ahead of us.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.880]   A bunch of questions and calls later.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.240]   I will be doing the books I read in May.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.200]   I forgot to do that in the last episode because Jesse wasn't here and I forget things when
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   he's not here.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   So we'll get to that later.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400]   First though, let's do a deep dive.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.240]   So I'm going to do a deep dive on an idea I've been thinking about.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   I'm calling this the feedback council idea, and I'm going to open with a, an article.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.360]   I don't want to spend a lot of time in this article.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.480]   It's just going to motivate this bigger idea of feedback councils.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.360]   So I saw this article the other day, a listener sent it to me to the interesting account,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.800]   Newport.com address.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.420]   So there was this article that appeared in the New York times.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.940]   It was about CNN's new leadership.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.560]   So this is from June 5th, as you can see here.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.360]   So what has happened at CNN is there is a shakeup.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   There is a new head of CNN, Chris Licht, L I C H T, who is trying to do lots of things
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   to shake up the network.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.680]   Among other things, now that Donald Trump's no longer president, they're shifting away
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.760]   from more of a high energy adversarial style of reporting.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.360]   They try to be a little bit more down the center.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.680]   There's a lot of changes that Chris Licht is doing, but there was one in particular
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.100]   that caught my attention.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.200]   That's what I want to highlight here.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.900]   So for those who are watching, you can actually see the article for those listening at home.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.380]   You just hear me talking about it.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.140]   So we have right here, producers have been urged to ignore Twitter backlash from the
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.360]   far right and the far left.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.380]   All right.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.760]   That I think is a good idea.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.240]   I want to explain why I think it's a good idea, because it will give us some ideas about
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.720]   how the rest of us should be thinking about living our lives in a digital world, whether
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.360]   or not we run a network.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.600]   So to explain why I think that's a good idea, let's start with the notion of feedback more
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   generally, and in particular, the role of feedback for human beings.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   Human beings are wired, neurologically speaking, to take feedback from other human beings very
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   seriously.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.820]   We pay a lot of attention to it.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.580]   It has a lot of effect on how we feel.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.760]   So we're very wired for this.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.800]   And there's two good reasons for this from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.020]   One is tribal cohesion.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.880]   So when you can watch and monitor very carefully the reaction of people around you to what
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.080]   you're saying, it allows you to adjust what you're saying in such a way to try to maintain
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.540]   social comedy, to maintain positive affect between people.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.320]   You see the body language show, "Uh-oh, I'm going into dangerous territory here."
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   You pull back a little bit.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.240]   This helps keep tribal groups happy amongst themselves.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.280]   Now, I talk about the neuroscientific backing for how this happens a little bit in my book,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.280]   Digital Minimalism.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.360]   I talk about how much of our brain is actually dedicated to processing all these complex
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.120]   input channels that come from person-to-person interaction.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   But the high-level summary there is we monitor the people around us while we are talking,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.240]   and we take that feedback very seriously.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.360]   It's very affecting.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   The other advantage of feedback from other humans is that it extends our ability to cogitate
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.160]   beyond just our own brains.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.880]   And now if there's a group of people getting feedback from other people in the group on
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.000]   a plan, on an idea, on an initiative, allows you to essentially tap into the cognitive
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.680]   potential of these other brains, forming a larger collective brain that is more nuanced
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.320]   and smarter than any one brain potentially in isolation.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.240]   This was a great trick of evolution.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.400]   It requires complex language to do it, but once we have this trick, it really allowed
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.480]   us to upgrade quickly our ability to actually think and make good decisions.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.800]   Now, of course, leaving the evolutionary past and going into the more recent cultural past
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.000]   of human beings, we see this extended cogitation idea maybe reach its apogee with the scientific
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.640]   method where now we can formally receive feedback on ideas in a very structured and formalized
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.200]   way that really helps aim our attention towards scientific realities away from some things
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   that aren't.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.160]   So, again, getting feedback from other people is a huge part of the human experience.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.640]   All right, so we take it seriously, our brain cares about it.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.840]   The issue with the social internet, and in particular, the more recent last 10 year rise
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   of widely used social media platforms on the social internet, is that it introduced into
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.720]   our cultural ecosystem new forms of feedback.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.000]   Feedback that we did not have access to before, feedback that is of a decidedly different
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   character than the type of feedback that our brain has been wired to take very seriously.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.960]   So there's really two things that differentiate the feedback you get from, let's say, Twitter
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.600]   or Instagram versus what you would get from your tribe 100,000 years ago.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.200]   One, it's a biased sample.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.600]   So when you're getting feedback from the internet, it's not as if you are randomly sampling the
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.400]   population and getting a true representative sense of how people feel about what you just
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   said.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.720]   It's not just like it is in our Paleolithic path, it's the same group of people giving
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.920]   you feedback that have given you feedback on everything else.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.320]   So if their opinion shifts, then that's probably represents there's something going on here
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.880]   you should pay attention to.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.400]   Instead, the internet has these weird connectivity and virality dynamics where anyone can give
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.080]   feedback to anyone else.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.480]   And what selects someone to want to give feedback to you can be quite arbitrary or unusual.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.640]   There could be something about what you said that got spread through some sort of viral
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.880]   amplification network, and it got to some malcontent over here.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.400]   And then they can directly message you back with some feedback.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.880]   It's not a true sample of people whose opinions you care about.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880]   It's a biased sample.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.380]   It's unpredictable.
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.880]   The other issue with feedback from the social internet is that a lot of it is in bad faith.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.560]   You're talking to, let's say, your sister.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.520]   In general, they're probably trying to give you good feedback.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.220]   It's what they honestly feel about it.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:58.340]   Social internet based feedback, by contrast, has lots of other factors going on that is
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340]   driving it.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.660]   It might not be a true representation about how people feel about something.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.540]   There's all sorts of other dynamics going on.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.680]   For example, if we isolate Twitter, the service that was pointed out by Chris Licht in the
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.660]   article we just looked at about CNN, we see that a lot of the really aggressive backlash
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.060]   or pushback on Twitter, whether it's coming from the far right or the far left, is often
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.940]   about enforcing tribal boundaries, that there is a war going on where neither side wants
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.180]   their Overton window to shift at all towards the other side.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.460]   And there'll be intense pressure to try to adjust or control what is said and what is
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.460]   not said.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.580]   If you look at backlash from the right or the left, what you often see is that it doesn't
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.340]   correlate to how far have you drifted from orthodoxy.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.980]   Actually, the most intense pushback will be for people who are right at the border of
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.860]   orthodoxy because that's what matters is you don't want that Overton window border to shift
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.400]   a little bit in the opposite direction.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.580]   So if you're largely on a team and then drift a little bit towards the other team, that's
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.840]   going to get a lot more attention than let's say that you're wildly against what a particular
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.900]   team feels for.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.780]   Whatever value judgment you want to give to those dynamics, what we can say is that it's
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.460]   not an accurate representative representative view of how people actually feel.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.160]   There's other dynamics going on.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.100]   There's also retribution that happens in Twitter.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.180]   There's also amplification of straight up crazy people.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.300]   So bad faith information you're getting from the Internet.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.260]   Now, this has a real problem.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.880]   And the reason why and Chris Licht is saying, stop looking at backlash from Twitter.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.220]   The reason why the managing editor at the New York Times, as we covered last month,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.140]   said the same thing to his writers, stop using Twitter, stop paying attention to Twitter
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.380]   is because let's say you're a reporter.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.660]   You take this feedback really seriously because we're wired to take feedback seriously and
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.740]   it can push how you report into weird directions.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:02.320]   It's actually not optimal for the information, but it's the hijacking of our feedback apparatus.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.020]   The same thing can happen to the rest of us as well.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.180]   Reporters are not.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.500]   You get that bias sample, bad faith feedback from the Internet, and it can really affect
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.540]   the way you feel, the way you act, what you talk about, what you produce, how you live
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.540]   your life.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:24.580]   It is the hijacking of the human feedback apparatus by a source of corrupted feedback
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.460]   that our brain never evolved to expect.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.660]   So I think we need to be very careful about this.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.180]   We all need to do a similar survey in our own lives, similar to what the New York Times
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.540]   or the CNN seems to be doing now and saying, let's be careful about what we pay attention
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.540]   to.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.820]   Now, a bad solution here would be to stop seeking feedback for our ideas and actions
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.660]   altogether because again, we're wired for feedback.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.660]   It serves a good purpose.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.180]   There's a common effect that academics know about.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:01.380]   I call it retired academic syndrome, where you get a very smart academic that's existing
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:08.380]   in the high energy, constant feedback, back and forth discussion world of their academic
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.380]   field.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.380]   And then for whatever reason, they leave academia.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.500]   They're very smart people, but they leave academia.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.900]   Seven times out of 10, especially if they have some sort of public facing discussion,
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:24.020]   they will start to drift into increasingly extreme ideas, different topics, but they'll
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.500]   get to extremely weird ideas or they'll get very cantankerous or they'll get very upset.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.900]   And part of what's happening here is they're very smart, but they get separated from the
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.260]   feedback mechanism that helps them push back and adjust and modify and improve and keep
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.380]   reasonable their thinking and they end up going crazy.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.700]   So again, feedback is important.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.140]   We don't want to ignore it, but we don't want the internet to drive it.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:53.380]   So the solution I want to suggest is to create your own, what we can call feedback councils.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:13:00.100]   So this is a group of people that you trust, that have been in your life for a while, that
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.500]   have a variety of backgrounds and expertises.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:12.660]   So if you are a tech bro in Silicon Valley, your feedback council should not be six other
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:18.920]   Stanford grads who are roughly your same age and gender and what have you.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.160]   You want a backgrounds that represent things that you might not be exposed to.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.580]   And then take the opinion of this council seriously on decisions in your life, ideas
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.020]   you're writing or trying to put out there, just your personal understanding.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.980]   How do I understand this big news event that's happening?
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.560]   So take that high engineered, high quality source of feedback, very seriously, allow
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.140]   it to adjust the way you think and move.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.180]   But then here's the key thing, ignore other arbitrary sources of feedback, ignore if you're
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.500]   a public facing figure, random comments from Twitter, angry, direct messages, those weird
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.500]   emails.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.900]   If you have engineered a high quality feedback council, you're going to get a variety of
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900]   good feedback.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.640]   If they're on board with something, then it feels right for you run with it.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.620]   If they're nervous about an idea, they say, I don't think that's good for you.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.460]   Take that seriously.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.420]   If they say, Hey, this thing you're writing about, I don't think you realize that it's
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.660]   going to come across to people like me as being kind of dismissive or offensive.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.260]   Take that seriously.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.060]   Now I think companies should do the same thing at a much larger scale.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.340]   They should have large representative panels of people that are relevant to what their
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.980]   company does, their stakeholder, their customers, their shareholders, et cetera.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.640]   They should take the feedback from this very seriously.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.480]   And the flip side is they should ignore Twitter and they should ignore random emails or direct
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   messages.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.000]   Politicians should do the same thing.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.200]   You should be very in touch with a representative sample of your constituents.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.000]   You should be talking to your constituents.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.880]   You should be doing town halls, be getting the mood of actual people out there, but ignore
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.000]   what angry 27 year olds with too much time on their hands are repeatedly tweeting at
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.080]   you.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.200]   That's not real life.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   That's biased.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   That's bad faith.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   You need feedback.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.900]   Your brain craves feedback, but it's gotta be good.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.940]   So anyways, that is my idea.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.560]   Something we don't talk enough about.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.360]   Our brains take feedback seriously.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.960]   The social internet and a particular social media can pervert or corrupt those sources
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   of feedback.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:28.800]   So we have to be very careful about replacing those with sources of feedback that we trust.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   So there's my concept.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   There's my concept.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.080]   For people with not a whole lot of diversity in their social console, what do you suggest?
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.360]   So you have to try to seek out as much as you can.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.400]   So yeah, let's say your friend group is kind of small.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   And homogenous.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:52.000]   See if there's maybe through at work or through family, you know, or a cousin or you do the
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.360]   best you can, but I think you want to, you want to mix like in a perfect world.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   There's a lot of things you want.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.080]   Because most people aren't going to have this many different factors, but in a perfect world,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.740]   the things that I think matter is so professional background matters, right?
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.040]   So if you had class variety, I think that would be useful.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.720]   So it's not just, let me talk to a bunch of other dual income, upper middle class government
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   worker families.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   Like, can I talk to someone who has a completely different type of job?
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.760]   Geographic diversity probably matters.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.920]   I think people feel differently.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.760]   If you live in a suburb in the middle of a city in the country, that might matter.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:32.000]   I would say gender and racial identity probably really matters.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.600]   I mean, gender obviously is a huge one.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.920]   Women and men think very differently about things that don't always understand each other.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.800]   And then probably age, you know, like you have a sampling of people from different age,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   you're not going to hit all of those probably in, in one group, but having some sorts of
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.560]   feedback now, you know, I kind of cheat that a little bit.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.760]   I use informally long time reader slash listeners, you know, like this is the nice thing about
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.280]   my, my online world.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.280]   It's been around for a long time, starting with the blog and then it turned to an email
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.280]   newsletter.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.520]   Now we have the podcast, but it's not huge.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.720]   And it's not, it doesn't have a big social media presence.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.880]   I don't interact with people on social media.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.600]   And so the group of people who send me emails or comment on blog posts and you see, you
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:25.040]   see their messages, it feels close knit, you know, it, it, it, it somehow has escaped the
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.860]   dynamics and I think I shouldn't say somehow I know exactly why it's because all this interaction
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.280]   is happening in the absence of social media with all of those weird incentives it has.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.220]   If you're, if, if all your contents in social media, then you can find these weird bias
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.800]   samples of feedback where your content moves through amplification networks and gets to
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.920]   some corner of people who are upset at you.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.980]   But when you're not on social media, it's a much tighter knit audience and it's really
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.520]   interestingly diverse, um, different countries, different backgrounds, different types of
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.600]   jobs, working class, non-working class, all sorts of different racial identities.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.080]   Like, and then I get all sorts of interesting feedback from people.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.640]   And so it's, it's my secret weapon I think is that I have this cabal of really interesting
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.560]   people that's small enough that it's a pretty good sample.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.280]   And I would say our crazy to normal ratio is really small.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   We occasionally get some crazies, but we don't get that much.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.160]   Do you know any retired professors who have taken done this?
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.760]   Did not go crazy.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   They should.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   It really is common.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.320]   The problem with being a professor is you're smart, so you can convince yourself it's completely
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   reasonable to you.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.480]   That's why they get conspiratorial.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.440]   It's completely reasonable to you that you could figure something out that no one else
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.800]   understands.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.340]   And if you don't have that feedback saying, yeah, that might be true, but you've kind
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.640]   of gone off the deep end on this one without that type of feedback, they end up in crazy
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.800]   places like being smart is a problem when it comes to conspiratorial or weird thinking.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.880]   They either get conspiratorial or they get cantankerous and just kind of mad at everyone,
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.320]   you know?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.560]   So if I ever retire from academia, once I start, if I start going on about contrails
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.280]   and radio transmissions in my fillings, someone's got to intervene.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.400]   Oh, well, okay.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.760]   So that's what I have to say about that.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   Let's do a couple ads so that we can jump into a good pool of questions that we put
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.440]   together for today.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:27.440]   So let me talk first about one of our sponsors, Policy Genius.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.480]   Life insurance is something you need, especially if you have a family, you want to make sure
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.880]   that you are protecting their financial security, God forbid, if something bad happens to you.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.120]   The sooner you get covered with life insurance, the better, the younger you are, the cheaper
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   it is.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.480]   So literally every day you wait could be making your insurance coverage more expensive.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.720]   So now is the time to get it.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.960]   Don't feel comfort that your job gives you life insurance.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.280]   Almost always the life insurance you get to your job is very small.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.840]   It's not nearly enough.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.280]   Now is the time to get it.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.560]   What stops people then from actually doing it is that they don't know how.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   It seems like a pain.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.560]   What do you do?
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.960]   Do you call an insurance agent?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.800]   You go to a storefront?
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.120]   How do you actually find good life insurance?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.220]   That's where Policy Genius enters the scene.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.360]   Policy Genius is your one-stop shop to find the insurance you need at the right price.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   So here's how it works.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.000]   You go to policygenius.com to get started.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.240]   And in minutes, you'll be able to compare personalized quotes from top insurance companies
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.460]   to find your lowest price.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:44.280]   You could save 50% or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policy Genius.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.980]   The licensed agents at Policy Genius are then on hand throughout the entire process to help
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.000]   you understand your options and make your decisions with confidence.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.960]   Remember, the Policy Genius team works for you, not for the insurance companies.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.360]   They want you to get the best coverage at the best price.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   No extra fees.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.480]   They don't sell your information to third parties.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   They have helped since 2014 over 30 million people shop for insurance.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.840]   They know what they're doing.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.680]   So head to policygenius.com to get your free life insurance quote and see how much you
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   could save.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:28.280]   I also want to talk about perhaps a slightly more technical topic that is NAD+.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.400]   So let's put on our biology hats here for a second.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.200]   NAD+ is found in every single cell of your body and is responsible for creating energy
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.440]   and regulating hundreds of cell functions.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.800]   NAD+ levels decline as you age.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.000]   This is relevant to Jesse and I as we are now in our forties or about to be in our forties.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.840]   We're old, old men.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.000]   So we have to worry about this type of thing.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.520]   Lack of sleep, intense exercise, unbalanced diet, too much sun, all of this can deplete
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.120]   NAD+ levels.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.320]   They're also low levels of the NAD+ are also linked to faster biological aging.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.400]   All right.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.920]   So NAD+ supplementation should be an important part of your health routine as you age.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.320]   This is why you should consider Basis by Elysium Health.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.120]   It is the most trusted source for NAD+ supplementation.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:32.920]   Basis is clinically proven to increase levels of NAD+ by 40% safely and sustainably.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:38.440]   It was founded by the renowned researcher, Dr. Leonard Garante, who has worked on these
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.720]   issues for more than 30 years.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.920]   They have tons of scientists on their board.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   So that is Basis by Elysium to get your NAD+ levels back where you want them.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:56.800]   So go to trybasis.com/cal and enter code CAL at checkout to save 10% off Basis prepaid
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.760]   plans as well as other Elysium health supplements.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.200]   That's trybasis.com/cal and use that code CAL at checkout to save 10%.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.920]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.800]   Our first one is a written question.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.920]   This comes from Colin.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:22.000]   Colin says there always seems to be more to be done.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.480]   How do you stop yourself from losing faith in your system?
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.320]   It's like painting the fourth bridge.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.200]   Once you finish, you just go back to the beginning and start all over again.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.320]   So I don't know the fourth bridge reference, but I've heard that saying with the Golden
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   Gate Bridge.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.080]   By the time they're finished painting the Golden Gate Bridge, they have to go back and
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   repaint it again.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   I like this question a lot.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.520]   Now, Jesse, do you think he's talking about, I want to make sure I'm interpreting it properly.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.000]   Do you think he's talking about just there's always more goals or projects or tasks to
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.920]   do and it's sort of Sisyphean, no matter how many things you get done, there's always more
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   things to get done?
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   That's what I think he's saying.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   Right.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   Okay.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.880]   Not that there's always tweaks to do to your system.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.480]   I think it's the first situation.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.600]   Well, you know, Colin, it's a good point.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.080]   So here's the issue.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:20.400]   You don't want an oppositional mindset towards the activities or tasks or projects in your
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.520]   life.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:29.040]   You do not want to have a mindset of, I have to get through these things until I can get
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.120]   to where I want to get, which is, I don't know, having nothing to do or having free
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:38.160]   time that my, my task list, my projects, my plans are somehow an obstacle to some other
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.760]   better state that if you could just get through these things as fast as possible, you could
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.080]   get to that better state.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:53.640]   I'm going to suggest a alternative mindset, which is that man is always in action.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   Activity is fundamental to life.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.640]   Our bodies take in food and water and convert it into energy so that we can actually create
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.080]   movement.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.880]   We can actually create action in the world.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.040]   So the goal of a time management system or productivity system and a life structuring
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.600]   system, the various types of things I talk about is making sure that the action that
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.700]   you're doing, because you're going to be doing action one way or the other is as meaningful
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.600]   and directed as possible.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.520]   We could think about this if we wanted to biochemically, there's a certain amount of
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.280]   calories you're taking in each day.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.120]   That's going to be converted into energy.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.000]   That energy then allows you to do things like think and move.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.520]   You're going to take in those calories.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   You're going to create that energy every day.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.720]   There's a certain amount of energy you are burning through.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.360]   So the question is, what do you want to get in return for that energy?
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.600]   And so thinking about interesting or meaningful things or things that are useful to the world,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:56.320]   being a leader, being effective, being good to others, all of these type of positive targets
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.120]   for your energy is good.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.280]   You're going to burn it one way or the other.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.640]   So you want to direct it towards the thing that's going to make life meaningful, that's
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.800]   going to make life useful.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.880]   So we're wired for that, Colin.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.280]   We're wired for action.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.000]   Your goal is just to direct that action.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.940]   It's nice to take a break now and again, but I can tell you if I could take everything
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.480]   off your list, every task, every project, bring in a whole staff to take care of your
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.040]   every need, you could just sit there.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.080]   There's the hammock will bring you food, will bring you water.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.560]   You're not going to be happy.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.280]   And the reason why you're not going to be happy is that our mind does not expect life
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.680]   to be like that for any extended period of time.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.920]   Action is fundamental to the human experience.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.800]   It's your job to try to make that action as useful as possible.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.420]   So the bridge needs to be painted because otherwise it rust.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.420]   So keep painting.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.500]   All right, we've got a second question here.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.020]   This one comes from Chad.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.360]   Chad says, do you have two shutdowns?
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.840]   If you split your day job and your side hustle with family time in the middle, I work my
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:09.120]   day job and do a shutdown around 4 p.m. and then family time until nine, at which point
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.720]   I work on either improving my work skills or doing a contract job or writing a novel
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.840]   at 1030 when I wrap up for the night.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.760]   Should I be doing another shutdown?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.200]   That's a good question, Chad.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.080]   Do dual shift working arrangements require two shutdowns?
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.600]   I would say no, at least not nearly as extensive as a shutdown as you were doing after your
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.700]   initial work stress that ends around four.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.520]   What I would recommend is that when you're winding down that initial work stretch, so
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.200]   you're doing your full shutdown, complete routine, maybe from three thirty to four,
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.760]   that you prep the work you're going to be doing that evening.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   Right.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.880]   So if you're going to be writing a novel, you get the sources you need.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.040]   If you're doing some contract work, you gather whatever information you need for that work.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.080]   If it's a skill building, you pull out what you need for the lesson you'll be doing.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.440]   So you make a plan and prep what you need so that when you get to that next block, that
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.080]   nine p.m. block that you're doing in the evening, you can get right into work.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.760]   Now when you finish that work, you want to tie up loose ends.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.640]   So if you're writing, there's usually some tying up the loose ends you want to do at
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   the end of your session.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.000]   So you'll be prepared next time.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.760]   Maybe you have some thoughts you didn't get to, you know, you want to jot those down
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.620]   or update your outline now that you've done some writing, if you've thought about it.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.120]   If it's contract work, you want to make sure that you shut down exactly where you are and
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   what comes next.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.000]   So you have a tie of loose ends to do with the particular effort you just did there,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   but that's it.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.380]   You don't have to do a full shutdown routine.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.600]   The only thing I would say in addition to be careful about is that you avoid opening
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.960]   lots of loops in the evening session.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.320]   Don't go on email, don't go on Slack, don't do those types of efforts.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.700]   That's something that might actually require a shutdown routine to close down all those
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.700]   open loops.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.040]   But if you're focused on one thing in that evening block and you prepped it before your
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.840]   afternoon shutdown routine, you should be fine just executing, tying up loose ends,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.880]   and you should be able to move on and let your head hit the pillow after that without
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.800]   having too much actual sort of anxious chatter lurking.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.600]   How long does your shutdown routine take?
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   It depends what I do with my email inbox.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.160]   So if it's a day where I'm saying I want to really get my arms around email before I shut
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.160]   down, it could take a while.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   Otherwise, it doesn't take too long.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   It doesn't take too long.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.880]   So you do that with your email a few times a week?
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.160]   Yeah, yeah, probably a few times a week.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.360]   I mean, again, it's very confusing for people because most people are ensconced in the hyperactive
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.760]   hive mind.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.480]   So I get lots of like, when I see an email for the first time, it's one of three.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.480]   Did you get this?
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.680]   Hey, what's going on?
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.880]   Did you get this answer?
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.840]   I think a lot of people have a hard time just because it's out of their realm of experience
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.400]   with this idea that of course, you're going to just answer my email.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.280]   Like maybe I'll take an hour because you're in a meeting.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.520]   But this is the main default activity for so many people is I'm checking and responding
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   and trying to keep up with emails.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.840]   Where for me, I might not look at email for a day.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   I'm doing other things.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.360]   And then I have an admin block where I'm trying to catch up the next day.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   So it might be a couple of days.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.080]   And then maybe I don't get your email during that block.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.240]   You know, and so I think that could be confusing for people.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.600]   But I definitely check my calendar, check my weekly plan, and make sure I'm not missing
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   anything.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.080]   Make sure there's nothing urgent I'm missing.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.160]   Get a sense for what I want to do the next day.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   Look at the whole week.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.440]   Does everything still make sense?
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.400]   And then I check my checkbox.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.760]   When you check your email, do you ever wish that it was last number of emails or do you
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.200]   like unsubscribe from email?
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.840]   Yeah, well, like, so I'm not worried about subscriptions.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.880]   So a lot of people talk about this when they talk about email overload is my God, I'm subscribed
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   to so many things.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.240]   And I get so many messages from retailers and political candidates.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   And like, that's mildly annoying, but it's easy to deal with.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.760]   Archive, archive, archive, archive, right?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.840]   So I don't really care about that.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.280]   What I care about is messages that require a response from me.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.760]   I don't like, you know, that's time.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.880]   The worst is message that will initiate or is part of what will be an extended back and
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.320]   forth.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   Those are the worst.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.600]   I don't think people realize I get into this in my book, A World Without Email, but I don't
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.120]   think people realize that the real productivity poison is asynchronous back and forth messaging
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.200]   with email.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.600]   We have to figure something out.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.100]   It's going to take us five back and forth messages, because they get through five back
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.880]   and forth messages is going to require me to check that inbox 50 times because I can't
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.480]   wait two days for each of those messages to go back and forth.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.160]   We have to make a decision today.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:43.820]   That's the thing that really drives inbox overload is, okay, we have to have conversations
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.820]   going back and forth.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:50.420]   So there's nothing I hate less than that ambiguous message that is kicking off some sort of extended
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.940]   back and forth conversation.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   That is the poison.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.540]   That's why I like the summer because I get very few Georgetown emails.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.780]   And so I'm not nearly as exposed, not nearly as exposed to that.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.820]   Let's do a call.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.820]   Okay, sounds good.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.820]   We got here.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.820]   Hi, Cal.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.980]   My question today is very simple.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.580]   Where can we find more real world examples of people living the deep life?
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.260]   I think that case studies are often really good at illustrating very abstract concepts
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   like the deep life.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   After all, it's much easier to understand radical alignment with your values when you
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.340]   read the story of the triathlete who left New York and moved to Boulder to train and
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.340]   be close to his family.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.220]   I know you try to share as much cases as you can on the podcast, and I'm assuming your
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.500]   upcoming book will have several cases that illustrate these different moves.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.740]   But even then, that's only a handful of examples.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.100]   Some of them are also hard to relate.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.340]   I mean, not everyone wants to move to the mountains to be a world class triathlete or
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.780]   move to a cabin to be a writer.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:56.580]   I know from experience that sometimes all it takes to crack in your own deep life is
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.580]   seeing someone else's life that really resonates.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.260]   So here's the final provocation.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.140]   If there isn't such resource, should someone build one?
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.580]   Thanks for your tremendous generosity of spirit and sharing your work so broadly, Cal.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.580]   Thank you.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.860]   Well, John, you're hitting on a couple of good points here.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.700]   Let's start with your last point first.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.900]   Should there be a better resource for encountering examples of the deep life so that you have
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.620]   a better chance of hitting one that resonates with you in particular?
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:31.980]   And I agree with your premise here that somehow or sometimes getting the specifics, this specific
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:36.460]   person did something that resonates exactly with me, is critical for making a vision for
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.460]   your own life.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.980]   Yes, I think there should be a resource like that.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.780]   I actually have this idea.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:46.220]   I want to figure out when and how I'll have the time to do this.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:51.820]   But I've had this idea, and I've talked to Jesse about this before, of a podcast called
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.620]   The Deep Life.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:59.060]   And all it is, is each week an interview with someone who lives a deep life.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.540]   And so you just get this real variety of it.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.500]   Now, in a perfect world where time and money was not an issue, it would be really cool
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.940]   if you could edit a podcast like this in PR style.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.500]   So it's not just straight, let's talk to you for 45 minutes, but there's different segments
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:22.980]   of conversation with musical interlude and moments of expository narration from me.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.060]   I think it'd be a really cool show.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:30.100]   I mentioned something like that in my proposal for the Deep Life book, that maybe as I start
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.780]   working on that book, I might launch something like that.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.780]   So I think that's a good idea.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.220]   But let's talk about the broader point here about resonance and deep life case studies.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:45.460]   Here is the reality/issue with the deep life as a concept.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.580]   We know it when we see it, right?
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.380]   So we all have this instinct.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.780]   You read a book, you see something on a documentary, you see an Instagram something.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:00.860]   I don't know the terminology, whatever they call it, an Instagram video bundle, whatever
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:06.620]   the terminology is of someone doing triathlon training in Boulder, and it just hits a chord
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.660]   and it's boom.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.260]   That's what I, there's something about that life that's right and my life is not there.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.900]   So we know it when we see it.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.180]   And starting with the pandemic, I think a lot more people than ever before are noticing
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:25.300]   that reaction and are very interested in this idea about the deep life.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.580]   The issue is that it's hard to pin down.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.860]   And then you look to your own life and you say, I just have this deep instinctual feeling
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:37.980]   that what I'm doing here is not everything it could be.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.260]   And there's these other people I see and hear about, and that resonates.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.500]   They're doing something that I crave, but I can't pin down exactly what it is.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:50.060]   Like I don't know why this guy who moved the Boulder to train for triathlons, this is really
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.700]   resonates with me, but I don't do triathlons.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.020]   I don't want to move the Boulder, but something about that still resonates.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.060]   What is it that resonates with me and what does that tell me for my own life and what
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.700]   type of changes I should make?
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:07.380]   This is the real issue, the gap between instinct and pragmatism when it comes to this concept
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.260]   of the deep life.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.860]   So part of what I've tried to do, I've been trying to do on the show, but I'm doing much
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   more carefully.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:20.260]   I'll do much more formally when I eventually write the deep life book is to make the concept
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.620]   concrete.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:26.620]   What are the attributes that define a deep life?
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.060]   Generally speaking, I'm not talking about particular activities.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   You have to be in Boulder.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.780]   You have to be right in triathlon, but what is it specifically that separates what we
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.500]   would instinctually see as a deep life from a normal life?
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:42.340]   Once we have identified what those properties are, does that mean we can have a more systematic
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.380]   approach to acquiring those in our life?
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.220]   If that's what we're interested in, that's what I'm gonna be trying to do with my deep
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.220]   life book.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   Let's get into it.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:53.140]   There's a systematic quest for more.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.780]   Let's pin down the definition.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.540]   These are the properties that separate what resonates as a deep life from others.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.380]   Here is how you would actually go and acquire those properties.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.700]   So it's a deep question, John, and one I'm going to continue to work on.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:13.660]   Let me give you a one only partially formed idea right now.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:19.700]   Let's just give an appetizer for the larger banquet to one day come.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.820]   I'm toying with this notion.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.300]   This is my proposal for the deep life book that perhaps at the core of what separates
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:35.700]   a deep life from another life is the radical alignment of your existence to things that
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.740]   you value.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.100]   So there's two aspects, and this is a preliminary definition, but there's two aspects to this
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.180]   definition.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.620]   One that you are making changes to align your life closer with certain things that you really
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:54.740]   value and to that those realignment is radical.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:00.060]   So it's not just I think I really value being outdoors and exercise.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:06.500]   So I'm going to start training every morning before I go to my standard 45 minute away
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.260]   commute government job from the D.C. suburbs.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.900]   That's an alignment of your life towards something that you value, but it's not a radical alignment.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.020]   The radical alignment is like, OK, I'm going to is going to be rich role.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.340]   Yes, I'm going to make training a big part of my life.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.260]   I'm going to leave my law firm and be a full time ultra athlete.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.380]   I'm going to move the boulder to be a triathlon.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.380]   Why does that resonate?
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.900]   Because they're not just making a change to align their life with something they care
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:32.900]   about.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.900]   It is a radical change.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.180]   They significantly change their job set up, their location where they live, how they actually
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.180]   spend their days.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.180]   So increasingly advanced.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.420]   Those are the two things you need.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.260]   If you miss any one of those two things, you run into trouble.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.460]   Right.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.780]   So if you make a radical change, but it's not aligned with something that's really important
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:54.340]   or that you really value, you end up, which we saw a lot of during the pandemic, making
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:59.100]   changes for the sake of change, trying to extract some sense of excitement or interesting
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.340]   this just because you did something radical.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.820]   But then you get to the small farm that you just bought in the Hudson River Valley and
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.640]   realize I don't like farming.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.180]   It's weird and quiet out here.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.820]   I can't get good coffee.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.220]   This is this is terrible.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.900]   This is actually not nothing here aligns with something I deeply value.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   That's a problem.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.900]   Similarly, I think is if you're really clear what you care about, but your change is too
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.060]   small, it's not radical.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.060]   It's nice.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.700]   It's better than not doing it, but it's not going to give you that deep resonance of the
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   deep life.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:37.020]   It's the difference between, you know, Bill McKibben leaving the New Yorker to move to
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.820]   that small house up in the Adirondacks, the rightful time about nature and Bill McKibben
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.380]   saying on the side with my New Yorker job, I want to be working on a book about nature
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.100]   and go to a retreat once a year.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.580]   So the radicalness matters, too.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.540]   So that's one of the ideas I'm working on, John.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.380]   I think maybe you need both those things.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.940]   The radicalness unlock some sense of I really do care about this.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.980]   It's a real engine of motivation.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.820]   But figuring out what you care about and making the right choice like this is this actually
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.660]   is important and believing it's important to you.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.660]   So probably those two pieces, those two pieces have to come together.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.020]   But I think we're going to see a lot more of that in the near future.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:20.740]   And for a while going forward, people's willing to make radical changes to do radical realignments.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.700]   I think we've woken up a little bit that we have more options than we think.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.940]   And there's more things we could be doing with our lives to make it interesting.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.340]   What about in cases where somebody like a case study where somebody already kind of
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:38.420]   has a deep life, do you think it needs to be as radical or do you think it just needs
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.460]   there's like different tiers?
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.100]   I just think there's usually there's usually an aspect of radicalness to it, by which I
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:51.060]   mean there's just a part of their life that is unusually constructed or oriented to promote
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.060]   something that they care about.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.220]   I think the good life is different than the deep life.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.300]   I think you could have a good life like I'm I'm plugged into my community.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.820]   I appreciate my work.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.940]   I'm in good shape.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.980]   I enjoy, you know, fine wine and like and have a good life.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.820]   Capital G good life, virtuous, ethical, meaningful.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.500]   The deep life is a subset of that.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.180]   And it's not like everyone needs to do that.
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:22.260]   But some people really have this craving of I want something about my life to be notable,
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.740]   remarkable in the literal sense where people like, wow, do you know what Jesse's up to?
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.020]   Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.060]   Living on a boat or something.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.180]   Yeah, you're living on a boat.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.420]   So do you is that something you strive for?
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.500]   Or do you think you have that or do you think you're living a good life?
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:38.100]   I'm like halfway there.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.620]   So do you want to do something radical?
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.180]   Maybe I do.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:44.100]   We're going to podcast from a boat.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.380]   I got trained for triathlons in Boulder.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.380]   No, I do.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.060]   I have ideas.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.460]   About specifically your life.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.740]   Well, I figure I'm going to be writing a book about the deep life.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:03.940]   Uh, it would be cool if that book could be structured around me doing some things.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.340]   I don't know.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.300]   I even put down my proposal.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.900]   Like, I don't know what these would be, but I would like the book to have a pretty good
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.460]   degree of self discovery and reporting for sure.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.060]   The book is going to be very journalistic.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:24.340]   So in maybe a Michael Pollan style, it's me on the road doing things with people.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.700]   That's a different style than my norm.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.100]   My books, uh, up to now, including slow productivity is less first-person journalistic.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.300]   So good.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:31.780]   They can't ignore.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.700]   You had some first-person journalism in it for sure.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:40.100]   But since then I've, I've, uh, my, my, my structure is usually non-first-person journalistic.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.420]   It's more reporting on ideas and laying out frameworks.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.020]   There's a little bit of first-person.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:53.140]   I guess in, in digital minimalism too, but the deep life is no, no, it's Michael Pollan
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:43:01.300]   goes to polyphase farms and is there with salad tan working on the mobile chicken coops.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.100]   You know, he goes to the places and does the things.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.740]   And so deep life is going to have that personal thread.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:12.100]   I would like to have a prologue and epilogue is built around, um, some sort of deep change.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.820]   So we'll see, you know what I should, here's, here's what it is.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.260]   I'll, I'll, I'll give the preview.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:26.420]   No, this is actually, it's a joke, but, um, I was watching on my, uh, iPad the other day,
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.540]   the North men.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.660]   Have you heard of this movie?
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.180]   I just read about it.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:36.420]   It's like, uh, the directors it's like, it's really in detail and it's a, it's a Viking
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.260]   movie, but like real Viking, New Yorker, I think about it.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.700]   Oh, I missed that.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.540]   Well, anyways.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.140]   Um, so I finally watched it or I'm watching it.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:45.700]   It's Viking.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.060]   It's like a Viking myth.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.580]   So it, it, it did the witch movie too.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.900]   Oh, it's just the same guy.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.180]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.780]   There was an article in the New Yorker, but I just read it last.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.660]   Oh, maybe I did read that.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.340]   Did he do the, uh, yes.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.460]   I like that guy.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.260]   Have you seen the witch?
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.340]   I was reading it.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.260]   I was like, I don't know if I saw, I don't think I did.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:02.980]   I need to watch it.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.140]   I love those movies.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.180]   I love those type of movies, the wit because it's like low budget.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.860]   It just says it's a, here's this little village.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.980]   It's like three houses in 1600s, you know?
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.100]   So it's just one place.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.540]   It's not a $50 million budget.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.300]   Um, that's a cool movie.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.380]   I mean, it's just like, what if like, you know, the witch that period with the witch trials
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.780]   and everything, like what if there's actually witches in colonial New England?
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.180]   Uh, my wife was watching it at some point.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.460]   They're grinding up babies to make.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.660]   So their broom can fly or something.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.700]   And she was done with that.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.020]   Anyways, this is all, all to say, this is a very roundabout way that they get to.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.420]   So this is a Viking movie that stars Alex or Alexander Skarsgard.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.180]   You people might know from true blood and some other things.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.380]   He's six, four, right.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.980]   He's six, four kind of Viking guy.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.300]   He got stacked for this movie, right?
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.940]   Like, because he's plays a Viking berserker and he's 45.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:05.220]   So he's five years older and got, uh, just, you know, they, they had to make them sort
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.260]   of kind of superhero.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.140]   They didn't cut them as much because they're trying to be pretty accurate.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.820]   So it wasn't marvel-y right.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.180]   Because a Viking wouldn't be super cut, but just like, you know, they had to make them
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.180]   just like what he did with his traps or whatever.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.100]   So I was joking with my wife.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.580]   I was like that, this is what I'm going to focus all my time on.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:25.140]   If he could do that at 45, I'm just going to dedicate all of my time to becoming stacked
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.380]   like a Viking, just sort of opera pro of nothing.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.980]   It took him six, uh, six months.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.740]   That would take a lot of time.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.260]   That would take away from your writing.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.140]   He did it.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.820]   So I went down this rabbit hole hour a day, six days a week.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.500]   It would take more than that.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.620]   It got real, real jacked.
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.140]   It would take at least two hours a day.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.900]   Yeah. Well, here's the, here's the curve ball in 2019.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.020]   He was in Tarzan.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.060]   Right.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.260]   So I just probably, which he had to get cut for.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.700]   So there's probably some, he wasn't, let's just say he wasn't starting.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:58.340]   Well, you already work out for at least 25 to 30 minutes a day, right?
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.300]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.500]   It was an hour a day.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.660]   I think it was an Icelandic, might've been an Icelandic trainer.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.300]   Uh, and they had the philosophy, but.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.100]   Sarsgar is a beast, like laser focus method type guy.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.420]   So it was an intense hour.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.460]   They do just one muscle group per day until it's just basically destroyed.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:24.260]   And then, uh, a different muscle group, the next day, different muscle group the next day.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.260]   Um, but you know how much he had to eat?
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.020]   4,000 calories, 7,000 calories a day.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.660]   It's a lot of muscle, right?
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.740]   He put on 20 pounds of muscle 7,000 calories a day.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.940]   And from what I understand, it's not like, yay, let's go get some burgers.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.380]   No, no, that's 7,000 calories.
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:41.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:41.780]   No, you can't eat that.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.940]   Chicken, broccoli and rice.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.340]   Anyways.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:49.940]   Uh, that's all to say, John, that this is my deep life goal is that I'm just going to spend
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:56.180]   years becoming like a, uh, like a inappropriately stacked looking Viking.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.380]   That would be, it's pretty cool.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.300]   You'd be able to hit those rowing times very easily.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.700]   And then, and then just row.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:11.140]   Yeah, just be stacked like a Viking and row, uh, and dress like a Viking all the time.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.180]   All right.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:12.900]   This is nonsense.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.140]   All right.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.820]   Let's get, let's, let's move on to a better question here.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.540]   All right.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.740]   We've got a question from, uh, Joanna.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:25.780]   Joanna asks, what are some deep leisure activities to engage in when you're
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.540]   cognitively done for the day?
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.300]   I'm a professional turn, stay at home mom with three kids.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.300]   I need to prioritize sleep and I'm unwilling to sacrifice morning sleep time for leisure.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.820]   So this means realistically I have from eight to nine at night for my leisure.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.180]   I'm fine with that length of time, but since my brain is kind of done for the day, I find
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.300]   it challenging to engage in cognitively demanding activities at that time.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:50.500]   I would love some crowdsourced examples of leisure that are satisfying, but gentler on my brain.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:58.900]   Well, Joanna, one hour a night, as we've established is enough time to get stacked
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.820]   like Alexander Sarsgaard in the Northmen.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:08.260]   I think that's what you need to do is train intensely with an Icelandic personal trainer
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.140]   to build up unreasonable trapezius muscles.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.460]   All right.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.420]   I think we agree about that.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.500]   Um, all right.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.940]   So Joanna, I have a couple of things to say.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.660]   First of all, I didn't list it in the question, but you told me the ages of your kids.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.620]   They're young.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.140]   There's like an 11 month old.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.340]   And I think it was like a three-year-old and maybe a four-year-old.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:33.060]   So, so let me preface first of all, with you're in a narrow, unusually difficult period in
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.860]   those kids' life.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:39.620]   And especially because you're coming off of the, uh, the pandemic last year.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.660]   And I don't know what the situation is with doing preschool or daycare, but you probably
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.740]   have those kids around a lot.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.900]   So you're in an unusually hard period.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.260]   So let's preface it with that.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:57.300]   The rest of your life starting in a year or two is going to look very different than right
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:57.780]   now.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.860]   So anything we're talking about right now is just, okay, during this temporary, all
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:07.860]   hands on deck, unusually exhausting period of parenthood, how should you think about
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.360]   leisure?
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.420]   And the first thing I'll say is in this period is like, don't worry too much about it.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:18.900]   You know, what is your, your job is you're trying to keep these three entirely unreasonable
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.900]   beings alive while keeping your sanity.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.500]   So you don't want to add another thing on your plate that why am I not getting in my
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.700]   full hour of SARS guard style exercise each night?
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.260]   Why am I not learning the piano or mastering new skills?
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.940]   It's because you're doing something incredibly difficult right now, but it's not permanent
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.220]   and it's going to get easier.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:35.940]   Why does it get easier?
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.620]   Because pretty soon most, and then all of those kids are going to be gone every day.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.420]   They'll be at school.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.780]   They'll be in daycare.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.100]   Now you're going to be dealing with planning.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.300]   I have this time free from the kids that I have different things I want to do with it.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:52.500]   It gets you so much more flexibility in terms of thinking about what to do.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.020]   Okay.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.540]   So, but what should you do right now when you have these three kids and they're at home?
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:57.780]   All right.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.060]   I have a few things I wanted to mention.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:05.940]   One, integrate more restful or leisurely activities into the day, even during periods where the
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.900]   kids are around, just figure out how to do this.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:15.460]   My wife and I have a lot of creative approaches to doing various things like that with various
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.740]   combination of kids around.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.020]   It's not uncommon for my three-year-old.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.100]   I've taught him to want to work out with daddy.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:29.460]   And so he will often sit on my concept too, and go back and forth while I'm doing weights
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:34.740]   or if I'm using the screen, like with a workout guided on the screen, I'll bring him down,
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.940]   give him an iPad.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:40.420]   And I've learned, he's learned to associate like, oh, I get to go on the iPad for 20 minutes
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.540]   while dad is exercising.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.380]   So there's things like that you can do.
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.940]   There's activities like gardening or outdoor activities.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.260]   You can kind of involve the kids in and also just have periods where like, now you guys
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.060]   do screens and I read or I rest, or I push you to the park and I listened to a podcast.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.700]   So make sure you have plenty of leisure and rest throughout the day.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:03.380]   Two, assuming that you're not a single mom, and I don't know that's the case, but assuming
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.180]   that you're not a single mom, I'm going to guess that your husband doesn't work until
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.300]   eight o'clock every night.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:15.940]   So get him doing more things, make that more regular so that you can have an opportunity
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.060]   to do other things, more structured leisure before eight o'clock.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:26.820]   That is, that's too hard of a job to raise three kids all the way until their bedtimes.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.540]   No, no, no.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.540]   If you can get help, you should have help.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.980]   So if he's around, tell him to get off the couch.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.580]   All right.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:40.580]   And then finally, I would say, yeah, don't try to do something super cognitively demanding
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.180]   from eight to nine after a hard day.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.540]   I think you were right about that.
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.580]   Have a little structure for things you like to do then.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.940]   But what are you structuring towards?
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.980]   Rest, relaxation, recharging.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.580]   You mentioned yoga.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.940]   That'd be great.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.260]   You mentioned doing a podcast.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.380]   That'd be great.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.340]   Going for a walk around the block and listening to a podcast.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:00.900]   That'd be great.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.300]   Maybe do a little bit of reading to kick off that period.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.740]   And then from eight, 30 to nine, there's a show that you watch.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.300]   I think it helps to have a little bit of structure to that time.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.660]   Like this is what I do during that time.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.980]   There's a little routine because you get more relaxation out of it.
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:17.780]   But those activities should absolutely be recharging and relaxing.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.980]   I mean, honestly, with three kids your age, maybe eight to nine, the right activity should
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:27.300]   be drinking heavily, but you'll probably get better use out of that if you start around
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   3 PM, because by then it's usually when we're, when we're done, I'll tell you, that is the,
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:40.660]   that is the hardest part, at least in our experience of COVID forget the disease, three
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.060]   kids at home, not able to go to school.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:49.860]   Makes you feel like, ah, probably just to be safe, need to go to the hospital.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.820]   Let me just, because, you know, I'm not, yeah, let me just, I probably need to be
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.340]   hospitalized during this year because, because it's the worst.
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.300]   It is the worst.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.420]   So I hear you.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.660]   All right, Joanna, but it gets better.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.900]   You'll be there soon.
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:08.980]   All right, Jesse, let's do one more call.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.700]   Do we have something?
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.260]   - Yep.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.220]   - All right, excellent.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.060]   - Early retirement call.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.180]   - Oh, there we go.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:20.660]   - Hi, Cal, this is George here.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.980]   I have a question for you about testing the waters and getting in the reps as a writer.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.780]   Let me explain.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.860]   I've been a manager at a Fortune 50 company for over 20 years.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.380]   I've been in various marketing and general management roles in that time and did not
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.380]   have any specific technical abilities.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:39.140]   I'm very fortunate to have the option to take early retirement in three years when I turned
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.020]   55 and focus my efforts in other areas.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:47.460]   I enjoy nonfiction writing and in fact, had a successful personal finance blog for many
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.340]   years.
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.500]   I shut it down about five years ago though, as it was too distracting for my career where
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.300]   I needed to focus.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:57.380]   But with a potential retirement looming, I'd love to get back to writing.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:02.500]   I have a clear vision for how I would like to spend my time when I retire from corporate
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:02.740]   life.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.900]   Get up early, work out, spend three to five hours focused on deep work, writing specifically,
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:12.660]   and then spend the afternoons on other hobbies and activities with my wife, sprinkling and
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.940]   travel and visits with the kids and eventual grandkids into the mix.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:22.020]   My question is this, how do you recommend I test the waters on my writing ability and
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.420]   start to get the reps in now so that I will be ready to ramp up when I retire?
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.340]   I still have a full-time corporate job.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.820]   I'm looking forward to hearing your take on this.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.980]   Thank you for your podcast, which is now my favorite.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:38.500]   You provide tremendously good advice and I recommend you to my college aged kids.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:38.820]   Cheers.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.300]   Well, George, a couple of things to say here.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.500]   So one, early retirement sounds great.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.300]   55 is actually our target as well.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.140]   Because it's when all of our kids will be out of the house.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:02.660]   So I don't think I would retire in the sense of, you know, leave university or something
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:06.020]   like this, but we definitely plan 55 as a key turning point where maybe we'll live
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.860]   halftime somewhere else or do something interesting.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.820]   So I appreciate that.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.020]   Two, I like your proposed schedule.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.460]   That's my full-time writer schedule.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.780]   It's what I do right now, for example, in the summer, something more or less like that
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.380]   where, you know, I wake up, I write and do deep work.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:22.660]   I end the writing.
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:30.180]   This is where anything like podcasting or interviews, admin, email, that happens next.
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:35.460]   And then I shut that down late afternoon and switch over to family, hobbies, exercise,
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:35.860]   et cetera.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.980]   I think that's a great schedule.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.940]   I think we're humans thrive with a schedule like that.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.420]   So I think you have the right idea.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:48.340]   I mean, I might suggest that I think this is justified that you might consider though,
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:54.660]   replacing the three hours of deep work with three hours of Alexander Sarsgaard style
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.940]   Northman Viking training.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.460]   So I don't know if you know about this, but I've been a big proponent of that.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.460]   So just become an unusually stacked Viking.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:09.300]   No, but here's, here's my, my main point though, is it super important that you get
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:16.740]   in these writing reps before you retire, as opposed to, would that not be a great thing
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.940]   to be doing with your deep work time once you retire?
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:28.660]   So I don't know that I would unduly stress myself right now with a full-time fortune
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:34.740]   50 management job to get in a lot of writing somehow on the side with this idea that it
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:39.460]   will be better to hit the ground running, I suppose, we retire versus like the first
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.020]   year of retirement is, is very rapidly getting up to speed.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:46.980]   Now, when you're working on something every single day, it's like trying to develop your
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.300]   writing habit.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.380]   When you can work on that every day during retirement, what you can do in six months
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:55.860]   might take you three years working on the side in your corporate job.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:02.100]   So, so I don't think you're giving up much time if you're deferring some of this training
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.300]   until you actually get to retirement.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:09.780]   So, so I want to plant that seed first because what would I do?
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:15.380]   I mean, if I was in your situation, I think I would reactivate some sort of media presence
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:21.460]   that gave you the chance to be writing and thinking, maybe a combination of a newsletter
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.340]   and a podcast.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.820]   I would use that to develop your ideas.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.900]   Like how, what, what are your current theories or ideas on personal finance to find your
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.660]   voice, to find your niche.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:36.660]   And then maybe after a year or two, if you could build some sort of audience, maybe thinking
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.540]   about writing a book.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:41.940]   And I think that would be hard to start on the side as you discovered in your fortune
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.820]   50 job, it's hard to maintain a regular podcast or newsletter.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.540]   Anything like that requires regular investment of time.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.220]   You can't just do it occasionally.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:53.060]   So again, it might be something you want to wait, tell that early retirement, but then
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.020]   really lock into it, lock into it, hardcore.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:00.420]   The one thing you could do, I mean, you need to find some sort of way to do occasional
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.860]   work as time permits that might help you get back into writing shape.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:09.940]   So if you could figure out some targets for articles, and this might be in trade publications
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.700]   or business publications, et cetera.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:15.860]   So we take an article commission and spend some time for the next two weeks working on
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:16.100]   that.
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:19.700]   And then there's a busy period for six months where I do nothing, but then I sell another
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:20.580]   article somewhere else.
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.660]   And that gets me thinking of writing again, that might not be the worst thing just to
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.540]   start loosening up those proverbial muscles a little bit.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.620]   But the main thing I'm going to say to you is maybe that's what year one is about in
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:37.460]   your retirement is getting back to thinking and writing and finding your voice and finding
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.420]   your message.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.220]   And I think that'll be fine because again, you're not dependent on this to make your
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:41.540]   living.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:42.180]   You're retired.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.940]   You've saved up money to live off of.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:52.580]   So I wouldn't, I wouldn't kill myself now knowing that a big expanse of autonomous time
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.540]   is lurking not too far in the future.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:56.340]   All right.
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:04.580]   Well, speaking of writing, I do want to talk about the books I read last month, but first,
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   before we get there, let me just briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.700]   And that is Blinkist.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:16.820]   So, you know, Blinkist has been a long time supporter of this show.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:25.460]   What they offer is 15 minute text and audio explainers of over 100 books.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:30.900]   5,000 nonfiction books divided over 27 categories.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:35.860]   If you want to know the big ideas of a bestselling nonfiction book, you can either read or listen
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:41.860]   to a blink, which is what they call them and quickly get up to speed on the big ideas.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:46.420]   They also now have summaries from podcast as well.
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:49.220]   So they call those short cast.
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.060]   So I'm a believer in Blinkist.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:54.820]   I think it's a great way to take a topic, learn the lay of the land.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:59.380]   Look at a few books on the topic, read the blinks, learn the terminology, learn the major ideas,
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.300]   and then decide which of those books, if any, do you want to buy and read in more detail?
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:09.140]   It is like a cheat code to developing and exposing yourself to some of the best
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.940]   ideas being spread out there in books.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.820]   Interested in blockchains, get the blockchain revolution.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.460]   Interested is Yuval Harari's follow up to Sapiens, Homo Deus.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.420]   What the heck is that about?
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.300]   Is it worth it?
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.260]   Read the blink first.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.340]   Then you know what you're dealing with.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.300]   So right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.220]   I also want to talk about ExpressVPN.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:00.100]   Now going online without ExpressVPN is like leaving your kids
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.140]   with the nearest stranger while using the restroom.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.220]   Most of the time, it would probably be fine, but you never truly know who you're trusting.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.060]   Why would you ever risk it?
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:14.100]   I'll tell you who does not worry about leaving their kids with strangers in the restroom.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.540]   Alexander Sarsgaard from the Northman.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.900]   You see that guy's traps.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.420]   You say, I'm not messing with your kids.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.580]   But if you're not Alexander Sarsgaard, you would not leave your kids with a stranger.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.420]   Now, this is why you need to be using ExpressVPN.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.980]   This is just a metaphor for obviously internet use.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.500]   Using the internet with a VPN is like,
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.100]   I'm just going to trust that nothing bad is going to happen.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:36.580]   And guess what?
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.780]   Sometimes bad things will.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.340]   So how do VPNs work?
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:46.340]   Well, instead of just directly connecting to whatever service or website you want to talk
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.060]   with, allowing your packets to be sniffed and everyone to know who it is that you are
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.340]   interacting with, what site you're pulling from, what service you're interacting with.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:02:00.260]   You instead with a VPN get an encrypted tunnel to that site or service, which means the provider
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.740]   you're connected to that hotspot at the airport or in the coffee shop, the people sniffing
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:09.940]   your packets nearby have no idea who you're communicating with or what you're actually
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.340]   saying.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:16.260]   You do not just have to trust that the provider you're using or the people nearby are
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.660]   good.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.940]   You can make it so it doesn't matter whether they are or not.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:24.900]   If you're going to use a VPN, then ExpressVPN is the one to use.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.860]   It is easy to set up.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.540]   It's seamless once it's on there.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.260]   You use your devices or computer just like normal, but your traffic is now going through
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.220]   VPN.
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.780]   They have good speeds, lots of bandwidth servers all around the world to connect to so you
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.180]   can always get a blazingly fast tunnel set up.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.620]   So you need to use a VPN.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.780]   If you do ExpressVPN is the one I recommend.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:55.380]   So secure your online data today at ExpressVPN.com/deep and you will get three extra months free.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:02.580]   That's ExpressVPN.com/deep ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:10.500]   All right, Jesse, like we always do early in each month, I report back on the books I
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.940]   read during the preceding month.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.340]   So we are in early June while recording this.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.580]   So we will report back on the books I read in May.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:24.260]   My goal as longtime listeners know is to try to read five books every month.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:31.220]   If you want more details on how I do that, we actually have a video online at youtube.com/calendarportmedia
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.220]   where I go through the different techniques I use to read five books a month and how other
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.180]   people can do it too.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.380]   All right, five books I read in May 2022.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:45.860]   Number one, I returned to Born Standing Up by Steve Martin.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:49.460]   That's Steve Martin's professional memoir.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.820]   I have read this before.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:56.100]   I read this way back in 2009, soon after it came out.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.140]   I wrote about it way back then in the early days of my blog.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:04.660]   It was actually in an interview that Steve Martin did with Charlie Rose about Born Standing
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:09.460]   Up that he used the phrase be so good they can't ignore you, which I then used or adapted
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.820]   to be the title of my fourth book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.180]   So it was a very influential book of my life, but I have not been back to it since.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.020]   It's been over a decade since I read it.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.180]   So I went back and I read it and it was great.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:29.780]   There is a lot I had forgotten and I was able to extract a lot more rich detail.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.100]   And again, what makes this a good book is that it is focused just on his professional
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.420]   career.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:40.020]   Steve Martin's point with this book was he didn't think enough detail is often given
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.700]   in celebrity memoirs about how people actually build their careers.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   This was just about the craft, how he built up his act, what went well, what didn't, his
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.580]   breaks, his steps back, how he moved forward again.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.940]   So I thought it was very interesting.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:05:00.420]   The main takeaway that hit me on the second time through was the power of sticking with
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:00.580]   it.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:07.460]   It took Martin years for his act to break with a lot of steps backwards, and he was
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:12.420]   incredibly focused during those periods on continuing to polish and develop his act.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.220]   And it was actually in the end, the confidence and expertise that was developed by that
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:20.020]   relentless focus and drive to improve that tipped him.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:25.620]   His act was interesting, but once he became world class at delivering it, that's what
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.380]   actually made it a world class act because it was the confidence and precision that's
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.620]   necessary for his type of humor to work.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.620]   So I was really struck by his focus.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.460]   All right.
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:47.700]   Next, I read Blood and Treasure, a newish biography of Daniel Boone by Rod Drury.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.220]   Or is it Bob Drury?
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:53.140]   No, Rod Drury, someone Drury and Tom Clavin.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.980]   And I read it in part.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:02.100]   I don't know if you know this about me, Jesse, but I am descended from the Boones.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.780]   I did not know that.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:08.900]   Maybe I give off that frontiersman style genre.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.500]   I'm not descended from Daniel Boone.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.460]   I'm descended from his brother, which we figured out at some point, his brother who
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.660]   shows up off and on in the book.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:25.380]   So this was my my grandmother, my paternal grandmother.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.500]   Let me see if I have this right.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.980]   I think her mom was a Boone.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:35.460]   So we're actually not too far off the actual Boone line, but not from Daniel himself.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:38.500]   And I do remember that growing up, we went to a Daniel Boone historical site and there's
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.260]   a register to sign if you're a descendant.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:45.220]   And they said, you're a descendant of his dad and his brother, but not of him.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.740]   So we weren't we weren't able to sign the book.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.580]   Very well written.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.260]   I actually really enjoyed Blood and Treasure.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.660]   Must have been very difficult to research.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.340]   I mean, the whole book is about the complicated, shifting.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:04.660]   Allegiances, alliances and failed promises between all of the various different Indian
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:10.420]   tribes at this period of colonial history, Daniel Boone's life was completely intermixed
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:18.500]   with the the fight for land between the American colonists, the British and the various Indian
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.860]   tribes that were there, or this tribe would take over that tribe and this tribe would
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.260]   come in.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.820]   So it was really a book about 18th century Indian tribal politics.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:32.740]   So a complicated book to write, but very interesting.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.260]   These were tougher people back then.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.700]   These long hunters, they would just go like, I'll be back in a year.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.740]   Like I have a rifle and I'll be back in a year.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.020]   I'm just going to hunt for a year.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.700]   Like, where are you going to go hunt?
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:48.020]   Oh, I'm going to I'm going to hike to the other side of the Appalachian mountains.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.420]   And then I'll hunt over there and then I'll come back with, with all of all of the skins.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:58.100]   I mean, these were, that was a tougher, tougher period, but I am a Boone.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.700]   So I get through proxy, a lot of credit.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:07.940]   Then I read why faith matters by rabbi David Volpe.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.660]   I read this because I heard Lex Fridman interview him.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.540]   And I thought it was, he was interesting.
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.260]   It was a really good interview.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.700]   I thought it was really interesting.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.500]   So I said, what's his most famous book was Volpe's most famous book.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.700]   I think it's why faith matters.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:22.980]   And I read it pretty good.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   So this was a, it's a post nine 11 book.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:30.980]   Volpe wrote why faith matters as a response to the post nine 11 new atheist.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:35.300]   So, you know, remember those two early two thousands, you had Sam Harris,
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:43.060]   you had Hitchens, Dawkins, and I guess Daniel did it maybe had a book in there too, breaking
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:50.820]   the spell, there is this sort of anti-religious new atheism that arose, and this was a response
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.220]   to that.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:58.180]   It was a pretty interesting book from a roughly from a Jewish perspective, but, but relatively
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.300]   ecumenical, very accessible.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.580]   I thought there's some interesting points in it.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:08.740]   Then I went back and again, this is a reread, but a reread from my childhood.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:14.980]   So I don't think it counts lost moon by James Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.820]   This book came out in the nineties when I was a kid.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:24.580]   It is the book about Apollo 13 written by the Jim Lovell who Tom Hanks played in the movie
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.180]   and a professional science writer, Jeffrey Kluger.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:36.020]   So, so Apollo 13, the Ron Howard movie was based off of this book was the main source
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:36.500]   material.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:43.380]   Another cool book, they wrote it, they wrote it, narrate, uh, cinematically.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   So it's like in the room, in the room, real time narrative, like this person said this,
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:51.860]   this person grabbed this thing, which is probably the right way.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:56.740]   And it goes back and forth between mission control and the capsule, but it's written
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.620]   embedded in the action itself.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.580]   So, you know, then Lovell hit the switch and this happened, not, there's not a, as not
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.780]   a third person narrator voice of like, then what was happening on the, so it really moves.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.620]   And it's a crazy story.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:18.180]   I mean, what happened on the, on the command module and what they had to do to save it.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:23.140]   And Kluger just went back through transcript and transcript, and they really picked apart
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:26.900]   what happened and the tick talk of how it unfolded and who said what.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.500]   And so it's really an achievement as a book.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.820]   I just, as a nonfiction writer, I can say this was, it's, it's a fantastic story, obviously,
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.060]   I mean, stuck in space and you have to get saved.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:40.660]   But to write this book is not an easy feat.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.740]   I mean, it took a huge amount of research.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.340]   So it's a real achievement as a book and incredibly interesting to read.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.980]   So forget the movie, you gotta, you gotta read the book Lost Moon.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:56.420]   And then finally, I read the Lost City of Z by David Gran.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.340]   So David Gran is a New Yorker writer.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:07.540]   He's sort of, I don't know if he's a target of envy, but he's sort of what you, sometimes what
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.540]   you imagine when you imagined when you're at Columbia journalism school and you're thinking
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.660]   what you want to do as a writer, what you imagine often is David Gran.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:23.540]   So what he does for the New Yorker is he does these long form journalistic pieces where he
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:30.100]   usually goes on some sort of adventure with interesting people with interesting things
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:30.600]   happening.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:40.180]   So there'll be some, you know, I think he did stuff with like white supremacist in jail.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.540]   At some point, there was like a murder in the, another book thing he did, another article,
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.180]   there was a murder among the Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:56.180]   Like there's this whole world of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts that think that Sherlock
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:56.900]   Holmes was real.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.500]   And there was this murder and David Gran is over there in England and gets in beds with
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.460]   these groups and is really like the Baker Street regulars.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:13.460]   And anyways, Lost City of Z is half of it is the story of Percy Fawcett, one of the last
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:22.020]   of the great British adventurers and explorers who disappeared trying to find this supposed
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.940]   giant city in the Amazon.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:29.700]   So it tells the story, but the interleaves with David Gran going to the Amazon and actually
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.820]   putting together a team and going in himself to try to find some evidence of what they
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:35.320]   found.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:44.100]   And, you know, spoiler alert, turns out there were really large civilizations in the, in
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:50.420]   the Amazon, but a lot of it was hard to find because it was built with wood and a lot of
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.060]   that had decayed.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.860]   But now with modern techniques, we can see there was all these sophisticated cities.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:59.060]   So Percy Fawcett was right, but there's no way he was ever going to find it in the 1920s.
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.220]   Anyways, David Gran is great.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.140]   He's the goat at these type of things.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.660]   These things move, they're well researched.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.740]   He inserts himself into it, sort of classic adventure narrative, nonfiction, New Yorker
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.620]   type stuff.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.180]   So that book was fun.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.980]   I should be more David Gran like Jesse.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.940]   I need to actually like go, you know, on the trail of a murderer.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.900]   Oh, a famous David Gran piece was hunting the giant squid.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:28.420]   So he's out there on this boat with this guy, this eccentric guy, he's like convinced that
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.540]   they can catch a giant squid and he's out there in the storms and they're trying to
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.180]   find a squid.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.140]   He loves that type of stuff.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.180]   He just puts himself puts himself in the danger.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:36.820]   Do you know him?
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.020]   I never met him.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.100]   How old is he?
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.700]   Older than us, but I don't know, probably not that much older.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.500]   We should look it up.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.140]   I wonder how old he is.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.500]   I should flex that more.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.220]   I feel shy and nervous about it.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.820]   I feel like I should maybe flex more of the potential ability to talk to other New Yorker
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:04.260]   writers and say, just can I call you?
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.300]   Can I call you?
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.100]   It feels a little bit.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.700]   I don't know.
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.300]   Eddie Haskelly.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.340]   Excuse me, Mr. Gran.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:18.180]   I also do some writing for your esteemed publication there, sir.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:18.740]   And.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:19.780]   55 years old.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.280]   Okay.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.700]   55 years old.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.620]   And I would like to talk to you on the telephone.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.500]   The problem is if someone wrote me like that, I would be like, oh, this is annoying.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:34.900]   So, so I don't, but I'll tell you, I do want to before time is too short and I'm sure there's
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.260]   not much time left to do this.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:40.500]   Just given his age, I really would like to meet John McPhee.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:46.100]   And I built the intro to the slow productivity around John McPhee.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:51.140]   And I grew up near Princeton and I'm around there all the time.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:51.860]   So I'm going to see.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:56.260]   He's probably just goes, walks the campus, walks home.
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.540]   Yeah, he's older.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.580]   You know, I think he's in his upper eighties now, so I don't know exactly what the, what
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.220]   his situation is, but I would love to meet him once.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.540]   Maybe that's one place I will do an Eddie Haskell flex.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:13.700]   It's like, ah, sir, I, I write for your same esteemed publication and I would like to stop
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:14.820]   by and say hello.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:19.460]   And so I'll try that, but I think it'd be cool for the opening of that book when I'm
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.020]   telling this story about his work habits and spending a whole year writing one article
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.980]   to be able to actually be there and see him would be cool.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.100]   So, so I might try that.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:36.580]   Well, as you said earlier, when you were talking about your plans for the deep life, you might
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.500]   be doing something related to David Gran, right?
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.700]   Yeah, maybe I could become a David Gran style writer.
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:48.580]   Well, if you're going to do something deep life, I mean, that's kind of like going on
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.180]   a boat, trying to find a big squid.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.060]   But then he comes back, you know, and then he comes.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.660]   You don't want to stay on the boat for your whole entire life.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.140]   Oh yeah.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:55.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.980]   But how many squids you want to catch?
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.820]   But see, like in that case, that's more like he does adventures for his articles.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.980]   Then goes back, goes back to his normal life where the deep life you got to, you want,
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.740]   I mean, that is a deep life.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.100]   Oh, he's probably always working on something.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.260]   So probably I think he is going to do after that.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.420]   Well, his book, he wrote a book, um, the something, summer moon.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:19.860]   So something, summer moon about this murder on an Indian reservation around trying to
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.060]   get oil rights or whatever.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.300]   Anyway, Scorsese is making a movie out of it right now.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.180]   So, you know, kudos to him.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.220]   That's a really cool book.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.100]   And I feel bad.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:28.900]   I'm getting the name.
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:36.100]   It's something, something, something moon.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:41.860]   The problem is not the, the, not mix it up with a fire of summer moon.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:45.860]   Well, no, but that might be the killers of the flower moon killer of the flower moon.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.740]   So the issue is there's the empire of the summer moon.
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:52.420]   That's the, the Gwyn book about the Comanches, right?
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.620]   Killers of the flower moon.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:53.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:54.820]   Killers of the flower moon.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.100]   I have that.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:56.660]   I should read that.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.460]   But, but no, but David Graham lives a deep life.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:05.300]   Not that the squid hunt is a deep life, but I probably a life where you do adventure journalism.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.340]   Like that's interesting, right?
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.020]   Like it's a lot of these full-time writers, their lives are interesting.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.460]   Like they're, they're unusual.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:16.100]   They, in his case, like he travels and goes, he's adventures and comes back and writes on
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.780]   them and he kind of does it on his own terms.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.780]   Like that's probably, that's pretty cool.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.940]   Or you have like the Sebastian Youngers of the world where he goes to his, with his family,
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:27.060]   to their little house in the pine scrub in Truro, Cape Cod.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:32.820]   And he's sort of like chainsaws trees and writes, you know, it goes to a boxing gym too.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:37.140]   That's another guy who's older than us who.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.660]   Looks like he could beat me up.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:42.580]   All right.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.300]   Well, anyway, enough of that.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:43.860]   How long did we go?
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.700]   Just, Ooh, hour 20.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.940]   That's what happens when I get away from the studio too long.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.300]   So let's wrap this up.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.700]   Thank you everyone for listening.
