[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   Okay, at this time, I'd like to introduce our distinguished guest of honor.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.440]   He's the founder of Vanguard and president of Vanguard's Bogle's Financial Research Markets
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.240]   Research Center.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.280]   He created Vanguard in 1974 and served as chairman and chief executive officer until
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.180]   1996 and senior chairman until 2000.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.160]   He entered the investment field immediately following his graduation from Princeton University,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140]   Nyingekomlata, with a degree in economics in 1951.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.260]   If I listed all of his honors and achievements, which most of you already know, we wouldn't
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.180]   have any time to listen to Jack.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.240]   So I'll dispense with that and ask you to please welcome our special guest of honor,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.700]   Mr. Jack Bogle.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700]   We normally...
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.760]   I'm going to steal a couple of minutes from Jack's speech for something that's very important.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.380]   We normally do our recognition ceremony at the end of the event on the last day, but
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.540]   we've got something very special to do this time, and I think it deserves its own time
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.820]   on the agenda.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.860]   The person we're going to honor today is a very special individual.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.180]   I've had the pleasure of working with him for the past 18 years.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.860]   We've worked together, helping to build one of the old Vanguard diehards form into the
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.860]   number one form on Morningstar, and then later building the Bogleheads form into the number
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.360]   one investing form on the internet.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.940]   We worked together to host the first Bogleheads conference with Jack in Miami.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.980]   We worked together writing the Bogleheads books.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.660]   We've raced together in the weekly Biscayne Bay regatta.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.080]   We celebrated birthdays together, and we spent weeks cruising together.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.940]   So to say I know this person is really an understatement.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.700]   He's an ace through and through, and a real gentleman.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.060]   Since he no longer cares to travel, this is, for all practical purposes, his last conference.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.060]   So I thought it only proper that we acknowledge the great contributions he's made in the establishment
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.100]   and continued growth of the Bogleheads community.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.220]   Jack calls him the king of the Bogleheads.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.620]   I call him my very dear friend.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.660]   Would you all please give a rousing round of applause to Taylor Laramore.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.880]   Will you please come up and accept this award, Taylor?
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:49.040]   I'll read the award.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.520]   It says the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy Lifetime Achievement Award presented
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.240]   to Taylor Laramore for his service in World War II, his exemplary government career, his
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.760]   leadership in founding and building the Bogleheads community, a lifetime of being a kind, decent,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.920]   and helpful human being.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.040]   Presented at the Bogleheads 2016 conference, Philadelphia, PA, signed John C. Bogle Honorary
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   Chairman and Melinda President.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.560]   Everything I know I learned from Jack Bogle.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:04:02.720]   Don't move quite as fast as I used to.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.880]   It reminds me a little bit of last year.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   I have the same awesome vision here, a room filled with wonderful guys and gals who are
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.000]   here as Bogleheads.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.800]   Whoever would have thought that?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.520]   Whoever would have dreamed that 15 years ago?
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.600]   There's only one person, of course, and that's Taylor Laramore, my dear friend.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   Here we are this morning with two founders, the founder of Vanguard and the founder of
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   the Bogleheads.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.120]   I'm always proud to be in his company.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.840]   I really love the guy and wish he and Taffy, his companion, the very best.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.560]   They're a lovely, lovely couple and still taking all the flags and birgies at the regattas
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.200]   down in Florida.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.080]   I'm barely on a boat without a crane, but I try.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.160]   Welcome to all of you and thank you for coming.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.800]   Congratulations to the Bogleheads, Mel and all the rest of you, for I think it's three
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.720]   million posts?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   Over three million.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.000]   I'm always given the understatement.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You all know that.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.080]   What did I see?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   No?
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080]   35,000 members?
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   How many members?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   I'm underestimating again.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:45.040]   I want to give special thanks at the beginning to Mike Nolan, starting his sixth year in
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.000]   penal servitude, who has been a fantastic help to me.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.960]   We work together on just about every project.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   He travels with me, partly because I think he enjoys being in the venues that I'm speaking
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.160]   at and working at.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.800]   For that asset, he has a liability of traveling with me.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.160]   Getting me through Union Station in Washington is not easy, but when we get there, we always
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:31.000]   call an Uber, so Uber has made our lives worthwhile.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.120]   I'll mention at the same time, you couldn't do anything without you, Mike, and I appreciate
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.440]   your friendship, your loyalty, your commitment.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.720]   He's a tremendous hard worker.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.400]   He probably got to the office at what, 6.15 this morning?
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   5.50.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   5.50.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.120]   I wondered how he beat me.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.560]   That's not what it takes anymore, and I'm working as hard as I used to.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.880]   I also want to now thank, I'll thank her publicly later on, Emily Snyder.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.160]   Mike is starting his sixth year here with me.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:12.760]   Emily is starting her 26th year with me, and don't ask, don't ask, and I won't tell
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.360]   how she puts up, but I don't know, but she is a lovely woman, young woman really, gracious
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.080]   with everybody she comes in contact with, a prodigious worker, loyal to a fault, and
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   I don't know what I'd do without her either, and that's it for the Bogle Financial Markets
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.120]   Research Center.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.560]   People think that there's 40 people down there creating and cranking out all this work that
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.600]   I do, or that we do, that I publish, but we do, and no, there are only the little three
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:50.560]   of us fighting our way through each day, which is, in truth, not quite as easy as it used
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560]   to be.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.280]   I still enjoy it, but I tire a little bit.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.120]   I suppose that's fair enough for someone who is celebrating 65 years, essentially with
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.640]   the same company I've been involved with, Wellington Fund, leave aside the names of
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.720]   the management companies, ever since 1951, talk a little bit about that later on, 60th
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.600]   anniversary in the industry, the 40th anniversary to celebrate this year, first index investment
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.640]   trust, somebody actually bought shares in first index funds when I was here today, and
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.360]   that's now the S&P 500 been renamed.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.800]   We were proud to have that first stamped on our name, a time when everybody thought it
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:38.640]   was well stamped, everybody thought index funds should be stamped out, and you saw that
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:46.140]   poster, I think, and some of the things that I've done, and best of all, as if 65 and 40
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:52.260]   aren't enough, you're not going to believe this, because I'm a very difficult character,
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:07.780]   my 60th wedding anniversary, and Malthus being Malthus, our family now is 31, and counting
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:16.740]   in-laws, I don't know, a little difficult when gift tax times come along, and I also
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:24.980]   want to say something important, I'm not going to join you for the reception this afternoon,
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.820]   but that's mainly because my wife wants me home a little bit earlier, because I don't
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.860]   want to be, you know, as if I'm spying on people, I've been asked three or four times
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:41.460]   to come, invited, no question about that, and it's going to be run by, the moderator
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.860]   is going to be one of our bright, up-and-coming young managing directors named Chris McIsaac,
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.500]   who's become a good friend of mine over time, and I'm really a great admirer of Chris's,
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.700]   and you'll see him in action, and Mike will report to me whether he does a good job or
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.140]   not, and I don't think I won't be watching, and I also want to say one of the best things
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:09.980]   that's happened this year, I want to try and say this tactfully, is that we've come together,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.940]   the Vanguard management, present management, and I have come together, and we have kind
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:22.980]   of mutual harmony, all the arguments have been settled and put aside, and so it's the
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.940]   best relationship I've had with Vanguard, which has been, as everybody knows, I think,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:33.660]   a bit rocky along the way, to say the least, and so that's another highlight.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.260]   So this has been a good year for me, and I'm happy to be with you to talk a little bit
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.940]   about that.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.900]   It's been a year when, oh wait, I've got that up there, when I got a couple of nice headlines,
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:54.140]   I want to flip that slide, right, to that article in the Wall Street Journal, which
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.020]   I must say, it just couldn't have been nicer in every way.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.180]   I don't know where the hair went in front of my head, I know it on the lot, but I've
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.340]   got more than that!
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.580]   But Holman liked it, Holman Shangothy, author, I guess, gets approval rights, I don't know
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.640]   where he got that ghastly sweater and jacket, but I have been known to wear a tweed anyway,
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   so it's a good try.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.020]   It was really nice.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.240]   One of the non-highlights, I don't know where this comes from, but people comment on these
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:35.080]   articles in the press now, and this one got, I think, around 220 comments, and too many
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:42.640]   of them, maybe as many as 15 or 20, really did not like the article.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:50.360]   How could you ever vote for Hillary?
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.840]   And one of them was a little biting, and said, "If you're that dumb, I'm glad you're not
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.160]   running Vanguard anymore.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.240]   It goes with the territory!"
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.640]   And just to be honest, I don't like answering political questions with that kind of question,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.040]   but I build name and reputation for integrity and candor, and I'm not about to say I'm not
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.880]   going to answer your question, which is not my style, it gets me in trouble a lot, but
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:23.680]   I think the payoff is getting the respect of people for speaking as honestly as I can.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.240]   Who else is interviewing me or talking to me?
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.080]   So that was a nice one.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:37.160]   And then there was this business of indexing is worse than Marxism.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:47.000]   And it was quite a diatribe, only about 40 pages, and published by Sanford Bernstein
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.600]   Company, a big investment advisor and broker, and they can't stand indexing.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.760]   So they got somebody to write an article, one of their staff, who said it was going
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   to ruin the world.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   It seems to me it's more likely to save the world, but that's another story.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.240]   But my good friend Cliff Asness, the head of AQR, a huge hedge fund manager, they probably
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:18.160]   run, I don't know, $80 billion, and he wrote a rebuttal to the article in Bloomberg where
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.120]   the article first appeared, and he said indexing is capitalism at best.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.640]   He got it.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.680]   And I take some pride in having friends in the hedge fund business, and if they're doing
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.640]   a good job and have the right posture and integrity and all that, I have no problem
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   admiring them.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:45.600]   Well, Cliff describes himself as Jack Bogle's least hated hedge fund manager.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.680]   I think my son would be in that category, too.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.800]   So it says at the bottom, all that glitters is not gold, but it is gold.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.960]   And I just thought I'd mention a little bit, I don't know, bragging, a couple of gold medals,
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.480]   one that I got and one that I will receive.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.080]   You heard about the first one, the Gold Medal for Distinguished Service to Society, which
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:18.200]   is pretty big, and the Pennsylvania has a big party in New York every December for about
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:25.360]   110 years, 115, I think it is, and the first award winner was Andrew Carnegie, who's older
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.240]   than I am, if you can believe that, and getting these awards basically for telling the truth,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.800]   spreading the word, and that I do.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.560]   No question about that.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:44.160]   It's all about simple stuff, common-sense investing, in the title of two of my books,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.560]   sound investment principles, investment costs and returns, trust, and the role of integrity,
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.640]   which has come into sharp relief with that really bad piece of work done by Wells Fargo.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:07.000]   The bank probably had the best reputation, had the best reputation of any bank in the
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   country.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.280]   And so that can happen to anybody, any time, and I spent a lot of my time here in the incipient
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.480]   years, the early years, trying to make sure I touched every base.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:24.120]   You know, I could be around, we started Vanguard with 28 people, that's about that table and
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.160]   that table and that table, and maybe one more.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.400]   And so I was on top of everything, all of the details, I loved the details of the business.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.120]   And I was watching, I was listening, to make sure that very kind of thing, we didn't have
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.600]   any incentives for selling more, people on the phones don't get paid if you send us money,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.280]   I can't imagine anything more idiotic, anything that was more cutting to your integrity.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   So I've put in 60 years, 65 years, and how many hits have I had and how many errors have
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.840]   I been through, just about all of them.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.080]   And as you saw this chart last year, I've seen this go from an industry that sells what
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.560]   it makes to an industry that makes what it sells.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.240]   I won't spend a lot of time on this list, you can see them up there, but all these different
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.440]   things we've fought through.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:20.920]   And starting Vanguard in the middle of all this, you couldn't possibly, possibly think
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.840]   of a company that had a poorer chance of surviving.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   It's a company with a new name, an industry that is back on its heels, and its predecessor,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   Wellington Management Company, was among the leaders in companies that were back on their
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   heels.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:43.520]   Redemption's pouring into the industry, more to us, market share plummeting, we were obliged
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.800]   to keep the same managers that ruined the funds in the first place, under the deal with
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.200]   the directors that led us to form Vanguard.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:59.000]   And the outlook is grim, mutual funds, the industry dropped its assets by a third, we
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.240]   dropped by even more than the previous company.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.480]   And then you got a new idea, it's called the Index Fund, never tried it before.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.040]   What chance does a company like that, with its new structure, we call it the Vanguard
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.800]   Experiment, no one ever run a mutual fund that was mutual before.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.220]   So what are the chances that company will succeed?
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.740]   I don't know, I'd say one in a thousand.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.560]   If you pushed me into a corner, I'd say one in a million.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:31.400]   But here we are today, well, I'll get to the size of the industry now, but I've done my
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:38.420]   best all this period, I say in my note here, did my best to build a better industry, but
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:45.720]   I think a better phrase was, I did my best to disrupt an industry that was sadly in need
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.960]   of disruption, and that is happening, as you'll see from these slides.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:18:00.800]   When I preach about my convictions, the preacher, Ecclesiastes, it all begins with, and I love
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:09.140]   this quote from the musical Hamilton, I don't know if any of you have seen it, we have seen
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.740]   it, Lynn Miranda was actually in it, we felt very happy about that, but with the introducers
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:22.980]   you can see this on the video, you can go to one of the video sources and find it very
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.920]   easily, Lynn Miranda, Hamilton, White House, just put that in and you'll see it.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.900]   And he says in this thing, talking about Hamilton, all in the strength of his writing, he embodies
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.220]   the words, ability to make a difference, and I've done my best to emulate that.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.900]   I am no Hamilton, no question about that, but I've tried to emulate that all through
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:50.980]   my career, and I'll get to the preaching in a minute, but we've started to get much more
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.380]   recognition for how much our structure and our strategy, mutual structure and the index
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:03.900]   strategy has saved our investors, and Bloomberg came out with an article, it puts that number
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.140]   at $1 trillion.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:12.380]   Now it should have said "is saving" rather than "has saved" because they looked ahead
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:19.100]   for five years as well, and it should have also said they were wrong there, and if you
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:27.140]   do the math using their formula, it's actually $2 trillion.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:36.300]   And here's the data, and the first three boxes are just what they do.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:45.780]   They talk about lower expense ratios, lower trading costs, the effect on our competitors.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:51.620]   Where are we here, $200 billion, and the future savings we'll get doing that, I'm projecting
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.380]   over the next years, the original savings come right out of the Vanguard calculation,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:05.700]   which is what our principal competitors charge minus what we charge, and multiply that number,
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:12.140]   expense ratio number, it's probably about 70 basis points or something, 60, times a
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:19.340]   trillion dollars, and you're talking real money, and so it's right there, and it's made
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:27.780]   us into the nation's second most important company, according to Fortune, and there they
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.780]   are.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:36.380]   They said, Fortune said, it was a tie with Fidelity.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.980]   Are you kidding?
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:47.020]   I mean, Fidelity is yesterday, pal, and as I said in that Wall Street Journal story,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:52.860]   which I probably should not have said, they'll probably sell the company within the next
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.860]   five years.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.620]   You know, I don't think that was a smart thing to say, but I believed it, and so we're tied
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:05.020]   with Fidelity, they say, even though they're limping badly, and I feel kind of badly.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:12.020]   They just built a company on flashy performance, and then it was over, and they've struggled
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:19.020]   to keep up all the time, and they fail, and I don't wish them ill, I wish them well.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.260]   My good wishes don't seem to have, they seem to have fallen on deaf ears up there, but
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:30.820]   I do wish them well, and you're probably saying, who's the most, this is the most important
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:36.860]   private companies, which has something to do with, well, Fortune doesn't quite say it,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:43.980]   the most valuable private companies, and it's quite remarkable, because people have forgotten
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:50.380]   that we have shareholders, and they have a value, and the Johnson money goes to the Johnson
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.140]   family, and our value goes to our shareholders, and I don't think anyone's ever looked at
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.260]   it that way before, so after telling the Wall Street Journal that I appreciate their recognition
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:06.660]   that we are a private company, it does have a value, very rare, I then take on, I explain
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.220]   to them, ask them to please explain to me how they got Fidelity in a tie with us, of
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:17.780]   course I haven't heard back from them, but it was only six months ago, so we'll be patient.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.020]   Now you're wondering, who's the most valuable company?
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.060]   Any guess out there?
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:35.540]   Uber, Uber, Uber, I love to say that, are they coming now Mike, they have all this communication,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:42.380]   there are probably three of them waiting out in front, but a lot of that value has been
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:50.460]   created by I think communication, that's the Hamilton part, and I do a lot of papers, journal
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:57.620]   papers, which I'm very proud of, 25 in all in these two magazines, 15 in the Journal
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:05.060]   of Portfolio Management, and that bottom one, David and Goliath, is a speech I gave in May,
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.940]   and one of my better ones, if I do say so, we will provide copies to all those who would
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.660]   like to see them, and they're right there on my website, and Financial Analyst Journal
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.340]   happened to want an article, I can't remember whether they asked me for the article, no
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.300]   I think I did it, and sometimes they ask for one, and sometimes I just say here it is,
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:32.760]   and they print them, I think, a little casually, but that's their problem, and so I think acceptance
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.220]   in the academic community is a very, you don't think much about it, and you don't hear much
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:45.300]   about it, but it's a very important part of Vanguard's standing in the world's eye, standing
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:51.120]   up to the academic challenge, and we do that well, and I will say quickly that in that
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.820]   David and Goliath speech, I took a shot at Professor Andrew Lowe, who is the king of
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   the academic finance guys, a professor of MIT, and he had written some stuff, so I just
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.260]   took issue with, and I sent a copy of the speech, I didn't want to do it on his back,
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.820]   he was late getting to the point of the Q group meeting where I spoke, and he didn't
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:19.660]   get out until the next day, and he sent me this lovely letter, two page letter, thanking
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.740]   me for being so gracious about my dissent, he thought I made a lot of good points, and
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:38.380]   I should know that the Lowe family has lots of money invested in Vanguard funds, go figure,
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:47.300]   so the books of course are another huge communication thing, and it's amazing to me, that little
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   book of common sense investing, and when Wiley told me they wanted me to do it, I said you
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.900]   know I don't really want to do it, there's a lot of ego here, but I'm the only one
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.300]   that can write the kind of book that investors want to have, so I wrote it in a much more
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:07.180]   simple way, much shorter way, shorter words, shorter paragraphs, and it's been the number
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:14.620]   one bestseller for almost nine years now, for more than nine years, and 216,000 copies,
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:20.140]   typical investment book sells 3,000 copies, and the reviews are fantastic, and they get
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:28.460]   better, the 2016 reviews, 72 on that note here, are the highest, much higher, say the
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:34.420]   first two reviews I got, not a lot higher, but higher, so it's very gratifying, and
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.260]   we'll probably go ahead and do another copy of that book on its 10th anniversary, or maybe
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:44.180]   11th, I'm so damn busy, but it's just short, it's simple, it's persuasive, and it's
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:51.780]   not all of the book thing, it's, here's just how book sales are in the last few years,
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:59.740]   80,000 copies, and amazingly, Common Sense on Mutual Funds, a complex book, and it came
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.460]   out in a 10th anniversary edition, and it really helped that David Swenson, the genius,
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.580]   I think he's a genius, and he's certainly a hell of a nice guy, who runs the Yale Endowment,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:14.420]   most successful endowment in America, and I wrote a foreword to it, so I've got Swenson
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:21.660]   on my side, and I've got Buffett on my side, but I've got Bill Bernstein on my side,
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:31.540]   and Peter Bernstein, and God knows who else, Andy Lowe, I suppose, who can be against this?
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.780]   So all my books together come out to about 895,000 copies, and I suppose if I could live
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:48.620]   to about 130, which seems unlikely, we would cross the million book sales mark.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:58.060]   But I'm not the world's greatest writer, but I know how to write, and I know how to write
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.240]   expository prose, it's a lot easier to do what I do than write a novel or something
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.460]   like that, which I have no intention of trying, because I'd be totally incompetent, but I
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.540]   really am proud to have those books, and sort of a monument to be around for a long, long
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   time.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.940]   You'll notice at the bottom there is a book called Enough, and I want to say just a word
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.260]   about that, not yet.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:30.080]   I showed you this slide last year, and it has a rival.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.820]   Somebody else is trying to grab my territory, and a year ago, when I showed you this slide,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.420]   you all laughed.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.020]   You laughed.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:55.140]   You're not laughing now, slide.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.420]   I've had so damn much fun in this life, it shouldn't be allowed.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.940]   So let's take a look at Vanguard, Vanguard's growth, and I think at the end of this section,
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:13.220]   we'll take a little break for you and me, and show you about 15 minutes of video.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:20.460]   Mike Nolan put it together, he was still working on it this morning, he's a worker, that guy,
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.460]   and so we're going to show you that.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.140]   We'll have a little break, but I'll do this one first.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:30.060]   And let me say, the Lord did not put me on this earth to run a three and a half trillion
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.540]   dollar company.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.720]   I had many more questions about size than I had no interest in bragging about size.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:43.220]   It's a greater responsibility, and for me, a constant worry.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.740]   And when I say constant, where was it that I first started to really speak out about
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.860]   the problems Vanguard might face when it grew?
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:05.340]   Well, I gave a lecture to the crew, and it talked about growth, and the value of growth,
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:10.860]   and that we better be careful, lest we look like some giant insurance company, mutual
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.820]   insurance company, where nobody cares about anybody, nobody knows anybody, and everybody
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:22.300]   does what they're told, comes in at nine, leaves at five every day, and that's it.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.860]   That's not the kind of company I wanted to have.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:31.460]   I wanted the crew to be involved, not automatons, and yet even when I gave this talk, I was
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.940]   worried about what comes with growth, is, well, you'll hear it right now in this quote
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:45.740]   from the speech, and that is, "For God's sake, let's always keep Vanguard a place where judgment
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.740]   has a fighting chance to triumph over process."
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:57.420]   Well, believe me, process grows as a percentage of what you do, and judgment shrinks.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.600]   The bigger you get, it's not anybody's fault.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.940]   You can do things to hold the tide back, but it's, you know, you can do a little bit better
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.520]   than King Midas did, but it gets harder and harder as you grow.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.540]   So when was that, when did I worry about that?
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.400]   1997.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.140]   What were Vanguard's assets in 1997?
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:23.460]   This is in one of my speeches and character counts, $47 billion.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.300]   So if I'd said $3.5 trillion in that speech, everybody would have thought I had maybe one
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:35.740]   martini too many, but I've always been worried about it, and I think President Manning doing
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:42.660]   as good a job as can be done in trying to keep the place human, keep small groups together,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.420]   try and have a bunch of small little companies in this large corporation, and we're not really
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:53.940]   huge, 15,000, I guess it is 16,000, I think they say, crew members all over the world,
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:31:03.740]   and it does get harder, and you work at it, and so, and I work at it.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:09.980]   I should tell you that I spend a lot of time, probably at least, say, 25%, Michael, maybe,
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.020]   25% of my time working with the crew, one-on-one, I meet an hour with each work for excellence
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:22.060]   winner, they bring team meetings into my office, I do 25th anniversaries, 30th anniversaries,
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:27.460]   retirements, and it gives me a chance to appear before them, my fellow crew members, and let
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.500]   them know that there's a living human being still hanging on, trying to keep this place
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.300]   personal, warm, and friendly.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.700]   It's not easy, but we do it.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:46.300]   So the domination of Vanguard begins with the, really, the first, the huge impact of
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:52.180]   indexing that we have, and we have dominated industry cash flow, and industry took in the
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:32:03.180]   last year, 12 months, $178 billion, of which $269 billion was Vanguard.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:10.260]   So all of our other competitors put together had $91 billion going out, and we had $269
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.260]   billion.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.740]   And the cash flow keeps growing, as you'll see in this next chart, and you can see it's
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:25.180]   driven by, look at that blue part of the stack, it's clearly driven by stock-and-bond funds,
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:30.220]   index stock-and-bond funds, and the money market funds, were actually quite dominant
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.460]   in '98 and '99, '98.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:38.580]   You can't see it here, they're certainly our biggest sector, and they've kind of vanished
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.780]   from the scene, and now are leaking quite badly within their federal regulations.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.220]   So I was really amused by this.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.260]   You've heard the expression, "Our growth is off the charts."
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:57.380]   Well, in fact, our growth is off the charts, and therefore, when Morningstar put this report
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.500]   out, my headline is "Where's Vanguard?" taken after "Where's Waldo?"
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.100]   You'll see the underline, "Vanguard is not displayed in Exhibit 6," because it would
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.300]   dwarf all the other data points and decrease the chart's legibility.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:20.000]   Now, that isn't the ultimate accolade, but I roughed this out, and I think the Vanguard
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.780]   stack on this would be maybe 9 inches tall, just to put it in perspective, so you can
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.940]   imagine how all these would have to shrink to get us on the page.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:39.340]   So the rise of Vanguard has been incredible, $3.5 trillion, you can see we've gone from
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:47.900]   way behind Fidelity, minus $204 billion at the beginning in 2000, and when you go from
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:58.900]   $204 billion behind a competitor to $1.8 trillion ahead of them, that's quite a shift in leadership.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.540]   So the market share grows, and you can see we went through hard times after we started
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.540]   the firm.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.620]   I referred to them.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.140]   Market share dropped by pretty close to a third, and then it started going, it's been
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.340]   going ever since, just by staying the course, giving us that momentum.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:20.540]   To a dominance that's totally without precedent in terms of its industry leadership.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:25.260]   For those of you who are interested in knowing who the previous industry leaders were, Mass
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:32.080]   Financial Services was a leader for 17 years, and it got all the way up to a 15% market
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   share.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.640]   Ended in 1952.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.780]   Investors Diversified Services, now called Columbia, called American Express went away,
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.140]   they've had more name changes than you can imagine, and more discontinuities.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:49.980]   They have a huge direct selling organization, they've had that kind of an organization since
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   1904.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.740]   They weren't selling mutual funds then, they were selling base amount certificates, which
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.900]   were kind of a rip-off.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:03.780]   And they held the industry leadership for 29 years, no stopping them when you've got
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.780]   all your own controlled sales force, the rest of us were working through brokers, by and
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.780]   large.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:15.460]   Columbia Fidelity gets to 13.8%, takes 15 years, we've held that leadership for 15 years
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:22.860]   up to 13.8%, and then starts to drift below by the time you get to 2003.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.700]   And then Vanguard, and we've been up there 12 years now, the largest firm in the industry.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:34.740]   And our peak market share, look at that, almost 23% when the previous high was less than 16,
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.660]   uniformly less than 16.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.020]   So we've disrupted the industry, I think it's fair.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.340]   And it's all based on index funds, almost all.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:50.780]   And you can see the index share of our business in this chart, it's gone from zero in 1975
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:58.260]   to 37% of our total of industry assets, I should say.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:06.220]   And gradually, zero, four, 16, 37, and three firms dominate that cash flow.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.540]   And that's what's made the difference in growth.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.940]   We have Vanguard with 70% of its growth, 70% of its assets in index fund.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.100]   Fidelity with only 14, they don't really have their heart in it.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:24.660]   As I've said to people, if you're a missionary, have missionary zeal with this once untested
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:30.780]   idea, is it at least possible you will do better than someone who is dragged into that
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.820]   arena kicking and screaming and hating every minute of it?
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.580]   You know who to bet on.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.580]   And you'll be right.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:42.160]   They're only 14%, but they're our biggest competitor in indexing, in the traditional
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.060]   index fund field.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.620]   BlackRock 68%, that's basically an index fund, started with ETS.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.660]   That's just what they do.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.340]   American Funds has this professional aura about them, and they're not going to cross
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.340]   that line yet.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:04.860]   And State Street, of course, is a rapid turnover ETF business.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:13.580]   And every year, State Street, every day, I should say, that State Street index fund,
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:19.380]   Standard & Poor's, SPDR, is the most widely traded stock in the world, the most widely
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.420]   traded stock in the world in terms of dollar volume.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.180]   I think that's an uninteresting business.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.140]   Trading is a losing game, finally.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:33.580]   The big shareholders in all these ETFs, the big ETS, our exchange-traded funds, our banks
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.620]   and other financial institutions are trading with one another.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:40.540]   And I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I know that both sides do not win.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.540]   Am I doing OK?
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.660]   So that's been a huge portion of what we do.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:54.780]   I think we'll pause and give you a little relief, and I'll have some coffee, and Mike
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:00.260]   will turn on the video.
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:11.020]   Well, we actually got quite a number of questions about whether the popularity of index funds,
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.740]   you know, they're pretty ubiquitous at this point, actually might be problematic, or whether
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.100]   index funds work in this more volatile market environment.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.980]   So how would you respond to that?
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:26.940]   Well, indexing, take the market environment, the easy one first, indexing works in all
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.940]   environments.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.140]   You just have to understand one simple thing.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.900]   All of us investors own all the stocks in the stock market.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:39.940]   And so those that are indexed own them in their proper proportion of market value, capitalization
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:45.940]   weight, where things like Google and Alphabet, as it's now called, are the largest.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.740]   And everybody owns two-thirds of that, everybody but the indexers, roughly.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.500]   And the index owns one-third.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.380]   So it's volatile for us, the index fund, it's volatile for the investors.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.420]   They're all one, because investors own the market.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.800]   And they can either do it the intelligent way, own an index fund that holds it, or trade
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.460]   with one another.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.460]   And one trader trades with another trader.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.100]   It must be obvious there can be no value added there, just who owns the stock.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.460]   Ah, but there is something nice going on here for Wall Street.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:26.300]   The man in the middle, the broker in the casino, the guy with the rake, takes his share out.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:32.100]   So the other investors, the non-index investors, are playing a loser's game.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.540]   And people have figured that out.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:40.100]   And I get letters pretty close to every day, Rebecca, saying, I wish I'd read your first
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.100]   book earlier.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.180]   That's now 20 years old, 25 years old, I guess, almost.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.420]   And I wish I'd listened to your ideas earlier.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:40:05.660]   Or I did, and I'm now retired.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:11.180]   Our next question, shifting gears from retirement, is from Chris in San Jose, California, who
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.900]   says, "Congratulations, Mr. Bogle.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.300]   May you live longer and provide sensible financial guidance to us all.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.540]   I have two sons, ages 23 and 20.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.660]   So what is the one single piece of advice you'd give them so that they are financially
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.100]   secure when they retire?"
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.340]   So what's the one thing investors just getting started, right out of college, really should
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.020]   know?
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.700]   Start to invest now.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.020]   Continue to invest as you have the money.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.780]   Increase your investments as you make more money.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:47.460]   Have a little note in your budget so that, let's say, 15% of your compensation goes into
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.460]   a mutual fund investment, a low-cost mutual fund investment, or even better, an index
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.500]   fund investment.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.940]   And that's only because I believe in it.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.940]   I'm not trying to sell anything.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:56.940]   Well, that's okay.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.940]   You can sell.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.940]   It's a Vanguard webcast.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:05.180]   But make sure that your contributions go up with your income.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:12.100]   And then, you know, I would say another rule that I use, it's a little overdone maybe,
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.460]   don't peak, P-E-E-K.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.820]   Don't look at your account every day.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.080]   Don't look at your account every month.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.620]   I tell people that if they don't look at it, they start investing when they're 22 years
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:34.380]   old and they don't peak at their 401(k) statement or IRA statement until they retire, a caution.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.260]   Have a good cardiologist next to you because when you open that final statement, you're
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.880]   allowed to open it at the end, you will probably have a heart attack.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.260]   You won't believe how much money you've accumulated.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:51.780]   It's so remarkable what long-term compounding plus, well, the magic of long-term compounding
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:42:02.100]   returns without the tyranny of compounding costs is magical mathematics.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:08.540]   And if you're aware of that, that's really all you need to know.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.420]   Start early, save often, and don't look.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.420]   Yep.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.420]   Sounds good.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:27.540]   All right, let's take another live question.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.380]   This is a good one and certainly a lot of sentiment around this.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.300]   This is from Loretta and she says, "Everyone is saying that the markets are currently in
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.180]   a state we've never seen before.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:42.740]   Do you think we can still rely on the historical principles we have always relied on today?
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.820]   Is it different this time?"
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:53.820]   This time is not different, but stock valuations are higher than they've been and the prospects
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.620]   for the future are lower than they have been in a long, long time.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.380]   You know, in the period I've been in this business, the stock market has averaged a
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.540]   return of about 12 percent a year.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:10.340]   And that's just not going to happen again, because at that time, during that period,
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.460]   the dividend yield, and a very important component of stocks, stock returns, was about almost
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.460]   6 percent.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.460]   Call it 5.5.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.460]   Now it's 2.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.820]   That's a deadweight loss.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.400]   The average earnings growth was pretty close to 6 percent.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.700]   I don't see that earnings growth happening in the future.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.740]   I think it'll be, if we're lucky, 4 percent.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.740]   And stocks have high valuations.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.980]   The price earnings multiple, the essential nature, the essential measure of value, is
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.580]   around 22 times earnings, and the norm is about 16.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:44.420]   So putting those three things together, they're all dear, expensive, if you will.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.620]   And so we can look for maybe stock returns on a balanced basis.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:53.980]   And interest rates are 5.5 percent during that long period of my time in this business,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:44:01.500]   and now they're 2 percent, actually 1.6 percent on the 10-year intermediate term treasury.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.980]   And so bond returns will be lower.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.760]   So I think that we'll be lucky to get a return of 4 or 5 percent from a balanced portfolio
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   in the next decade.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.460]   I don't look at this, and I don't want the viewers to look at it, as saying he's predicting
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.860]   something for the year.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.620]   I have never predicted anything for the year.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.140]   I don't believe in year-long.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.540]   Too many things can go wrong.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:25.980]   But in the long run, and this gets to the heart of that question, the same reason for
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.700]   generating returns, the reason for generating, that stocks generate returns, is the same
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.940]   as it has always been, the earning power of corporations.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.400]   They make earnings.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.300]   They pay some out in dividends.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:44.060]   They reinvest to build newer, faster, innovate, whatever they do.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.820]   And that's where earnings growth comes from, from that reinvestment, by and large.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.260]   So dividend yields are lower, and the reinvestment will be lower.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.400]   And so the returns will be lower.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.500]   I think that's almost certain.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:03.540]   And so just relax, because the one thing that will guarantee your retirement plan will have
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:08.580]   an asset value of zero is don't invest at all.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.580]   True.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.580]   Actually, you should save more.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.580]   Yep.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:17.500]   And what's hard, and I think very important for the audience to understand, is you have
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.020]   to accept the market returns for what they are going to be.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:22.340]   Don't reach beyond them.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.060]   Don't do something speculative.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.280]   Don't lever up to make up the difference.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.940]   It just is highly unlikely to pay-- well, it certainly will not work for everybody,
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.580]   and highly, highly unlikely to work for very many people.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:50.740]   So, Mr. Bogle, we have actually gone over time.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.740]   Obviously, thousands of questions and tweets left.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.900]   Maybe we can get you to answer a few tweets after the end of the broadcast.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.860]   But I did want to give you the opportunity to have some final thoughts, and you can share
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.540]   them right with the shareholders that are watching, if you'd like.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:03.540]   Sure.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:09.740]   Well, I think I've had a great time in this business, almost unimaginably great.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:13.220]   I've accomplished something that has not been done before.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:18.020]   The idea of index fund investing is kind of taking over the world, and it is taking over
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.020]   the world.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.020]   And it's going to continue, by the way.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.180]   I warn my actively-managed competitors, they're going to have to do something somewhere to
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   protect themselves.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:32.100]   But the whole core of everything we do here, most notably and easily measurable in indexing,
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:39.220]   is putting the client first and giving you your fair share of whatever market returns
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.020]   develop.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:46.460]   They may be good, and they may be bad, and I warn you that owning an index fund is not
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.300]   a free ride to prosperity under all circumstances.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.440]   When the markets are bad, and they will be bad from time to time, particularly in the
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.500]   short run, the index fund will give you your fair share of those bad returns.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.620]   So don't think of it as a miracle.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:07.180]   Think about it as an intelligent policy that puts you in the focus of the system.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:12.220]   And fortunately, again, Vanguard's structure, we're able to deliver on that promise, a mutual
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:17.500]   company in which the shareholder comes first, last, and always.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.660]   Or as I would put it in a more simple way, you'll recognize the cadence, Vanguard is
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:28.300]   a company of the investor, by the investor, and for the investor.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.900]   And you all are those investors.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.060]   And I thank you deeply for your kind comments about me, and I thank you for your confidence
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:47.700]   in me and in Vanguard.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:54.740]   I should say that that last little segment was totally un-tipped off to me, and I was
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:59.340]   going to get that question at the end, totally unscripted and totally unrehearsed, and I
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:03.780]   think it's better than what I do when I'm totally scripted and totally rehearsed.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:10.100]   Joining us now to discuss the future of indexing and what lies ahead for active management
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.460]   is the one and only Jack Vogel.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.660]   He joins us from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.340]   Jack, great to see you.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.260]   Thanks so much for joining us.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.060]   The numbers here, when it comes to passive investments, are staggering.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:27.900]   Since 2008, active funds have seen $600 billion in outflows.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.540]   $261 billion, meantime, have moved into index funds.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:35.140]   Bill Ackman recently referred to an index bubble.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.820]   What part of the rise of indexing has caught you by surprise?
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:44.860]   Well, I guess it's strength, although I'm disappointed by how long it took.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.780]   You know, 40 years is a long time, and it actually took until the mid-90s.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:54.900]   We started the fund in 1975, and it took until the mid-90s before indexing caught on.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:00.180]   Then it caught on with a real flourish, and now totally dominates the industry.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:07.420]   In an industry in need of some creative destruction, we're destroying a lot of old tenants, old
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:13.560]   ideas, and making life difficult a little bit for active money managers with high costs.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.980]   Active money managers with low costs are doing a little bit better than that.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:23.340]   There's been a bit of criticism brewing, I'm sure in part because of that success, Jack.
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:28.060]   In fact, recently an analyst at Sanford Bernstein wrote a note saying that index investing is
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.660]   worse than Marxism.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:37.540]   I'm sure you've seen, I'm sure you've heard these kinds of criticisms before because,
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:42.060]   you know, index investing doesn't participate in the price-setting mechanism.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.980]   How do you feel about that accusation, though?
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.140]   Well, I don't know that I can find the right words.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:57.060]   "Idiotic" would be one, and "totally wrong-headed" would be another, a silly attempt to get across
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:01.460]   an argument that is terribly flawed.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:08.820]   The article, the Marxist article, if you will, says that any field of endeavor that subtracts
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.540]   value from society is doomed to fail.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:16.500]   Well, index funds, indexing in general, particularly in the mutual fund industry, is adding huge
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:23.060]   amounts of value to our society, to investors, so if they don't understand that, I'm not
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.420]   sure what they do understand.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:32.340]   And it's a funny article, it's long, detailed, I'm not sure how many of the readers can get
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:38.140]   through all those, or can understand all those formulas that are printed page after page,
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:44.300]   and the comparison with the financial business to the mining industry struck me as absurd
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.300]   until I realized they were both extractive industries.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:54.100]   The mining industry is taking gold and coal out of the ground, and the financial industry
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:58.900]   is extracting value from the clients it serves.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:04.220]   At what point does indexing make the market much less efficient?
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:09.340]   And the reality is that you could get to, right now, indexing is around 30% of the total
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   market.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:16.180]   I'm sure you can get to 50 or 60% before anything would even be noticed, because the indexes
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.260]   just remove a certain portion of the market from trading activity.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:27.220]   And if it got to 90 or 95%, it would be, it might, at least, make it easier for active
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.420]   managers to win, or so it is alleged.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:36.060]   What the people that say that don't get is when the market is less efficient, it's easier
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:40.420]   for the good guys to win, and it's easier for the bad guys to lose.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.380]   They have to balance each other out.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.060]   There's just no way around that.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.100]   So I just fall back on the simple mathematics.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.020]   I don't worry about it.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:55.460]   It doesn't seem to have any dire effects so far, and the reality is that year after year,
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:52:01.860]   in terms of performance and investment returns, indexing outpaces active managers.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:08.060]   And this year, it's like 8% for the S&P 500, 6% for the average large-cap growth fund.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.580]   That's a huge, it's a 33% margin, 6 over, compared to 8.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.220]   And the reason it's not mysterious, it has nothing to do with being smart or dumb, it
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:20.500]   has to do with taking costs out of the equation.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.700]   And those costs are fund expense ratios, and those costs are fund turnover, and the fund
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:29.700]   industry turns over its portfolios a lot, and when you don't know how much that is,
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.500]   you know it's large.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.540]   And if you take those two numbers together, you're going to pick up about 2%, or 2% on
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:42.140]   a properly constructed comparison, should be the margin by which an S&P 500 fund beats
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.860]   the average large-cap fund.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.460]   It's as simple as that.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.540]   And I'm glad Jack mentioned costs, because fees, of course, for active funds were $0.99
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   in 2000.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.520]   They've since dropped to $0.77 today.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.060]   That's really the Vanguard effect at work.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.060]   Great.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:01.060]   And Eric Balchunis wrote a story about the Vanguard effect just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:07.020]   and Jack, he estimates that you and Vanguard have saved investors about a trillion dollars
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.300]   over the last four decades.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.940]   Do you reckon that's a fair calculation?
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:19.380]   Actually, I think it may even be, believe it or not, understated, because they compare
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:25.060]   our expense ratios with the average of our competitors, and the fact that we aren't trading,
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:30.500]   which is a huge cost saving, but they don't take those savings each year and earn a return
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.660]   on the accumulated savings, in other words, the cost of capital kind of an argument.
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:40.100]   So if you put some kind of a return on the money that we save investors each year, and
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:45.500]   look at it over 20 years or so, you find a huge and staggering number, whether a trillion
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.860]   is the right number or a trillion and a half, I wouldn't know.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.540]   But it's big, very big, and it's good for the investor.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.100]   That's the important thing.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:59.140]   Okay, I'm buying it.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.180]   I believe!
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:17.500]   You know, these things are, I've been accused of, even in my books, of just selling my own
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:24.740]   ideas to help Vanguard, and that really has nothing to do with my motivation.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.340]   We don't need any more money coming in.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.860]   We don't need any more sales.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.340]   We're happy to have what we have.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:36.820]   I'm doing this because I am passionate about it, and it's true, and it works.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.740]   So what the heck are you supposed to say?
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:44.620]   You know, I can't say, well, you know, investment management and active management will win.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.860]   A few will win here and there.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.660]   I'll talk about that later.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.660]   And they're never seen again.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:54.100]   I mean, think about something like Magellan with a $120 billion fund, and now I think
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.020]   it's eight.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.580]   That's a lot of disappointment.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:04.540]   Actually, if I was better, I could tell you it was $112 billion worth of disappointment.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.700]   But in any event, we'll now turn to part three of the changes in the fund industry, and I'm
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:15.380]   going to go pretty quickly here, because I don't want to run, when's my time up?
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.540]   Oh, I've got until 9.25.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:22.500]   I might even be able to finish this, but maybe I can get an extra couple of minutes.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:29.340]   So what's happened to this industry since I joined it all those years ago?
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:33.060]   Here I am in my 60th anniversary.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.100]   Industry leadership.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:40.060]   The industry has grown, number one, and it's grown in a very different way from domination
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:45.340]   by money market funds, which was about half of the industry at one point here, and then
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:50.020]   all of a sudden, the long-term index funds, you can see that green line, and it's only
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:58.140]   a matter of time since the index funds will be, well, those are all equity funds there,
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:04.460]   37% equity fund assets are indexing, and back in the day, there was not even an index fund.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:08.820]   So we have today $3.1 trillion.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:18.660]   We use different numbers on these, 78% equity and 22% balance, so balance and bond, I guess
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:25.140]   that is, and so we're growing at 14%, and that doesn't seem to show that, but the industry
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.140]   has changed.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.740]   Think about changing leadership.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:31.660]   MIT, now MFS, has dropped out of the top 10.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:36.340]   They still make a lot of money for their parent companies, Sun Life of Canada, and they don't
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.340]   do so well for their shareholders.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.620]   Vanguard has gone from Wellington Fund number six to number one.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:47.180]   Fidelity wasn't even on the chart in 1951, although we sort of knew they were a competitor
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.660]   to number two.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.100]   BlackRock didn't even exist back then.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.340]   The American funds did exist, although they were too small to be here.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.860]   They were probably $3 million back in 1951, something like that.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:04.820]   The numbers are really remarkable, and State Street knew, J.P. Morgan knew, On the Bandwagon,
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:10.300]   Tin Cone knew, Dimensional Fund Advisors, a very strong competitor, probably one of
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:16.060]   our two strongest competitors, actually, and so the industry is less dominated by these
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.060]   10 leaders.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:24.500]   They used to be 72% of the total, and now they're 60%, but the change in leadership
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:29.620]   is quite striking in the new leaders that come along, including Vanguard.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:35.700]   In this huge growth, expense ratios haven't gone down, which you would think they would
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:41.660]   go down, with the economies of scale that are available and rife in this industry, but
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:48.380]   the problem is that the investment managers and their parents, the companies that own
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:53.420]   them, most of them are owned by conglomerates or by the public, have taken all the economies
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.100]   of scale and aggregated them to their own benefit rather than the benefit of shareholders.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.980]   So you can see, I mean, nobody would believe this, but if you look at just the straight
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:10.660]   average of the expense ratios of the funds in '51, .62, it's gone up 72%, even though
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:16.860]   the industry has gone up, or this part of the industry has gone up from 1 billion of
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:27.300]   assets to 4 trillion of assets, and their expenses have gone up almost the same amount.
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:33.820]   So the new model, Vanguard, has assets of 3.5 trillion, a slightly different number,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.540]   and expenses are 4 billion.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:41.860]   So the privatization of the industry, indicated by these firms that are in red, has been directed
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.780]   to the financial conglomerates that own all these firms.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:49.140]   It's pretty disgraceful, because they're in business to make money for themselves and
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.140]   not for the fund shareholders.
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.620]   Not that they don't want to make money for shareholders, of course they do, but they
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.860]   don't want to do it at their own expense.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.260]   So this terrible flaw that's brought about this public ownership that you can see there,
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:07.300]   private ownership, conglomerate ownership, in red, goes back to 1958.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:09.020]   Very few people know this.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:15.580]   The Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court, determined not to review a decision by the
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:21.020]   California Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed a California company, a very
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:29.140]   small one, to sell its trusteeship at a capitalized value of trusteeship, and that shouldn't have
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.140]   happened.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:36.100]   It was a bad decision, the Supreme Court ratified it, and all of a sudden we have each mutual
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.460]   fund, except for one, you know what that one is, has two masters.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:46.460]   And as Luke will tell us, "No man can serve two masters, for either they hate the one
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:51.100]   and love the other, or hold to the one and despise the other."
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:59.380]   And you know who gets the love and who gets held onto, and that's the management company,
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.580]   because the management company directors control both the fund board and the fund, as well
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.820]   as the management company.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:10.340]   Yet that's the industry's principal ownership structure, unlike what it was way back in
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.220]   1951.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:23.700]   And now we have publicly held companies 11, conglomerates 28, that's 39 companies, ten
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.420]   are privately owned and one mutual, and that includes the three largest firms in the industry,
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.580]   which has something to do with one of the largest firms in the industry.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.220]   They haven't let the conglomerate be first.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:39.540]   This is a bad change for the industry, and it's almost totally unrecognized.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.100]   When I talk to people in the industry, they never heard of the ISI decision, which is
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:48.500]   the name of the California case, but it's changed the character of the industry for
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.020]   the worse at the expense of shareholders.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.820]   And then we have, of course, the rise of the index fund.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:01:01.500]   I won't belabor this one, but since 19, well, if you go all the way back, the industry has
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:08.060]   grown at a very healthy 13% rate, traditional index funds, and we don't have any data for
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.060]   ETFs back there.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:14.700]   But if you look at the last seven years, actually, the traditional index funds are growing faster
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.140]   than the ETFs, and I think that's as it should be.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.620]   ETFs are heavily used as trading vehicles, and that's not the way to success in money
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.740]   management.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:28.540]   So I think we will see some kind of a shakeout, I'll talk about this at the end, and you really
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:34.500]   know all this, the difference between traditional index funds, TIFs, an acronym that has never
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:42.300]   been used by anybody but me, but I can still stick to it, so what, and ETS, you know, first
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:48.620]   index fund, set the principles, first index investment trust, own the whole market, diversify
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:54.460]   the nth degree, minimize transaction costs, tiny expense ratios, and bought to be held
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.020]   forever.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.900]   Exchange traded funds don't have those principles.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:05.260]   Pick your own index, there are only 1,900 indexes represented, so-called indexes, represented
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:11.140]   in these ETFs, diversify, but only within the sector you choose, could be very narrow,
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:16.820]   lower expenses, higher than the Vanguard prices mostly, but sometimes not particularly low,
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.520]   over 50 basis points.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.620]   And then there's the fringe, the lunatic fringe of ETS.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:27.460]   If you would like to bet on what the market is doing today, and decide in your wisdom
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:32.500]   whether it's going up or down, you can do so and get triple leverage on your bet, and
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:40.460]   I would call your broker, he's probably there by now, we'll do it at the first break, and
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.380]   tell me, William, whether you picked up or down.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.140]   What a way to run a business.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:52.900]   I mean, it's lunatic, but not all ETFs are the same, I think we're doing the best job
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.060]   of any of them.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:58.820]   I have my questions about ETFs, as everybody knows, and everybody laughs at me, you know,
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:07.060]   they are a very important marketing element, but our turnover, 200%, is far below, look
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:15.260]   at State Street, 2,200%, all the big guys have about a 900% turnover, and these little
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:23.380]   nuts have a turnover of 4,952%.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.100]   It just makes no sense at all.
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.920]   They're marketing gimmicks.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:35.540]   So it's the ETF that provides long-term consistency, maximum consistency for a long-term investor,
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.140]   and that's the secret.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:43.020]   So that's a change, and I hope people are using ETFs wisely, and I will tell you that
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.500]   there are plenty of perfect good uses for ETFs, just don't trade them.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:52.020]   Exchange-traded funds are fine, just so long as you don't trade them.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:58.340]   Now that isn't an oxymoronic statement, I don't know what is, but it is the traditional
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:04.420]   index fund that's had remarkable consistency, you see it in this chart, and we redid that
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:10.860]   chart I gave to the board back in 1975 to endeavor to persuade them that this was a
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:18.340]   good idea, and the index had beaten an essentially large-cap group of mutual funds, which is
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:23.580]   why the industry was almost entirely at 1.6 percentage points a year.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.260]   We redid that, and it's just an accident.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:32.860]   The market did almost the same in the second 30 years as the first 30 years, 11.3%, 11.2%.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:38.360]   It's just crazy that it's that close, but look at the difference, 1.6 percentage points
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.880]   in each period.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.980]   So we've now done this for 60 years, and if that's not persuasive, I don't know what to
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:52.140]   say, and the index is just the right way to go.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:57.180]   And you'll notice that we've shifted there, the average large-cap fund, because this industry
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:06.660]   is so diverse, that's the fair comparison, and you'll see that standard deviation, the
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:12.180]   index is just a hair more volatile, and look at the R-squared.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:19.620]   How much of the return of the average large-cap mutual fund is explained by the motion movement
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:29.200]   S&P 500%, 99% for the funds on average, and the index fund can only do 100%, having explained
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.500]   by the index.
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:37.340]   So it's a very fair comparison, and those numbers prove it, and prove the success.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.500]   So the question is, can you do better?
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.500]   Pick the right manager.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:48.500]   People say that beating the market, well this is a chart from Morningstar, Vanguard did
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.140]   some editing of it, but it's still correct.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:56.580]   This shows the number of, percentage of active funds in each category, outperforming their
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:04.420]   index benchmark, and you see you've got to get all the way over to small growth, really,
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:10.740]   some extent small blend at the bottom there, over at the right, to see that in general
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:18.380]   about 7% is the chances of winning the game, 11% overall if you count that big 30% at the
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.480]   end.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:25.540]   So people say, well I'll just pick, this is an interesting chart, I'll just pick the above
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:30.420]   average funds, as if the past tells you anything.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.500]   And here's how you would have done.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:39.940]   We gave you a similar chart to this last year, for the 5 years ending in 2014, this is ending
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:44.300]   in 2015, 5 year return, just look at this, it's amazing.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:49.740]   So you went to the highest best performing funds, in the highest quintile, highest 20%,
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:58.580]   and 16% of those funds, 16% of them, repeated, and you've been in the lowest performing group,
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.780]   24% of them repeated, your odds were better to pick the lowest performers than the highest
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.100]   performers.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.660]   And then look at down at number 5, the lowest, 15% of them moved to the highest quintile,
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:16.020]   9%, only 9% remained in the lowest quintile, and then look at the frightening thing over
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.620]   at the side.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:26.060]   Even if you pick a good fund, the odds are 25% would go out of business in 5 years.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.060]   Think about that.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.060]   It's amazing.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:32.940]   And you can see that the worse the performance has been, since the beginning of the period,
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:40.500]   and the greater the percentage gets folded up, 40% of the lowest quintile funds are merged
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.100]   or closed, and only 13% of the highest quintile.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.980]   That's very intuitive, not very hard to accept.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:53.180]   So we have not only index funds, but we have what I started talking about at the beginning
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.980]   of Vanguard, before we even had an index fund.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:01.380]   What we want to accomplish here is to give our funds relative predictability, relative
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:06.520]   to their market standard, market index they match, or their competitive group.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.300]   Relative predictability, because if you get very good, you're going to be very bad, and
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.580]   the money comes in when you're good, and bad when you go out.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.100]   So it's the right thing to do for investors, and it's the right strategy for the firm.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:21.940]   So relative predictability goes way beyond the index funds for Vanguard.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:30.260]   I'll show you some numbers on that, but 91% of our assets have very high relative predictability.
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:33.900]   They're average pre-cost returns, and they're superior post-cost returns.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:38.220]   You know, if you can be average, if we can be average, and are taking an expense ratio
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:43.940]   of 25 or something, 35 in our actively managed funds, and 5 in our index funds, you're going
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:48.820]   to beat everybody else who's charging 100 basis points, give or take, and has very high
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:52.260]   turnover costs, which the index fund lacks.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:09:00.400]   So I calculated 19% of our assets are in what I call virtual index funds, or relatively
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.300]   predictable mutual funds.
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.300]   And here's how they look.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.380]   I mean, it's kind of amazing.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.540]   Relative predictability is going to high R-squared, high amount of funds returned, the percentage
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.540]   of the fund returned.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.140]   It's explained by the action of the market.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.940]   And you can see the index funds, 199.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:25.380]   But the active funds, look at the active funds, Star, link 99, Correlation, Explorer 99, Wellington
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:37.020]   Fund, 98% of its return is explained by its index, which is 35% Corporate Bond Index,
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:40.380]   and 65% S&P 500, 98%.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.540]   It's managed to the tune of 2%.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.620]   Can't get very far out of line.
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:52.740]   And so on down, on average, taking all our equity funds, we have 96 correlation.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.980]   And even the industry is at 92.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.740]   These people are all basically selling the market, but they're charging you as if they're
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.900]   geniuses.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.340]   And that can't go on forever.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:06.900]   Now let's take a look at how funds do.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:13.940]   And you can see the relationship of cost in the far right column to the net positive score.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:19.500]   And you'll see how many funds each firm has, and we rank them, just add them up and divide
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.500]   them.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.500]   How many?
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.300]   One and two star, that's the lowest that Morningstar does, and four and five, that's the highest
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.300]   for Morningstar.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   Subtract and get the net.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.980]   It's not very complicated, but it's a good system because the Morningstar system itself
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   is good.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:40.500]   So you can see there's Vanguard at 0.18, 69%, two euro price in a virtual tie or in a tie.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.340]   Schwab is better than I would have expected, duh.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.340]   Dimensional Fund Advisor is very competitive.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.740]   TA Creft, competitive.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.220]   And then you get down to Fidelity, and they have a problem.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.340]   Not only high expenses, but it's money going in and out.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:03.500]   And they have 25% in the lowest performing group, compared to our 4%.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.140]   You win a lot in this world by not losing in the world of investing.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.220]   And they have 25% of their funds that have been losing.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.460]   Mainstreet Global, kind of normal, shouldn't waste much time on that.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.060]   Same for BlackRock.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:22.900]   Wisdom Tree, pretty disgraceful, 33% at the bottom, 36% at the top for a score of two.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:28.340]   But that's good compared to Goldman Sachs, look at them.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:39.900]   Look at them, 62% in the bottom group, 13% in the top group, net score minus 49 percentage
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.900]   points.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.940]   Mass Financial, minus 54.
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:49.940]   Franklin Templeton, 64, minus 70% at the bottom, 6% at the top.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:54.180]   No wonder there's kind of a shrinking ship, sinking ship.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:12:03.180]   And then you have the all-time champion, Putnam, struggling, minus 73%, 75% at the bottom,
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.860]   3% at the top.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.980]   I don't see how these people get dressed and come to work in the morning.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.820]   And honestly, it doesn't look like there's much point.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.460]   So the lower the cost, the higher the rankings.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.620]   Here's a rough correlation, won't spend much time on this.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:23.500]   It's a little crude correlation, but the correlation between average expense ratio on that chart
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.940]   and your rating is about 73%.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:31.820]   And so that's a good correlation, but not quite as good as, not quite as even.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.940]   There's a lot of variation around it.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.380]   Now, you saw American funds way at the bottom of that previous one.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.580]   I want to put that back a sec.
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.940]   You saw American funds at the bottom.
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:45.940]   And how could they be so bad?
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.220]   We have a lot of respect for them.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.220]   They're a good firm.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.820]   And the answer is that they don't just have the funds you read about in Investment Company
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.180]   of America, American Growth Fund, and Washington Mutual.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:02.220]   They have a whole bunch of series, all of which have high expense, many of which have
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.220]   high ratios.
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:05.060]   I can show you that right here.
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:10.340]   The funds that they track at Morningstar are Class A, and they leave out the sales charge
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.760]   at 575%.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:18.260]   And then they go to ones that replace that low, with a no-load basis, replace it with
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:26.060]   a high expense ratio, 134, 139, 140, 141.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.620]   So they have a much higher expense ratio.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:36.340]   They would produce a number of 4.58 for you, and we produce a number on this chart of 0.96%,
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.380]   almost twice as much.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:43.140]   So they're down there for a reason.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.660]   Another big competitor is the FAA, and I'm not going to – I'm going to save this
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.400]   chart, I think, for Bill and I to talk about it.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.020]   We're going to want to talk about Dimensional Fund Advisors when I talk about Bill becoming
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.020]   a major competitor.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.820]   Now, I want to talk about – briefly about Wellington Fund.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:08.420]   And I should tell you this, that when I finally got Vanguard formed, got the no-load, went
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:14.100]   no-load, got the index fund started, struggled with all those redemptions, tried to get the
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:21.060]   firm going in the right direction, and kept going in the wrong direction, by 1978, I decided
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:25.980]   to do what I thought was the highest duty of my career.
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:34.780]   Mr. Walter Morgan, the founder of Wellington Fund, loved the name Wellington, and was very
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.860]   close when he made me the head of the company at age 35.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:43.380]   Of course, I made mistakes, and some pretty serious, but without that dumb merger, there
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.840]   wouldn't be any Vanguards, and maybe all's well that ends well.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:54.980]   But I put my mind to Wellington Fund and redid the entire basis of – because now we're
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.180]   the client.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:00.620]   I couldn't tell Wellington what to do when I was running the management company, because
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.420]   all those geniuses were responsible for investment.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.420]   So-called geniuses.
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:11.700]   You'll see that record right there, in 1967, 1978, a collapse in Wellington Fund, and this
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:18.180]   is its relative returns, relative to the Average Balance Fund, and it took two years to get
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.180]   going.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.900]   We moved into a much more income-oriented, less growth-oriented base.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.420]   I even gave Wellington Management a portfolio to show them how to do it, if they couldn't
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.420]   figure it out.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.500]   It's not supposed to be my area of expertise, but it was fun to do.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.500]   And did it work?
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500]   Look at that.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.500]   Look at the renaissance.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:47.020]   It started in 1982 – in 1980, I should say, and it took a couple of years to go, to get
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.340]   done, to change in the portfolio.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.740]   But it's been almost entirely a straight line upward.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:59.420]   And if you look at that recent period, the Wellington Fund return has been 11.4%, compared
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.140]   to 8.9% for the Average Balance Fund.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.100]   That's 2.5% every year.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.100]   It's amazing, because our costs are so much lower.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:16.820]   Wellington Fund probably runs 30 basis points, 28, 17 basis points, and the competitors are
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:22.500]   charging about 117, and they're turning over, say, costing them 50 basis points a
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:23.500]   year.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:28.380]   So they're giving us, say, 1.5% at the beginning of each year, and they're very compatible.
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:33.060]   These probably 700 or 800 Balance Funds, the portfolios are all rather similar.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:39.100]   So we're going on the starting line, and some nice guy comes up to me and says, "Mr.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:44.580]   Wellington Fund, why don't you start this 100-yard dash on the 15-yard line?"
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:50.100]   "Well, I'll do that if that's what you want, and believe me, when you get a 15-yard
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:58.100]   head start in a 100-yard race, even I am not able to lose."
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.180]   And that whole age from the fund's beginning, you'll see it's quite varied, it's based
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.680]   on our cost advantage.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:10.640]   So I take this opportunity, and I should do this more often, trying not to forget, and
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.560]   I never do, the founder of Wellington Fund, and my mentor and my friend, and someone sent
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:25.620]   me a magazine article from 1990, when he was 92 years old, on the cover of a local magazine,
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.100]   and here is Walter Morgan, my great friend.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:35.760]   He was 92 years old then, if you can imagine that, 92, and he would live, his birthday
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:42.500]   was July 23rd, Hunter's birthday was July 23rd, 1998, and he died around September 5th,
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.500]   1998.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:50.000]   He used to say to me, "Jack, I don't know why the Lord would keep anybody around this
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.600]   long."
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   And I said, "Well, you know, I can give you an easy answer to that."
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:58.720]   I was forced to call him Walter, which was extremely difficult for me, and I said, "Walter,
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.440]   I know why the Lord keeps you around this long, because the Lord knows how much I need
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.240]   you."
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.240]   In that article, by the way, he's quoted as saying, "His best business decision was making
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.860]   me the head of the company."
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.980]   We had a couple of years to get used to that, it didn't work out very well in the beginning,
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.840]   but he was a wonderful, wonderful man, and so I said, "God bless you, Walter Morgan,
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.800]   my friend and my mentor."
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.580]   Never anybody quite like him, and never will be.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:32.280]   Looking ahead, I want to talk about future market returns briefly.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:41.240]   Have we done that, I don't know, I guess I can look, five minutes?
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.000]   Keep me honest, Mike, sorry.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Okay.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   Once invited, of course I will.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:04.600]   And if you read my technical stuff, they gave me this nice chair, you might as well sit
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   down.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.760]   It was an actual page that said something like, "Never stand up if you can sit down,
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.160]   and never sit down if you lie down."
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:20.000]   So I made my attempt at the ladder late in the afternoon yesterday, and I lie down on
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.840]   the office floor and take a nap.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:31.320]   And it used to be easy, but now I can't get up, I almost have to call for help.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.760]   You might as well laugh, crying doesn't do any good.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:42.360]   But the important point is, the returns come from what corporations give us.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.400]   And we call that investment return, that's the, if you know my stuff, that's the initial
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   dividend yield.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:52.240]   Very important when you buy in, the lower the yield, the better, the worse your future
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.360]   return, relative return will be, and the higher the yield, the better it will be.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.680]   And you just add that dividend, we do this I think on a rolling 10-year basis, and then
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.760]   you add subsequent earnings growth.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.880]   And we know the dividend yield, and we know within close ranges what the earnings growth
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.560]   will be under anything remotely resembling normal circumstances.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.760]   And the earnings growth, you know, it really can't be, well in the depression it was never
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.680]   below let me say 4%, and rarely above 10%.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.840]   So you've got a very narrow range to pick your numbers.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.640]   And you don't know the future, but you can just take the average for the recent period,
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.840]   and that's what we do.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.520]   But this is the real earnings growth plus dividend yield.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:40.160]   And that corporate return that you get through the stock market, the stock market's derivative
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:43.600]   of the value created by American business.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:49.120]   And speculative return is the other important element, but only for a short time.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.360]   And you can see those bumps along the bottom, change in the PE on each 10-year period, and
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.120]   how much it added or subtracted from total return.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.160]   You can see there's some tractions anywhere anytime it's below 1.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:07.680]   And so the annual return, basically speculative return in the long run is zero.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:16.240]   It happens to be 3/10 of 1% in this 19, sorry, 116-year period.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.280]   So you're relying on fundamentals matter.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.320]   And finally, valuations don't in the long run, but valuations are everything in the
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.560]   short run.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.560]   So that is background.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.320]   Oh, well, I'll give you this one more chart.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.800]   I fuss with this, you know, we know the return on the stock market, we know the return on
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:39.840]   the fundamentals, and so we just do that in 10-year moving averages.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.080]   And you can see, it's a central point, and that is 10-year returns on average are almost
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:54.120]   exactly like fundamental return, almost exactly, market return is almost exactly equal to the
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.280]   return from earnings and dividends.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.880]   And you can see here, so I'm going to get very high.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.680]   That would be 2007 up there.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.560]   So I'm going to get very low.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.800]   That would be 2009.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.880]   And you can see the big bumps in the market, 1975 back there.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:18.840]   And once you get way high, and that's 10%, the market return is 10% above the fundamental,
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.200]   it's going to come back.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:27.480]   This is a chart that just screams out market returns revert to fundamental returns over
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.760]   time.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.880]   So you can't worry about all those highs and lows in this chart, you've just got to worry
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.280]   about what the corporations of America and the world do for us.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.480]   So as we look ahead, how does this get us?
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.840]   I don't have very good news for you here.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:51.560]   The return over the last 55, 65 years has been 11% in the stock market, you knew that.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.160]   And investment costs take about 2% out of that, leaving you with a net return of 9,
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:05.520]   I don't know what that 7 is doing there, and the prospect of, I use 4%, 5% earnings growth,
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:12.000]   which is maybe hard to achieve, 2% dividend yield compared to 3.3% in history.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.560]   So if it's 3.3%, you've got to build into the record, and the yield is now 2%, that
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.680]   is a 1.3% dead weight loss in future returns.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.920]   I don't know why people don't understand that.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.880]   When I look at the P/E, the speculative return, this is speculative in both ways.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.680]   And I've assumed here the market's fully valued now, not grossly overvalued, but it's selling
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.680]   about 23 times.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:42.960]   If we're to go down to its long-term norm, 17 times, it would take 3% a year off that
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:48.480]   4% a year, off that 7% a year investment return, getting you to 4.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.840]   I can't tell you it would be 4, it could be better, it could be worse, that's probably
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:57.400]   a kind of a low number, but I think looking at a low number is not a bad idea when you're
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:03.200]   saving because if the catastrophe comes, and you assume the return would be too low, you'll
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.160]   have more money than you ever expected, so that can't hurt you.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.720]   Having less money than you ever expected is pretty tough, so I think it's wise to use
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.760]   a conservative viewpoint in the future.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.580]   And then look at those mutual fund costs.
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:22.400]   Those costs take you from 4% for the active fund to 2%.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.220]   And the index fund, of course, the gross return will be the same as the active fund, and you
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:32.720]   only take 0.05 out of it for an Admiral Share and S&P 500, Vanguard S&P 500, and you get
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.400]   nearly 4%, nearly double the return over the next 10 years, just by getting costs out of
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   the equation.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:47.060]   And the lower the returns are, the higher the burden of costs.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:53.460]   And so people just have to pay attention to costs more than ever if we look ahead and
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:58.680]   get this 4 or 5 or 6%, whatever it turns out to be, a market return.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.880]   So not so good for stocks.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.560]   How about bonds?
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.960]   Ooh, ouch.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:10.160]   The average 10-year U.S. Treasury, that's the normal standard for the risk-free rate
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.120]   over this last 65 years, has been 5.7%.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.920]   Today, it is 1.6%.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:23.640]   I've added on a point in each case, because I don't think you need to stay with a 10-year
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   Treasury.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.240]   I think it's too conservative, too short, and too entirely government, you know, super
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240]   safe.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.240]   So if you take a moderate additional credit risk and a significant interest rate risk
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.040]   versus that Treasury 10-year note, you're going to get a risk-to-return on a bond portfolio
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.760]   of around 2.6% compared to 6.7% in the past.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:50.540]   That seems like a big drop, but it's smaller than you would think, because real returns
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:57.760]   on bonds, that is, the bond return minus the cost of living, CPI, has dropped so much.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.600]   Right now, we're looking at maybe 2% inflation, it could even be 1% ahead, and the past inflation
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.600]   was 3.6.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:12.400]   So the real return was 2.1% in that historical period, not 5.7, which is the nominal return.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:23.240]   And the Treasury portfolio of present return, 2%, would have a nominal return of 1.6, and
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:38.080]   a real return of 2.0%, but minus 0.4, and you'd be at 1.6% for the next 10 years.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.640]   Too bad.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.800]   So how does this look in a balanced portfolio?
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.200]   I'm getting to the end of this thing.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.280]   I thought I said 48 slides, and I'm 52, so I think I made a mistake somewhere.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:54.920]   But for the balanced portfolio, just using those numbers, the 50-year norm of returns
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:01.160]   on the markets, returns on the bond and stock markets, has been 50/50 portfolio.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.640]   It's been 8.75% on the nominal return, 5.15.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.240]   Looking ahead, the nominal return looks like around 3.3%, using those numbers that I've
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:19.040]   given you for stocks and bonds, 50/50, and 1.3% real.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:25.120]   That's before the bond industry gets its hands on your money.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:34.280]   The active funds are going to cost 1.5%, think about what that does to a real return of 1.3%,
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.400]   and that's counting trading costs and expense ratios.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400]   Or you have your choice.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:45.480]   You can buy an index fund, which costs not 1.5, but 0.05, so it makes a big difference
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.640]   indexing, it'll make a big difference to you.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:54.680]   And don't forget, also, that active funds have extra tax costs, they realize capital
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.600]   gains with remarkable frequency, and you've got to pay taxes on them, at least in your
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.440]   non-retirement accounts.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.080]   And then investor behavior.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.700]   And Morningstar will tell you, if a fund has a return of, let me say, 10% a year, the average
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:13.400]   investor in that fund will earn 8.5% a year, because we investors are pretty stupid as
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:19.440]   a group, we buy in a fund that's doing very hot, and when it does hot, it's going to do
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.760]   cold, and when it gets cold, we leave.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.080]   So the fund return is almost inevitably, for any fund you've heard of, the funds that don't
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.040]   have much capital flow, don't have to face this problem.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.880]   But for most funds, you're going to lose 1.5%.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:38.600]   That does not happen in index funds, because it's never so good or so bad to draw money.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:45.880]   Index fund is floating on an idea of capturing the market return, owning the market at less
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:46.880]   cost.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]   And that's all there is to it.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:53.280]   That's not to say, I don't worry about these huge cash flows that are coming into our index
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.360]   funds.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.680]   And that's why I repeat whenever I can, we promise you your fair share of the market
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.480]   return, as I did in the video.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.880]   Don't forget that you will get your fair share when the market goes down, too.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.720]   If the market goes down 20%, you're going to lose 20%.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.640]   There's no way around that.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:15.800]   So it's still the best deal in town, as we'll talk about.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:21.040]   It's going to change the way people invest for a whole lot of reasons.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:26.640]   So to wrap up here, the bad news is, lower expected returns in history would suggest--
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:30.280]   I'm not saying I'm right in any of these numbers, to be very clear on that-- but I'm telling
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:36.920]   you what my reasonable expectations are for future returns.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.040]   These are not predictions.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.000]   Over a decade, implications, investors will have to save more.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.840]   Low cost, more important to ever say the obvious.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.360]   And the domination of index funds will continue and, I think, accelerate.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:53.840]   The Department of Labor Petitiary Rule is going to favor low cost and index funds, particularly
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.720]   in retirement accounts.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.480]   And a greater recognition of the past is not prologue.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.160]   I showed you that number shown, quartiles.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.520]   The past is, in a way, anti-prologue.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:11.020]   It will develop a realistic skepticism about fund managers' consistency, because the more
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.320]   aggressive the manager is, the less consistency the return will show.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.360]   And then, as that fundamental returns versus market returns chart showed you, that 10-year
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.680]   chart, reversion to the mean, RTM, will become part of the dialogue.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680]   That's what funds do.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:32.880]   They revert to the market mean, or worse, and that's what I see in the future.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:39.640]   Let me close by two quotes from Boglehead's 14XIV.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:43.600]   And number one, which is going to really shape the industry, it's happening right now, the
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.160]   Supreme Court has taken a really tough look at mutual fund costs.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:55.480]   In this hearing, Tibble versus Edison, unanimous ruling of the Supreme Court reaffirming fiduciary
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.720]   duty for retirement plan, defense lawyer, "It can't be the case that companies have
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:05.360]   to consistently look and scour the market for cheaper investment options for retirement
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.080]   plan options," the lawyer said.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.400]   Justice Kennedy responds, "Well, you certainly do, if that's what a prudent trustee would
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400]   do."
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.800]   I mean, that's the death knell for high-cost funds right there.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:22.080]   Retirement plan area is a hugely important part, probably half of all mutual fund assets,
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.200]   so that will take its toll.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:29.720]   And then finally, back to the old basics that I use time and time again, you can do worse
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.240]   than go back to Adam Smith, 1776.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:38.920]   And what he tells us there is the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.680]   so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:49.200]   The maximum is so perfectly self-evident, it would be absurd to attempt to prove it.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:59.080]   The interest of the consumer must be the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:04.680]   Turning that into investment language, the fund interest of fund shareholders, the consumers,
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:11.320]   must finally triumph over the interest of fund managers, producers, if you will.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.800]   And that's the way this industry is going to grow.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.680]   That's the way people have come to view the industry.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.540]   Are they getting their fair share?
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:24.080]   And any fund manager that's not putting the interest of the fund shareholder over the
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:30.160]   interest of the fund manager is going to have a very, very tough time getting on the moon.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.160]   Very tough.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.160]   And a lot of them will go out of business.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.080]   There will be a lot of change.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:43.400]   And so before we get to the last slide, just let me say that these verities, this particular
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:50.960]   verity, that the consumer must be put first, means that even if the fiduciary duty to rule,
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:56.400]   which applies only to clients and retirement plans, even if that never develops further,
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.960]   and I believe it should develop a lot further and even cover the people that are running
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:06.440]   all that money, 70% of the market's cap, that's probably $18 or $19 trillion, ought to also
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.920]   be held to a fiduciary duty standard.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:16.280]   Indeed, I would, in my tough way, say if you touch a penny of other people's money, you
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   are a fiduciary and you've got to put the shareholder's interest first.
