[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   does this model want to kill us?
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.420]   What does this model fundamentally want?
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.920]   - We can be in a position where we can
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.300]   look at the broad features of the model and say like,
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.460]   is this a model whose internal state and plans
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.300]   is devoted to doing what looked like
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.720]   fairly destructive and manipulative things?
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.520]   I give an analogy to humans.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.220]   It's actually possible to look at an MRI of someone
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.060]   and predict above random chance
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.820]   whether they're a psychopath.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.560]   There was actually a story a few years back
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.360]   about a neuroscientist who was studying this
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.560]   and then looked at his own scan
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.360]   and discovered that he was a psychopath.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480]   Is this something we can afford to be empirical about?
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.400]   Or do we need like some deep root math proof
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.240]   that this is aligned?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.960]   I've actually always been a fan of studying these circuits
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.500]   at the lowest level of detail that we possibly can.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.960]   That's how you build up knowledge
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.500]   by trying to make a lot of these very specific discoveries.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.880]   Like you have to understand the building blocks
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.420]   and then you have to figure out how to use that
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.500]   to draw these broad conclusions even if you're not going to figure out everything.
