[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   I know a lot of the podcasts we talk about travel, I know a lot of our listeners love
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.300]   to travel.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.360]   And so one of the times people are often most excited to learn a language is that, you know,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.960]   maybe they planned a trip or they have this, like you said, in China, a vision for a trip
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.000]   they want to take.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.560]   Not everyone who is planning a trip to a foreign country necessarily feels like they need to
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.120]   become fluent.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.160]   Is there a stop along the way where you can have enough kind of skills in a language to
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.080]   have a different experience traveling and unlock, you know, really interesting things
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   that you can get to a lot quicker and any advice for someone in that situation?
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.200]   When it comes to language levels, there is a lot of specificity with this, and this is
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.800]   something I take into account with my targets.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.000]   So I always work off the European Common Framework, which has a very specific way of categorizing
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.200]   language levels.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   It splits it into A, B, and C, and within each one, it further sub splits it into one
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.840]   and two.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.060]   So A is beginner, B is intermediate, C is advanced, one is lower, two is upper.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.280]   So A2 means you're an advanced beginner and C1 means you're a lower level mastery speaker
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280]   of the language.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.120]   So this scale of six different levels is where I pin everything.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.880]   So for me, fluency begins at the B2 level.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760]   This is upper intermediate.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.480]   So what that means is you can talk about most things you would talk about in casual social
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.800]   situations, but because you're not at the C levels, you don't have a mastery level.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.080]   So in my case, I studied engineering.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.920]   So the languages I have a C level at, I could work as an engineer in those languages and
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.680]   I could have a philosophical conversation with you about very deep subjects.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.160]   And for the most part, most conversations I'm going to have are the high level B2 social
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.620]   conversations.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.360]   So that's what I'm aiming for.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.960]   And it's important on the scale to remove perfectionism because even the C2 is still
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.080]   not perfect.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.640]   It means that you can work functionally through the language the same way you would in your
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   mother tongue.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.600]   Now on the same scale, I think that at the A2 level, upper beginner, this is where you
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.160]   can function very confidently as an independent tourist in the language.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.320]   So you can ask for directions, you can get the gist of their reply, you can deal with
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.840]   problems like you have an injury and you can get yourself to the hospital.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.240]   All of these very basic functional things you can do with confidence, even though you
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.640]   can't necessarily have full on conversations.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.180]   And I think that is fine for somebody who's going to the country briefly, and it is something
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.680]   you could genuinely get to in a lot shorter of a time than people realize.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.800]   The very steep curve at the beginning, you can make a lot of progress very quickly.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120]   What tends to happen is we reach the intermediate plateau.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.280]   This is where things start to get really rough, where you're putting as much effort in, but
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.120]   you get stuck at the middle level.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.440]   And this will happen to everybody and that's okay as long as you can push through to very
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.980]   beginning stages that B1 I feel is something that is definitely achievable in the matter
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.960]   of a certain amount of months for people, regardless of your background, if you're able
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   to put the time in.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.060]   A B1 level means you can have a lot of conversations with people as long as they're a little patient
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.060]   with you.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.840]   So it does not count as fluency, but it counts as conversational.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.440]   And for me, this is where I love to be in my travels because I can start to make friends
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.520]   in the language.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.960]   I can really hang out with people.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.160]   If you're single, you can go on dates with people.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.940]   You can do a lot with that B1 level.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.540]   So this for me is a minimum to feel like I'm truly experiencing the culture in a lot more
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300]   of a direct way.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.840]   Anything less than that is more a case of how confident a tourist you're going to be,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.080]   which in itself can be a wonderful thing.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.220]   You can have a lot of great experiences, but ultimately you are going to be doing most
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.400]   of your things in English if you're only at an A2 level, which means your interactions,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.480]   your friends and so on.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.260]   So it depends on your style of travel.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.440]   My style of travel obviously is I avoid English.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.640]   I want to make only local friends.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.160]   So I have to get at least a B1 level.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.200]   And that's where, when you said at the beginning, Benny speaks 12 languages, that number 12
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.800]   comes from B1 and up.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.360]   So I personally only say I speak a language if I can have conversations in the language,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.800]   not if I would function as a tourist.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.400]   So I actually have another dozen languages that I could function as a tourist quite confidently.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.960]   But the thing is, that's not as impressive as it sounds because you could do that a lot
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.400]   quicker than people realize.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   You can be a very confident tourist.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.820]   You can have a bunch of phrases ready to go in a very, very short time span.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.360]   So you can be a confident tourist way faster than you imagine, especially if you're having
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.560]   consistent conversations ahead of time.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   I did for a while travel to the country and think I'm going to get off the plane and immediately
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.720]   start speaking the language or start learning the language.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.560]   And that was an interesting period in my life.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.020]   But nowadays I try to learn the language ahead of time.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.200]   So I don't leave it for when I'm in the country.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.560]   I don't think, especially for people who can only travel to a country for a very limited
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.960]   amount of time, I don't want to be in language learning mode if I'm only going to be in a
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.840]   country for a month or two, I want to really get to know the place.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.800]   So that's why I do my work ahead of time and then I can explore and make friends once I
