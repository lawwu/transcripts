[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   There's really nothing more glorious than to know that Christ reigns over my life.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.720]   He reigns over this world, He reigns over the cosmos, over every creature and over every
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.300]   power in creation.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.760]   So much of the Christian life is rediscovering and re-savoring this fundamental truth that
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.000]   everything hangs on Jesus.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.960]   In his conference message, "Sex and the Supremacy of Christ, Part 2," delivered on September
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.160]   26, 2004, Pastor John reiterates this point with the proper rhetorical flair.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.920]   Here's a clip of what he said.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:48.360]   My prayer is that you will know, that you will press on to know the supremacy of Christ,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.260]   the supremacy of His deity, equal with God the Father in all of His attributes, the radiance
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.200]   of His glory and the exact image of His nature.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.520]   The supremacy of His eternality that makes the mind want to explode with the imponderable
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.120]   thought that Jesus Christ never had a beginning.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.600]   He is simply there.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:29.980]   Absolute reality with which we reckon we must rise to the supremacy of His eternality
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.460]   while all the universe, including this building in your body and this earth and all the galaxies
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.540]   are fragile, contingent, like a shadow in comparison to the substance of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.700]   We must know the supremacy of His never-changing constancy.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.260]   Oh, to have virtues that never change, a character whose commitment is constant yesterday, today,
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.260]   and forever.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.500]   Let us know the supremacy of His constancy and let us know the supremacy of His knowledge
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.980]   that makes the Library of Congress look like a matchbox and makes all the information on
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.340]   the internet look like a 1940's farmer's almanac and makes all of quantum physics and everything
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.840]   that Stephen Hawking has ever dreamed look like a first-grade reader.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.700]   We must know the supremacy of the knowledge of our Lord.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.500]   We must know the supremacy of His wisdom that has never been perplexed by any problem whatsoever,
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.420]   nor can He be counseled by any person or any being in the universe.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.820]   We must know the supremacy of His authority.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.420]   All authority is mine in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.100]   No change.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.980]   All authority.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.260]   Changing times and seasons, removing kings, setting up kings, doing according to His will
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.580]   in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth, no one can stay His hand or
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.900]   say to Him, "What have you done?"
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.480]   We must know the supremacy of His providence, without which not a single bird in the extended
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.660]   reaches of the Amazon forest has ever fallen off of any limb and without which not one
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.980]   hair turns white or black.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.220]   We must know the providence of Jesus.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.060]   We must know the supremacy of His Word, which upholds the universe by the Word of His power.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.140]   All the galaxies, molecules, atoms, and subatomic reality nobody has yet dreamed of down there
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.460]   where no one has yet looked.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.580]   We must know the supremacy of His power to walk on water and cleanse lepers and heal
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.580]   the lame and open the eyes of the blind and open the ears of the deaf and cause storms
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.860]   to cease and with two words to raise the dead, "Lazarus, come forth," or one word to raise
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.860]   the dead.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.820]   "In your blood," I said to you, "live."
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.420]   We must know the supremacy of His power.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.180]   We must know the supremacy of His purity.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.420]   He never sinned.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.020]   He never sinned.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.400]   He never had one millisecond of a bad attitude or a sinful lust.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.240]   We must know the supremacy of His trustworthiness.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.180]   He never breaks a promise.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.460]   He always keeps His Word absolutely without fail.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.340]   We must know the supremacy of His justice.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:52.380]   He will render all accounts settled in the end in the universe either on the cross or
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.460]   in hell.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.220]   No injustice will remain when Christ is finished with His supreme justice.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.400]   We must know the supremacy of His patience.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.800]   He has endured you and me for decades.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.980]   He has endured this city and brings the sun.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.460]   Can you imagine why the sun rose on this city this morning, this wicked city, this world
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.520]   so full of us-type sinners and He makes paradise rise in the sky in Minneapolis?
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.300]   What kind of patience are we dealing with here?
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.760]   We must know the supremacy of His servant-like sovereign obedience.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.980]   Kept every one of His Father's commands absolutely and in the end embraced the cross with total
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.540]   willingness.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.560]   We must know the supremacy of His meekness and lowliness and tenderness.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.040]   He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering flax.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.480]   We must know the supremacy of His wrath.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:04.040]   One day it will explode on this world from heaven such that all who have rejected Him
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.920]   will call for rocks to crush their brain lest they have to face the wrath of the Lamb.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.960]   We must know this when I look at the beheadings.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.840]   And I hear someone ask, "Where is your supreme Christ?"
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   My answer is really easy.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   He is in heaven storing up almighty wrath in fury to pour out on all those who commit
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   such sins.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.120]   That's where He is and you better get right with Him and repent or you will all likewise
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   perish.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.680]   It's not a hard question to answer biblically.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.220]   We must know the supremacy of His grace which gives to the spiritually dead rebels like
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:58.520]   us life, wakens faith in hellbound haters of God, justifies the ungodly with His own
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.280]   righteousness.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.940]   We must know the supremacy of His love which dies for us while we are yet sinners and gives
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:14.640]   to the absolutely undeserving the ability for ever increasing joy in making much of
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   Him.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   We must know the supremacy of His gladness.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.640]   In the fellowship of the Trinity, infinite power, infinite energy, infinite joy rising,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.100]   spilling over in the creation of a universe and becoming for you one day an inheritance
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.240]   for every struggling saint.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.400]   We must know.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.840]   This is what we were made for.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.440]   Press on to know the Lord.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.880]   We are made to know Christ.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.840]   We're not made to do little diddly things.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.380]   We're made to know this massive Christ.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.920]   This world is a little two second slice and then with Him or not forever.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:09.000]   It's what we are created to know and do and be about and when we know Him in those ways
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.840]   we have begun to know the outskirts of His supremacy for time would fail to speak of
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:25.280]   His supreme severity and invincibility and dignity and simplicity and complexity and
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.600]   resoluteness and calmness and depth and courage.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.200]   If there is anything admirable, if there is anything worthy of praise in all the universe,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.000]   it is summed up in Jesus Christ.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.060]   He is always infinitely admirable in everything and over everything supreme.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.900]   Over all galaxies and endless reaches of space.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.560]   Over the earth from the top of Mount Everest, 29,000 feet up to the bottom of the Pacific
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.760]   Ocean, 36,000 feet down in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Rim.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.040]   He is sovereign and supreme over all plants and animals from the peaceful blue whale to
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.000]   the microscopic killer viruses.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.600]   He is supreme over all weather and all movements of the earth, hurricanes, tornadoes, monsoons,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.400]   earthquakes, avalanches, floods, snow, rain, sleet.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:33.920]   He is supreme over all chemical processes that heal or destroy cancer, AIDS, malaria,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:41.680]   flu, and all the amazing grace of antibiotics and a thousand healing drugs that we do not
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.760]   deserve.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.920]   He is supreme over all countries and governments and armies.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.120]   He is supreme over al-Qaeda and the terrorists and the kidnappings and the suicide bombings
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.360]   and the beheadings.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.200]   He is supreme over bin Laden and al-Zarqawi.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.680]   He is supreme over all nuclear threats from Iran and Russia and North Korea.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.320]   He is supreme over politics and elections and debates on Thursday.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.840]   He's supreme over media and news and entertainment and sports and leisure.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.120]   He's supreme over all education in universities, no matter what they teach.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.640]   And he's supreme over all scholarship and science and research.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.080]   He's supreme over all business and finance and industry and manufacturing and transportation.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.960]   And he's supreme over the internet and all informational systems.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.920]   As Abraham Kuyper famously said, and many of you know, "There is not one square inch
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   on planet earth over which the risen Christ does not say, 'Mine!'
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.480]   And I rule it.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.960]   I am supreme over it."
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   So good.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.360]   That's it from the conference message, "Sex and the Supremacy of Christ, Part 2," delivered
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.160]   on September 26, 2004.
