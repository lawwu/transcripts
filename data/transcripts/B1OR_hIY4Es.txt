[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260]   Unfortunately, the first few moments of this lecture
[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.980]   by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones on the subject
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.140]   of the doctrine of the church are missing.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.820]   We join him, however, as he's discussing the importance
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.140]   of a thorough understanding of this doctrine
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.780]   in the light of the modern ecumenical movement.
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.620]   - That it really is the duty of every Christian
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.180]   to take an intelligent interest in this matter.
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.900]   Whatever your decisions and your conclusions may be,
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.460]   we at Emirate ought to have a point of view and an opinion
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.460]   so that as others put this matter before us,
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.220]   we should be able to give a reason
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.620]   for the hope that is in us.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.140]   And so we began our consideration
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.100]   of this doctrine of the church.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.540]   We dealt with definitions, we dealt with the pictures
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.840]   that are used in the scriptures
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.900]   in order to present the doctrine concerning the church.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.580]   The church is compared to a body,
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.820]   it's compared to a building, it's compared to an empire,
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.500]   it's compared to a bride,
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.220]   and there are other comparisons also.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.300]   And we ended off by considering the relationship
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.400]   of the church to the state.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.860]   But, and I shall have to return to it again this evening,
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.180]   that's why I mention it once more,
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.220]   we began by trying to show the relationship
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.300]   between the kingdom of God and the church,
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.120]   and the reason for that will emerge in a moment.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.460]   Well now, we resume this evening by considering
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.460]   what is generally called the marks of the church,
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.840]   or if you like, the characteristic notes of the church.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.340]   What are the marks of the church?
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.900]   What are the things that make a church a church?
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.940]   What is the church here for, particularly?
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.100]   What is she to do?
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.140]   What does she do when she shows that she is the church?
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.060]   Now that's a very important question,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.900]   because historically, again,
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.140]   there have been a number of answers given to this question.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.860]   Now the common Protestant teaching with regard to this
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.860]   is that there are three main marks or notes of the church.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.860]   The first is the preaching of the word.
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.140]   That is the first and the primary business
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.340]   of the Christian church,
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.700]   and she was created and called into being primarily
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.220]   that she might do that.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.020]   She is for the preaching of the word,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.360]   and that is something which is done in two main respects.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.260]   The word is preached in the church for the up-building
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.060]   and the establishing of the saints, of the believers.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.020]   They have come together, as we saw, in fellowship.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.740]   That is what the church is in a sense.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.980]   She is a fellowship of those who are believers in Christ
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.100]   and who recognize his headship and his lordship.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.980]   And inevitably, they are brought together because of that.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.140]   And the word is preached in order that they may be
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.260]   strengthened, that they may be established in the faith,
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.300]   that they may be built up in their faith.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.640]   These New Testament epistles were written to such people
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.860]   with that definite end and object in view.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.060]   The apostles did the same, the prophets did the same.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.220]   The fact that the man was converted didn't mean
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.140]   that he reached the end of the story.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.140]   Indeed, it was but the beginning of the story.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.620]   He'd been born as a babe in Christ, and he needs instruction.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.660]   He needs to be warned against error,
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.500]   to be safeguarded against heresy,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.820]   so that the church is essential to the believer
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.160]   in order that he may receive this preaching,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.840]   this instruction.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   Preaching takes many forms,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.840]   but we can sum it up in that one word.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.860]   The word is preached to the end that the saints
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.240]   may be up built and established.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   And the second object of preaching, of course,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.740]   is evangelization.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.600]   The word is preached to those who are not believers.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.220]   And it is the peculiar task of the Christian church
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.000]   to do this.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.480]   Our Lord in his high priestly prayer, you remember,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.640]   which is recorded in the 17th chapter of John,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.840]   he puts that quite specifically,
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.160]   that as the Father had sent him into the world,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.600]   so he is sending these, his immediate followers,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   and those who should believe the word through them,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.300]   they are sent into the world in exactly the same way.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.780]   He came bearing the message of the kingdom.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.200]   We are sent bearing the message of the kingdom.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.320]   But in particular, I say that it is a part of the work
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.200]   of the church as such to preach this gospel
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.800]   to those who are outside,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.480]   in order that they may be convinced
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.800]   and convicted of their sin,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.340]   and in order that they may be led to a living vital faith
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.760]   in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.680]   That then is the first mark of the church,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   preaching the word.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.640]   The second mark and characteristic of the church
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.800]   is the administration of the sacraments.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.880]   The administration of the sacraments.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.840]   Now, I'm not stopping with this at this moment
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.680]   because I'm proposing to deal with the doctrine
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.320]   of the sacraments on its own.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.080]   But I have to mention it at this point
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.800]   because it is one of the marks of the church.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   The church is a place in which the sacraments
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.600]   are rightly administered and truly administered
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.920]   in connection with the preaching of the word.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.820]   So that in order to make our list of three complete,
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.360]   we mention it at this point.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.660]   But let me hurry on to the third mark of the church,
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.880]   which is in a sense the one I'm anxious to emphasize
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.440]   most of all because it's so sadly neglected.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.500]   The third mark of the church is the exercise of discipline.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.560]   Now, I wonder if we had just put the question
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.480]   at the beginning instead of speaking.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.880]   And what if I put this question,
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.200]   what are the three marks of the church?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.040]   I wonder how many would have put discipline,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   the exercise of discipline,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.600]   as one of the essential marks of the Christian church.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   There is no doubt at all,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.320]   but that this doctrine of all doctrines
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   is grievously and sadly neglected.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.240]   Indeed, if I were asked the question myself,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.840]   if I were asked to explain why it is things are
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.540]   as they are in the church,
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.600]   if I were asked to explain why the statistics show
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.440]   the dwindling numbers and the lack of power
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.760]   and the lack of influence upon men,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.480]   if I were asked to explain why it is that so many churches
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.100]   seem to be incapable of sustaining the cause
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.940]   without resorting to whist drives and dances
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.240]   and things like that,
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.400]   as they are one sees all over the country increasingly,
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.200]   if I were asked to explain why it is the church
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.040]   is in this powerless condition,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.120]   I think that for myself, I should have to say
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.520]   that the ultimate cause of it all
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.580]   is the failure to exercise discipline.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.920]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.320]   When did you last hear any reference
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.960]   from a Christian pulpit to the subject of discipline?
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.960]   How often have you heard sermons on discipline
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.800]   or addresses on discipline?
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.880]   The word has almost gone right out of existence
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.000]   and what it stands for and represents
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.560]   has fallen into desertitude as regards practice.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.080]   Now, unfortunately, this is not merely neglected.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.200]   There are numbers of people who would even try
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.920]   to justify the neglect.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.100]   And it is because of that that I want to go fairly fully
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.040]   into this subject.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.800]   On what grounds do I suggest
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.840]   that discipline should be exercised?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   Well, it is purely, of course, on scriptural grounds.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.840]   Take some of the scriptures.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.240]   First of all, in the 18th chapter of the gospel,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.480]   according to St. Matthew,
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.540]   beginning at verse 15,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.920]   moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.760]   go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.040]   If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.880]   But if he will not hear thee,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.840]   then take with thee one or two more
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   that in the mouth of two or three witnesses,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.400]   every word may be established.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.200]   And if he shall neglect to hear them,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.840]   tell it unto the church.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.000]   But if he neglect to hear the church,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   let him be unto thee as unheathened men and a publican.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.260]   Those are the words of our Lord himself.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.960]   Matthew 18, 15 to 18.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.560]   And listen to it in the epistles.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.900]   Take Romans 16, 17, for instance.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.380]   Mark them, says Paul, which cause divisions and offenses
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.120]   contrary to the doctrine which he have learned,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   and avoid them.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.880]   Look at it in that fifth chapter
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.080]   of the first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.220]   which I read at the beginning.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.960]   It's the whole theme of that chapter,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.680]   ending with these words.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.560]   Therefore, put away from among you that wicked person.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.820]   Nothing could be more explicit than that.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.620]   You've got it again in the second epistle
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.160]   to the Corinthians in the second chapter,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.880]   especially verses five to 10,
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.500]   where he talks about receiving back
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.820]   this man who'd been disciplined.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.180]   You've got it in the second epistle
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.200]   to the Thessalonians in the third chapter,
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.940]   where he gives instructions as to what should be done
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.380]   with men who are living a disorderly life,
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.780]   as members of the church.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.220]   Then in Titus, the epistle to Titus,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.180]   the third chapter in the 10th verse,
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.940]   there is this explicit command.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.380]   A man that is an heretic after the first
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.500]   and second admonition, reject.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.140]   Titus 3, 10.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.960]   In the second epistle of John,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.740]   you've got it as we saw last Friday night,
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.260]   especially in the 10th verse.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.460]   And of course, the various letters to the churches
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.300]   in the book of Revelation are simply exhortations
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.860]   to the exercise of discipline.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.500]   But I say that in spite of that,
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.980]   there are those who would even try to justify
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.260]   the absence or the lack of discipline.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.180]   And strangely enough, there are so many who do so,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.820]   one is constantly hearing it,
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.140]   in terms of the parable of the tares,
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.140]   which we read at the beginning out of the 13th chapter
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.540]   of the gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.520]   Oh, they say, but you mustn't discipline.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.620]   They say, our Lord's own teaching is,
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.380]   let them grow together until the harvest.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.940]   They say, if you begin to exercise discipline in the church
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.420]   and to put people out of the church,
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.180]   well, you're contravening our Lord's own instructions.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.460]   He says, let them grow together.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.700]   When the servants came and said,
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.820]   shall we pull up those tares and destroy them?
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.020]   He said, no, lest you may uproot the wheat at the same time.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.540]   Let them grow together until the harvest.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.060]   So that there are those who object to discipline
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.420]   in the church, I mean the local church,
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.460]   and there are those further who object to any separation
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.220]   of the Christian people from what they may regard
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.660]   an apostate church on exactly the same grounds.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.900]   They don't believe in discipline at all.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.420]   And their argument is the parable of the tares.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.380]   And of course it's a very grievous and serious
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.020]   misinterpretation of scripture.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.600]   Because the parable of the tares, obviously and patently,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.260]   does not refer to the church, but to the kingdom.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.380]   All these parables are parables of the kingdom.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.260]   And that was why I took the trouble last Friday evening
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.540]   to find out that the church and the kingdom
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.820]   are not identical.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.420]   The church is one expression of the kingdom,
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.320]   but the kingdom is bigger than the church.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.820]   And of course our Lord himself explicitly says
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.860]   in his own interpretation of this very parable,
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.340]   the field in which the wheat and the tares are sown
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.380]   is not the church, but the world.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.220]   The good seed are the children of the kingdom,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.660]   but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.940]   So that the parable of the tares has no bearing
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.700]   upon the question of discipline within the church.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.500]   It is a picture of the whole world,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.580]   which as I pointed out last Sunday night,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.100]   last Friday night, belongs to God,
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.080]   and can therefore in that general sense
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.700]   be regarded as his kingdom still.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.780]   But within that you've got these two groups.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.720]   Those who are Christians, those who really belong
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.900]   to the eternal kingdom, and those who belong to the devil.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.620]   But it is not a parable with respect to the church.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.180]   And to apply this teaching to the church, of course,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.940]   is simply to fall into the same error
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.260]   as the Roman Catholics have always done,
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260]   and which most churches that follow their church
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.180]   have equally tended to do.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.180]   That is why in a sense, you see,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.060]   you have no discipline in the Roman Catholic church.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.380]   That is why it is possible for people to be regarded
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.700]   as perfectly good Christians,
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.820]   whose lives may be even riotous.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.700]   They are not disciplined,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.620]   they're not put out of the church for that.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.540]   And indeed, the same thing is true in general
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.280]   of the Anglican church.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.740]   The Anglican church, again, because of a view of herself,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.340]   does not believe in disciplining the individual member.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.420]   But the view of the church,
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.540]   which we put forward last Friday night,
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.460]   in a sense demands that there should be discipline.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.740]   And furthermore, as I've been showing this evening
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.420]   from these scriptures,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.000]   it is something to which we are exhorted repeatedly
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.340]   and strongly in the scriptures themselves.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.320]   And you've noticed that discipline is to be exercised
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.300]   along two main lines.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   First of all, it is to be exercised
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.020]   with respect to doctrine.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.520]   A man who is an heretic after the first
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.480]   and the second admonition is to be put out,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.520]   is to be rejected.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.440]   If a man doesn't bear the true doctrine,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.640]   well, says John, you mustn't receive him at all,
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.360]   not even into your house, leave alone into the church.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.600]   Let me make this clear.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.820]   I believe someone was a little bit troubled
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.140]   about this last Friday and took it to mean this,
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.060]   that I was teaching on the basis of scripture,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.340]   that Christians should never admit an unbeliever
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.020]   into their house.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.820]   Of course, it means nothing of the sort.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   What it means is this,
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.260]   if a man who claims not only to be a Christian,
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.500]   but a teacher of the church, a minister,
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.780]   if such a man is teaching error,
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.340]   you certainly must not receive him into your house.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.940]   But of course you receive the unbeliever into your house
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.180]   in order that you may talk to him about these things.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.060]   Well, Paul puts it perfectly
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.260]   in the fifth chapter of 1 Corinthians
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.580]   that we read together just now.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.780]   He said, in all these matters of discipline,
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.580]   he said, I'm not referring to those who are out in the world
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.840]   because if you have to keep yourself from all those,
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.180]   it would just mean that you've got to go
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.260]   right out of the world.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.100]   He says, I'm not saying that, but I do say this,
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.620]   that if a man who is a brother is guilty of these things,
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.480]   don't keep company with him.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   Now that applies to doctrine, it also applies to practice.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.620]   So the New Testament tells us
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.700]   that we really must be concerned
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.200]   about doctrine in the church,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.540]   and that we must do something
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.220]   about false doctrine in the church.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.220]   And I think the whole situation confronting us today
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.220]   is abundant proof of the terrible consequences
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.140]   of failing to do with it.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.700]   I don't hesitate to assert
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.600]   that it was our grandfathers and great-grandfathers
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.800]   in the last century
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.300]   who failed to exercise the discipline they should have done
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.280]   when that fatal higher criticism
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.760]   began to come in from Germany.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.200]   It was because they failed to discipline the men
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.440]   who believed such things and taught them
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.640]   that we are witnessing the present situation.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.460]   With a false tolerance and an often misunderstanding
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.920]   of the teaching of the parable of the tares,
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.780]   they just allowed it, hoping that things
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.060]   would soon be better, and so on,
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.520]   and talked about maintaining the positive witness
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.720]   and not being negative.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.400]   And we, you and I, and this present generation,
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   are reaping the consequences of such tragic fallacy
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.860]   on the part of church leaders.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.960]   We've got to exercise discipline with regard to doctrine,
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.960]   but we equally have to exercise it
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.040]   with regard to life and living.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.600]   Because whatever the church may preach,
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.360]   if the members of the church are deniers of it
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.040]   in their lives and in their practice,
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.560]   who is going to believe it?
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.280]   It's the negation of what our Lord says,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.240]   "Let your light so shine amongst men
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.220]   "that they may see your good works
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.920]   "and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.200]   An inconsistent or a sinful life on the part of a believer
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.100]   does incalculable harm to the cause of Christ.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.340]   It doesn't matter how orthodox a man is,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.940]   if he doesn't control himself and discipline himself,
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.700]   his temper, his desires, his lusts, his passions,
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.460]   whatever it is, he is in words and in actions
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.980]   denying the faith he preaches,
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.580]   and is an obstacle and an offense to those who are outside.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.900]   Well, the teaching is that if this continues and persists,
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.780]   and if such a brother does not reform himself
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.180]   and pay heed to correction,
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.460]   that he must actually be put out of the church.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.020]   You may have to commit him to Satan,
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.340]   a phrase which is used there by Paul, you remember,
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.300]   for the correction of the flesh, he says,
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.280]   the punishment of the flesh
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.720]   in order that his soul may be saved.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.460]   We don't know exactly what that means,
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.160]   but it probably means something like this,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.020]   that you not only put him out of the membership,
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.380]   but you stop praying for him.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.020]   You hand him over to Satan, as it were,
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.140]   and Satan will cause him to suffer,
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.820]   perhaps in his body and in his flesh.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.580]   He'll become wretched and miserable and unhappy,
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.700]   and that may bring him to his senses,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.980]   that his soul may be saved.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   Well, there it is, it's a great subject,
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.300]   but unfortunately, I can't stay with it, we must go on.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.020]   The three marks of the church, therefore,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.500]   are the preaching of the word,
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.740]   the true administration of the sacraments,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.300]   the exercise of discipline.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.140]   Let me say a final word about this,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.140]   because I regard it as so important.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.060]   Read the history of the church
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.500]   at any time of revival and of reawakening,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.500]   I don't care when,
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.460]   and you will find that invariably,
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.600]   the outstanding mark of the church at such a time
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.360]   is the exercise of discipline.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.580]   Read, for instance, about a man like John Wesley.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.860]   If ever there was a disciplinarian in the church,
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.600]   it was that man.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.460]   Read his journals.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.700]   You'll find that on one occasion,
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.460]   he went over to visit the church,
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.940]   the class meeting at Dublin,
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:55.580]   and he puts a laconic remark like this in his journal.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.340]   He arrives there and he finds
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.500]   that there were about 600 strung,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.460]   and then he began to examine the church,
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.980]   and he examined them one by one,
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.380]   and when he'd finished, the church numbered 300.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.620]   In just a few days.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.860]   One wonders sometimes what John Wesley would do today
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.700]   if he returned.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:20.240]   But it's not only true of Wesley,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.180]   it is true of all branches of the church
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.500]   at periods of revival and of reawakening.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.940]   These men are always concerned
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.060]   about the purity of the church, of necessity.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.820]   Look at the New Testament, they go back to that,
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.400]   and they simply try to live a life
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.760]   in accord with the New Testament teaching.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.000]   And the New Testament exhorts us to have a pure church,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.440]   a clean church.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.000]   The vessel, the instrument, the channel that God uses
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.020]   must surely be pure.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.240]   So the teaching is not only of a gathered church,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.920]   but of a pure church.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.440]   How can a church that's mixed up
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.400]   with the world in various respects,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.320]   how can such a church be the channel of the Holy Ghost?
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   The thing is almost inconceivable.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.540]   Well, there it is.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.680]   One of the marks of the church is discipline.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.120]   Let me hurry to say just something
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.920]   about the government of the church.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.120]   Again, as with every aspect of this great doctrine,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.140]   it's a highly debatable and controversial matter.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.520]   There have been all sorts of ideas with respect to this.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.440]   It's interesting to notice that in a sense,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.280]   the New Testament is not very specific about this.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.180]   In other words, it doesn't give us detailed instruction
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.600]   as it does with regard to many other doctrines.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.440]   And undoubtedly that was the case
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.020]   because most of our New Testament doctrines
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.360]   have referenced to the church
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.880]   while the apostles were still alive.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.520]   And while the apostles and prophets
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.680]   were able to do these things and put them into practice.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.520]   But I think you'll agree with this,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.180]   that as you go on with the New Testament,
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.660]   I mean by that as you read those parts of the New Testament
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.920]   that were the last to be written,
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.560]   like the pastoral epistles and things like that,
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.840]   you will notice an obvious and a definite
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.400]   increase in the teaching
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.800]   with regard to order in the church
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.760]   and the ordering of the life
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   and the government of the church,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.480]   which is of course precisely what one would have expected.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.280]   But you know, even in the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   you get the apostles ordaining elders
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.480]   and giving instructions
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.200]   as to how the life of the church should be ordered.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.160]   But as this went on, of course,
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.120]   the thing developed more and more.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:51.440]   Therefore, I say that we have very little specific teaching,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.600]   but a clear indication that more and more such order
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.520]   in connection with the government of the church
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.560]   would be necessary.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.800]   But I must add this, of course,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.440]   that what causes the confusion to us
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.000]   in our age and generation
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.960]   is that subsequent to the period
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.380]   of the apostles and prophets
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.960]   and subsequent to the teaching of the scripture,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.520]   the church herself began to do things and to add things
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.720]   which cannot always be found in the scripture
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.760]   and thereby created a tradition
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.480]   that is oftentimes even in contradiction to the scripture,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.080]   as I'll show you in a moment.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.200]   Well, there is a general statement.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.160]   Well, now let us approach it like this.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.920]   What are the main ideas that have been current
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.640]   in the church herself throughout the centuries
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.840]   with regard to this question of church government?
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.760]   Well, the first group is a group
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.320]   that doesn't believe in any church government at all.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.480]   And there are representatives of that view today
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.640]   in the Christian church.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.900]   I needn't mention the names.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.920]   You're probably familiar with many of them.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.240]   They say that there is no need for any order
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.640]   or government as such,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.080]   that all the members come together
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.240]   and are obedient to the spirit.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.760]   Now, this has generally emerged as a reaction
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.800]   against what we may call ecclesiasticism,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.320]   or if you prefer it, it's a reaction against Christendom.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.960]   That awful idea which is summed up in the word Christendom.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.000]   Now, the tendency, I say,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.760]   not to believe in any church government at all
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.080]   comes in as a reaction against that.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.520]   And let us admit quite frankly
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   that there is a great deal to be said for it.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.040]   The Christian church, unfortunately,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.800]   when the Roman empire became Christian
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.240]   or decided to call itself Christian,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.400]   the Christian church borrowed many ideas
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.960]   from the Roman empire and systems of government.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.520]   And for myself, let me admit it quite frankly,
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   I cannot see the modern Roman Catholic church
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.960]   in the scriptures.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.900]   I once put that question to a Roman Catholic priest
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.760]   with whom I was discussing these matters.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.080]   I said, "Can you tell me quite honestly,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.520]   can you see your church as she is today
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.360]   in the New Testament?"
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.920]   And he was honest enough to admit that he couldn't.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.200]   But of course he added, as they do add,
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.840]   "Ah, yes, but revelation has been given since.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.320]   And tradition, you see, is equal to the scriptures."
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.080]   That is their attempted reply.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:43.000]   Now, I say, we can well understand the reaction against that
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.440]   and against all this kind of ecclesiasticism,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   this mixture again of church and state
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.080]   and the elevation of men and of offices
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.520]   and things of that kind.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.800]   It's very easy to understand people reacting
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.600]   so violently against that as to say,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.000]   "Well, I don't believe in any order at all."
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.920]   They say, "Any order is dangerous.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.880]   If you elevate a man, he'll soon add
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.080]   to what you've given him.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.300]   And you'll in the end have this tremendous edifice again,
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.700]   which will be crushing the life of the spirit."
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.400]   These people say, "It is the machine
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.720]   that always kills the spirit.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.640]   It's the organization that quenches the spirit.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.480]   And it's become so involved and hidebound and stiff
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.600]   that the Holy Spirit is not given an opportunity to work.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.880]   And the result is that whenever you get a revival,
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.360]   well, in history, it has almost invariably led
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.960]   to the formation of a new denomination
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.640]   because the old ecclesiastical body couldn't contain it.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.240]   It was too much alive and it was a disturbing element.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.360]   And such people eventually found themselves outside."
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.280]   So there is a great deal to be said for this.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   And yet I do ask whether it is really scriptural.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.120]   I do ask whether it really has taken note
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.400]   of all that is taught in the scriptures,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   whether a definite office is indicated
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.360]   and certain functions ascribed to such offices.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.680]   Or perhaps the final argument is this,
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.480]   that it is one thing to say that you don't believe
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.520]   in any leadership at all.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.760]   But it's a very different thing to have a church
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.800]   in practice in which there are no self-appointed leaders.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.760]   Leadership is inevitable.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.360]   And if you don't put it on paper,
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.920]   somebody will see to it that it comes into being.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.320]   Well, if you're to have leadership,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.880]   let's be as scriptural as we can.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.960]   And let's base our church order
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.880]   upon the teaching of the scriptures.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   I pass to the second conception
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.240]   with regard to church government,
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.000]   which is the one I referred to at the end last week,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.480]   the Erastian idea,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.680]   which means that the church is a function of the state
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.520]   and that therefore the state governs the church.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.480]   The state appoints the officers of the church,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.360]   the high dignitaries particularly,
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.880]   and they in turn appoint others.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.640]   There is no power given to the local member at all.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.920]   The ordinary member has no say.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.200]   It's entirely in other hands.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.480]   And discipline finally is exercised by the state.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.720]   And the church has not even power to excommunicate.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.960]   That's the Erastian idea,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   which is, as I explained to you,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.800]   the view of the Lutheran church
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.400]   and of the Church of England.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.640]   The next then has some relationship to the last,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.760]   but it's got to have a separate category.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.400]   It is the belief in episcopacy,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.680]   belief in government by bishops,
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.160]   the episcopal system.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.960]   Now, this teaching can be summarized like this.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.240]   It teaches that Christ himself
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.880]   has committed the government of the church
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.440]   directly to certain men, an order,
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.800]   which is called the Order of the Bench of Bishops,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.280]   who are the direct descendants and continuers
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.720]   of the apostolate.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.240]   That is the teaching,
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   that Christ appointed the apostles
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.120]   and they were to perpetuate themselves
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.000]   and their order in the appointment of these bishops.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.600]   And that government in the church
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   is to be confined solely and entirely to bishops.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.360]   Now, any episcopal church believes that.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.520]   All episcopal churches teach that.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.640]   The government is entirely in the hand
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.520]   of the episcopate, the bishops.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.280]   And the ordinary members have really no say whatsoever
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.000]   in the ordering of the life of the church.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.360]   What of this?
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.720]   Well, all I would say by way of comment is
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.800]   that the man who has thrown the greatest light upon this
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.600]   is undoubtedly the great Bishop Lightfoot,
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.760]   who was once the Bishop of Durham.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.720]   And Bishop Lightfoot has proved to the satisfaction of all
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.160]   that in the New Testament,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.520]   there is no difference whatsoever
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.160]   between the bishop and the elder.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.680]   That the terms bishop and elder or presbyter
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.920]   are interchangeable.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.200]   Now, this isn't my opinion,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.280]   that's the opinion of Bishop Lightfoot.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.760]   And you can read it in his books
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.160]   in which he deals with this matter.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.120]   For instance, you notice the Apostle Paul
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.760]   writing to the church at Philippi.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.400]   This is how he writes.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.040]   "Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.360]   "to all the saints in Christ Jesus,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.360]   "which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons."
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.760]   Bishops there stands for presbyters, stands for elders.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.840]   And you notice that in the one church at Philippi,
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   there were bishops, not only one, but several.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.440]   So that far from teaching
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.800]   that there is one bishop over a great diocese,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.600]   one bishop responsible for a large group of churches,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.640]   in the New Testament,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.520]   there are many bishops in one church.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.760]   In other words, they were not bishops
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.460]   according to our conception
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.640]   of what is meant by the word bishop at all.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.880]   They were elders, they were presbyters.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.680]   They were the older people
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.360]   to whom this position and function was given.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.160]   In other words, it seems to me,
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.840]   and I'm here happy to say that I'm in entire accord
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.320]   with the gentlemen who are called scholars,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.720]   there is no New Testament authority whatsoever
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.320]   for the episcopal view
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.360]   of the government of the Christian church.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.800]   In fact, it is known historically
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.480]   that it was an idea that came in several centuries
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.280]   after the first century, started by a man called Cyprian.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.960]   And of course, again, let me say this.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.280]   We can easily see how it came into being.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.640]   Problems would arise in the church,
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.800]   difficulties would crop up,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.200]   and there was a need felt for some kind of discipline,
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.880]   some kind of body to decide things.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   And once you start having to do something like that,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.680]   you're on the road to episcopacy.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.640]   You see, it has often been said about those of us
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.280]   who don't believe in a bench of bishops
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.840]   that we nevertheless believe in bishops,
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.480]   but that we believe in local bishops.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.800]   Now, perhaps there may be some truth in that charge
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.560]   that is proffered against us.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.360]   In other words, I'm saying that the moment
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.160]   you begin to exercise discipline,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   there is a need of some standard and some power
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   and some body that can put it into practice.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.760]   And it was only as the result of having to do that
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.440]   that this episcopal idea came into being.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.040]   And since then, of course, the Roman Catholic church
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.440]   has been a great pains to try and trace this right back,
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.640]   ultimately, to the apostle Peter.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.040]   Now, that brings me to the next view,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.960]   the Roman Catholic view.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.800]   What is that?
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.880]   Well, it's this.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.360]   It is episcopacy driven to its logical conclusion.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.360]   Let us say that for their idea.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.160]   They're absolutely logical and consistent.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.480]   If you really believe in the episcopal ordering
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.440]   of the church, well, then the logical conclusion
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.200]   is one episcopos, one bishop over all the others
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.480]   who's got final authority, who speaks ex cathedra,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.400]   who's infallible, and whose every word
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.280]   is definitely from God.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.040]   That's their claim.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.720]   They claim that the Pope is not only the chief bishop,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.920]   but that he's the direct successor to the apostle Peter
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.320]   and is therefore the vicar of Christ on earth.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.560]   We don't waste time in going into all that.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.960]   There are books with which you are no doubt familiar,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.720]   which can give you the full answer.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.600]   The main answer is this, that historically,
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.680]   they have no case whatsoever.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   Now, I'm not simply making an assertion.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.720]   It is something that can be demonstrated.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.440]   There is no historical case for their argument whatsoever.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.000]   If you want a great book on the subject,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.160]   it's called "The Infallibility of the Church"
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.080]   by a man called Salmond, S-A-L-M-O-N-D.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.120]   It's available in various libraries,
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.560]   and indeed it's recently been reprinted,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.800]   "The Infallibility of the Church" by Salmond.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.280]   And the Roman Catholics have been completely unable
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.640]   to answer his detailed arguments.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.200]   They reject it as a whole,
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.960]   but they can't answer him in detail
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.560]   because there is no answer.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   The next view of the government of the church
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.880]   is the Presbyterian.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.000]   The Presbyterian view is this.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.040]   It starts by saying that the local church in itself
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.000]   is an entity, but that for the sake of order
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.600]   and for the sake of conformity,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.440]   for the sake of avoiding chaos,
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.800]   it is well for local churches to set up a body
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.840]   which they'll all recognize and to which
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.720]   they will all conform.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.760]   So what they did was this.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.040]   A number of churches met together and formed a presbytery.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.080]   When I say a number of churches met,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.800]   the whole body of the church didn't meet,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.840]   but each local church appointed delegates,
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.320]   and the other churches did the same,
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.400]   and all these delegates met together,
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.640]   a minister and an elder, and they formed a presbytery.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.160]   And they solemnly agreed together
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.280]   that every local church would abide
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.000]   by the decision of the presbytery.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.360]   And then they went further and gathered together
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.880]   a number of presbyteries into a general assembly.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.240]   Each presbytery sends up a number of delegates,
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.560]   and these delegates constitute the general assembly.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.360]   And the presbyteries agreed to abide by the decisions
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.200]   of the Supreme Court, the general assembly.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.160]   Now that is the essence of the Presbyterian system
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.960]   that has been, for instance, the method of government
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.600]   in the church and indeed in the churches in general
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.320]   in Scotland since the time of John Knox
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.920]   and the Protestant Reformation, the Presbyterian system.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.880]   And then finally, there is the view of church government
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.680]   which we call congregational or independent.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.840]   It's rather difficult to handle this subject today
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.720]   for this reason, that not one of these descriptions
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.000]   I've been given is strictly in correspondence
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.720]   with what is actually in practice today.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.280]   Here am I now beginning to talk about
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   independency or congregationalism.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.240]   But there's very little of such a quality to be had today.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.800]   The Congregationalists, those who believe
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.120]   in the Congregational system believe this,
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:47.280]   that every local church is an entity in itself,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.240]   that it has supreme power to decide everything.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.080]   Of course, it's a gathering of Christians
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.920]   who believe that the Lord is present
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.160]   and that he is the head of the church.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.480]   And they believe that looking unto him and waiting upon him,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.440]   he by the spirit will guide them
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.000]   and give them the necessary wisdom
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.560]   in order to decide as to doctrine,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.680]   in order to decide as to discipline,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.000]   and so on and so forth.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.520]   The local church is an entity in itself,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.840]   it's autonomous, it governs itself,
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.120]   and it doesn't look to any higher body,
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.040]   whether a bench of bishops or a presbytery
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.160]   or a general assembly or anything else.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:35.080]   But as I ask, how many such churches are there today?
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.880]   Originally, you see, the description applied
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.760]   to the so-called Congregationalists and to the Baptists.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.000]   For the Baptists believe in congregational church order,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.760]   in independency from the standpoint of government.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.080]   But by today, in general, both the Congregationalists
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.040]   and the Baptists have adopted the Presbyterian idea.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.760]   With their sustentation funds
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.360]   and their control over the local church through funds,
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.400]   they are no longer Congregationalists.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.200]   They have become Presbyterian.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.120]   And there is power given to a higher body
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.240]   which can influence the local church.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.000]   But ideally and originally, in the 17th century,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.440]   Congregationalism or independency conformed to the pattern
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.600]   which I've just been describing.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.360]   Well, there, historically, you have the different views
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.760]   as to the ordering of the government of the church.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.680]   I've no doubt many are anxious
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.960]   to ask a question at this point.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.200]   And that is, do I advocate one of these rather than the other?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.840]   Well, I'm not afraid of the challenge
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.960]   and I don't resent the question.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.600]   It is the business of any man who feels called of God
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.280]   to teach, to try to give guidance.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.160]   I don't want to be over-dogmatic, but I do suggest this,
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.960]   that surely, as you think of these things
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.320]   in the light of the New Testament teaching,
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.200]   and forget what has happened in history,
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.840]   you surely must come to the conclusion
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.560]   that the local, independent conception
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.160]   is the one that is most scriptural.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.080]   Yes, the local churches, even in the New Testament times,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.880]   they did meet together for fellowship.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.440]   And surely we must do that.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.600]   All of us who are Christians desire fellowship
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.440]   with others who are Christians.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.280]   We hold the same views, we worship the same Lord.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.760]   It's good for us to meet in conference, yes.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.640]   But as I understand the teaching of the scripture,
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   there was no binding authority in any council.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.360]   Take, for instance, the council that met in Jerusalem,
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.200]   which is described in the 15th chapter
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.760]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.360]   It had no power to legislate for the local churches,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.760]   it simply sent a recommendation.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.400]   It simply said, "It seems good to us and to the Holy Ghost."
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.640]   They couldn't compel the local church, they couldn't coerce.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.240]   They said, "This is our understanding, this is our advice."
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.280]   And the local churches could either accept it or reject it.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.360]   Of course, they had power to say this,
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.960]   if a local church disagreed entirely,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.520]   well then, when they had their next fellowship meeting,
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.720]   they suggested perhaps that such a church
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.920]   should have no right to come to the fellowship.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.280]   If they were not in agreement,
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.040]   there is no longer any fellowship.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   But there was no legislative power,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.920]   there was no coercive power.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.360]   And that is why I do suggest to you
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:41.000]   that that seems to me to be the closest in approximation
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.960]   to the New Testament pattern.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   Each local church, autonomous, independent,
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   but ready always to meet in fellowship
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   with those who are like-minded and of a like spirit.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   Because, my friends, if you don't do that,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   and if you adopt any one of the other systems,
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   this is what you have eventually.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   You will find yourself an evangelical member of a body
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   in which the controlling powers don't agree with you
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   in doctrine or in practice.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.960]   And yet you are expected to support financially
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.960]   a teaching which you believe to be wrong and dangerous
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   simply because you belong to such a body.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   Now that is what has invariably happened in history.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   And that is the position of so many evangelical people today.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.960]   They belong to churches which in the mass and the main,
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   they not only do not agree with,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   but they're not in sympathy with.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   And yet they are subject to such powers.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   An evangelical clergyman, for instance,
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   may have a high church, extreme anglo-catholic,
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   to confirm his own members
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   and to do other things in the realm of the church.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   Or an evangelical may find himself in a free church
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   supporting funds to maintain ministers and ministries
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   which he verily believes is a denial of the faith.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   And yet, you see, if you belong to the system,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.960]   you can't very well avoid doing that.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.960]   Well, therefore, I say,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   in the light of the New Testament teaching,
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.960]   and surely in the light of experience throughout the centuries also,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   it seems to me the ideal is the local church,
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   the people who are agreed,
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.960]   and in fellowship with all others who are similarly agreed,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   but nothing binding,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   no coercive power,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   no right to impose anything from above,
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   no right to bind the conscience.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   But this fellowship of like-minded believers
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   meeting together to further themselves and their spiritual life,
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   to help one another as best they can,
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   but freely, voluntarily,
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   without being tied and ultimately compelled
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.960]   to do the things which are contrary to their views
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.960]   and indeed even contrary to their conscience.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   Well, there is some conception of the teaching
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   with respect to the government or the ordering of the life of the church.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.960]   Next week, God willing,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   I hope to go on to consider the means of grace and the sacraments,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.960]   how the church exercises the second mark,
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   which is the true and the right administration of the sacraments.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   I do trust that there is nobody present
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   who feels that this has not been a spiritual evening.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   My dear friends, these things are to me of vital importance,
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   as I said at the beginning,
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   and if you say, "Oh, the government of the church has got nothing to do with me.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   I'm a spiritually-minded person,"
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.960]   the only thing I have to say to you is that you're a very unscriptural person,
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.960]   and that as a member of the body of Christ,
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   it is your business, it is your duty,
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   to see to it that the church visible
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   in no way contradicts the doctrine of the Lord himself
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   and of which he has made us custodians and guardians.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   Let us pray.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   We pray thy forgiveness, our heavenly Father,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.960]   that so often through indolence or lack of concern
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   we have failed to interest ourselves in the teaching of thy word
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   concerning these matters that we have considered together.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.960]   Oh, God, have mercy and have pity upon us,
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   and oh, pardon us, we pray thee,
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   if as the result of our failure
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   any discredit or dishonor has been brought to thy great and holy name.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   Oh, Lord, our God, we beseech thee,
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   grant unto us all humility,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   grant us all to remember how fallible we are.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   Deliver us, we pray thee, from being bound by anything
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   save a desire that thy name may be glorified
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.960]   and that in all things we do indeed conform
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   to the teaching of thy word.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   Now grant us, we pray thee, thy blessing,
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   and follow us upon our several ways,
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   and may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.960]   and the love of God
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   abide and continue with us now and evermore.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   Amen.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
