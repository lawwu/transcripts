[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   On Wednesday, we looked at our greatest joy.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   What could make you happy forever?
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.400]   The surest and most stable answer to this question is found in the Bible in four representative
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.400]   texts.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.240]   Those were Psalm 40, verse 16; Psalm 70, verse 4; Romans 5, 11; and 1 Peter 3, 18.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.660]   We looked at those passages last time, and they get mentioned a lot on this podcast to
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.760]   make one precious point.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.400]   God himself is the prize of the gospel.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.660]   But even as God is the prize of the gospel, he daily lavishes on us all sorts of other
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.060]   created gifts that are good and lawful and should be embraced with thanksgiving.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.160]   But handling such gifts is not without challenges for all of us, and particularly for Jameson,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760]   a podcast listener with today's question.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.040]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.560]   Here's my question for you today.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.120]   I have Christian friends who believe that alcohol and drugs, particularly pot, are morally
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   good things to be received in the spirit of what Paul says in 1 Timothy 4.4.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.680]   For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.880]   with thanksgiving.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   But I know Paul also says that all things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.640]   All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.320]   That's 1 Corinthians 10.23.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.040]   I'm trying to figure out what we can thank God for and what we cannot thank him for.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.320]   Number one, can we thank God for a substance that is illegal for us, say underage drinking
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.000]   or recreational pot, where it breaks the law?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.320]   And two, does Paul imply that we can thank God for anything that is lawful for us, but
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.880]   not helpful to us?
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.960]   I guess I'm asking, in what ways would you qualify Paul's "nothing is to be rejected"?
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.780]   When my friend attempts to thank God for the pot that I don't think benefits his life and
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.760]   which is illegal for him to use, I am troubled.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.560]   Right, you should be troubled.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.360]   I'm glad Jameson got to the point where he said, "I guess what I'm asking is, in what
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.280]   ways would you qualify Paul's 'nothing is to be rejected'?"
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.560]   Because that is really the issue.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.480]   The issue is not, "What can I give thanks for?"
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.000]   Paul teaches that we should give thanks for everything.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.280]   Doesn't help his case at all, right?
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.120]   Ephesians 5.20, "Give thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.960]   the Lord Jesus."
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.000]   But that does not mean give moral approval to everything.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   It means, rather, that we recognize that in the providence of God, he makes everything
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   serve his wise and loving purposes, even some very painful and even sinful things.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.040]   So I don't think the key question is, "What should we thank God for?"
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   And Paul said in 1 Timothy 4.4, "Everything created by God is good, and nothing is to
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.800]   be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving."
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.280]   He's saying that's why everything exists, namely, to reveal the goodness of God and
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.440]   to awaken in the human soul thanksgiving.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.960]   In other words, we should only use creation, all of it, the way it was designed to be used,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.400]   namely with thanksgiving.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.720]   So Jameson says the real question is, and he's right, I think, certainly the question
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.960]   that exercises me, "What does Paul mean when he says nothing in creation is to be
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.720]   rejected?"
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.960]   And I think he means nothing is to be rejected because it is ritually unclean.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.280]   According to Mark 7.19, Jesus declared all foods clean.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.920]   So they're all lawful, not to be rejected.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.820]   None of the Old Testament dietary laws applies anymore.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.520]   They were a temporary way for Israel to set itself off from the nations.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.880]   The church doesn't aim to set itself off from the nations in that way anymore.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.480]   With food laws, nothing is ritually unclean for the Christian.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.640]   In that sense, it's lawful, it's all lawful.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:59.080]   None is to be rejected as ritually off-limits, which also means that the false teachers in
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.040]   1 Timothy 4 who were forbidding marriage and requiring abstinence from foods were falling
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.360]   back into the old legal way rather than walking in the freedom of Christ.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   But to say that nothing is to be rejected as ritually unclean does not mean that all
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:31.280]   is to be eaten or drunk, even with Thanksgiving, because there are other factors to take into
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.420]   account, which Paul doesn't mention here because they're not the issue with the false
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.600]   teachers in 1 Timothy.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.240]   But Jameson is right that he should bring in Paul's principles from 1 Corinthians because
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   they are relevant as to what we shall reject or not reject.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.320]   And I think there are at least three principles that Paul mentions as to what do we do with
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.040]   nature, the goodness of nature.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.120]   One principle is love, 1 Corinthians 10, 23.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.800]   All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.240]   All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.160]   Let no one seek his own good but the good of his neighbor.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.280]   So we do not simply say, "I'm free, and all foods are clean, and that's that.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.880]   I eat what I want."
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.800]   No, that's not the way a Christian talks.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.840]   We ask, "Will it be helpful?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.960]   Will it be profitable?
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.720]   Will other people benefit from my enjoyment of this use of this, doing of this?"
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.400]   That's the principle of love.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.640]   And then in 1 Corinthians 6, 12, he brings out two other principles, I think.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   He says, "All things are lawful for me," same beginning, but he continues differently.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.320]   But not all things are helpful.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   All things are lawful for me, but I will not be dominated, controlled, taken over, enslaved
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.160]   by anything, even good things.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.920]   Here the principle looks the same as 1 Corinthians 10, but it's not quite.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   Instead of saying, "Seek the good of your neighbor in what you eat," he says, "I
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.680]   will not be dominated or enslaved by anything."
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.840]   You might say this is the principle of self-love, a proper self-love.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.560]   Be watchful not to be addicted.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.080]   Be watchful not to be damaged.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.560]   I think those would be the two principles.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.640]   Is it tending toward my slavery, making me a slave?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.080]   I'm out of control here.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.960]   I'm utterly dependent on this thing.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.280]   And is it hurting me?
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.520]   Is it doing me damage as my master?
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:17.360]   So three principles at least put limits on the statement, "Nothing is to be rejected."
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.240]   One, love.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.640]   Will it help or hurt others?
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.000]   Two, addiction.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Will I be enslaved?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.080]   Is it enslaving me?
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.560]   Three, damage to my body or soul.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.320]   Will it dominate me hurtfully?
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:44.760]   But maybe the clearest way to show Jameson's friends that they don't really mean it when
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.320]   they say that since everything that God made is good, absolutely nothing is to be rejected.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.160]   They don't mean that because they know good and well that there are mushrooms that will
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.880]   kill you if you eat them.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.600]   There are some people with such severe peanut allergies, they would die.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.000]   They would die if they eat a peanut.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.400]   They wouldn't even let you have peanuts on the airplane when these people are on board.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.320]   They don't serve peanuts.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.640]   They know this.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.680]   These friends know this.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.420]   They make distinctions themselves.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.320]   So the question is whether cannabis is helpful to others when we use it.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   Is it addicting to my mind?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.360]   Is it hurtful to the mind or to the soul?
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   Those are the key questions.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:37.320]   And it might help to close by me just doing a little memory exercise here.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:46.440]   When I came to Bethlehem Baptist Church 43 years ago as pastor, the church covenant said
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:59.120]   this, "We engage to abstain from the use and sale of alcoholic beverages," which meant
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.880]   that teetotalism was required for church membership.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:16.120]   Now, I told the leaders when I came, "That is seriously unbiblical," even though I myself
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:24.440]   see good reasons in our culture and our day with my personality for being a teetotaler.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.260]   That's not a biblical requirement for church membership.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.280]   So how did we change it?
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   We did.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.320]   It almost cost me my job in the second year I was there, but the vote passed and I survived.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.600]   How did we change the covenant?
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.360]   We made it more radical.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.000]   And here's the present wording.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   We engage to seek God's help in abstaining from all drugs, food, drink, and practices
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   which bring unwarranted harm to the body or jeopardize our own or another's faith.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.400]   So not just alcohol or cannabis or whatever, but all drugs, all food, all drink, all practices.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:20.040]   And the way we test what we eat or drink or do is does it bring unwarranted harm to the
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.840]   body or does it jeopardize our own or another's faith?
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   And I think that's a good application of Paul's principles in the New Testament.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.040]   Will it enslave and damage or will it help and love?
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.240]   Really good categories to keep in mind.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.600]   We talked directly about whether or not drinking alcohol is a sin.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   That was in APJ 200.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   200.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   Wow.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   You can check that out.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.000]   That's a long time ago.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.240]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:01.360]   You can find APJ 200 or subscribe to the podcast all at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   Well in 1 Timothy 4.1, Paul says, "Some professing Christians will depart from the faith and
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.600]   give themselves over to the teachings of demons."
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.920]   Wow.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:22.560]   So how blatant or how subtle is such a move moving from orthodoxy to demon theology?
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.680]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we will Ask Pastor John on Monday.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.000]   See you then.
