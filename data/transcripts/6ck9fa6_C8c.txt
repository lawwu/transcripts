[00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.960]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.760]   My guest today is Dr. Carolina Westland.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.380]   Dr. Carolina Westland is an animal ethologist
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.400]   and expert in animal behavior.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.440]   Dr. Westland and I discussed the relationship
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.040]   between humans and domesticated animals,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.320]   with a focus on the evidence-based protocols
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.680]   for optimizing the mental and physical health of our pets.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.360]   Dr. Westland explains the best way
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.040]   to interact with our animals.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.080]   Now, we may assume that the way we pet our animals
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.280]   and exercise them and feed them makes them truly happy.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.120]   But as she points out,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.800]   many of the things that people assume turn out to be false
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.860]   when it comes to our pets and their fundamental drives.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.480]   She teaches us the very basic
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.720]   but powerful things that we can do to satisfy those drives,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.320]   both for the animal's sake, of course,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.740]   and to better our relationship with them.
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.640]   We also discuss the unique neurological
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.440]   and physiological requirements of different dog breeds.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.400]   That's a fascinating conversation that stems
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.160]   from their lineage from wolves.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.240]   And we'll tell you whether or not your particular breed,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.600]   even if it's a mutt, should be exercised in a particular way,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.800]   whether or not it needs additional forms of stimulation
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.960]   that you're not currently giving it, and so on.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   And because we both realize there are also cat owners
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.400]   out there too, we discuss the often misunderstood
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.520]   communication signals and social needs of cats.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.040]   As you may know, there is a tremendous amount of debate
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.680]   out there about the best training and practices
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.960]   for taking care of our dogs and other animals.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.520]   And so much of that is grounded in speculation
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.280]   and training outcomes, which of course are important.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.720]   The conversation today with Dr. Westland approaches animal
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.080]   health and welfare through the lens of ethology
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.280]   and the species that our pets evolved from
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.400]   to provide actionable protocols that are grounded in science
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.800]   and that you can implement right away to improve your pet's wellbeing.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.760]   So if you're a pet owner, this episode is going to be of immense value to you.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.080]   If you're not a pet owner, you'll still learn a ton about animal biology
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.440]   and psychology, including yours.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.040]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.800]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.560]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.720]   to consumer information about science and science related tools
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.040]   to the general public.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.640]   In keeping with that theme, this episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.040]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Carolina Westland.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.840]   Dr. Carolina Westland, welcome.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.720]   I'm super excited for this conversation.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.600]   Yeah, me too.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.800]   And barely contained myself.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.480]   I think we have so much to learn from animals.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.280]   And I think we have so much to learn from our relationship to animals.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.600]   I also believe that we have all sorts of ideas about what animals experience,
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.760]   what they think about us, the relationship that we think we have with them.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.360]   Today, you're going to set the record straight.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.920]   To start off, could you just briefly list off some of the species of animals
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   that your students have worked with and studied?
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.520]   Most of my students are like guardians of animals.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.040]   So they're like dog owners or horse trainers, or there might be veterinarians.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   Some of them work in a zoo as a zookeeper or animal trainer and so on.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.040]   So my students are really diverse and their knowledge levels is also really diverse
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.640]   from the sort of person who has their first dog at the age of 40 to somebody who's been
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   training animals for 30 years.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.160]   I grew up around a few horse people.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:38.280]   My first girlfriend had a horse and it was remarkable to me to see and to get some just external
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.160]   understanding of the relationship between human and animal through observing that.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   I think of all the relationships between animals and humans, the horse-human relationship seems
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   to be the one where there's the most amount of physical contact, right?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.360]   You learn to ride a horse.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   You learn to read the horse's intentions.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   It learns to read yours through these subtle, you know, squeezing of the legs or you're kicking
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   or not kicking hard, but you know, like just like a nudge of the heel, just a slight tug on the reins.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   It's really remarkable.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:22.720]   Um, what does the horse experience the world as we, I've heard before that, you know, that they
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.520]   sort of have these orbs of, of awareness around them and that they're paying attention to things
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080]   on the horizon, that they're, um, clearly paying attention to things very up close to their body.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.120]   But if you were to put us into the mind of a horse, uh, as best you can, how does the horse experience
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.600]   the world as a wild horse and with a rider on its back, trying to steer it in a particular
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.120]   direction at a particular speed?
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.200]   As an ethologist, I, I tend to take a step back and look at sort of, um, the, the species
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:02.960]   in general and horses are prey animals, they are also herd animals, and I think that, um, we,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.840]   as humans, we tend to not really understand how different animal species can be from ourselves
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.520]   in how they perceive the world and what's important to them. Uh, so horses being prey animals means
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.360]   that they're usually quite vigilant. So they're paying a lot of attention to the world. And they
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.160]   have this, the vision, their visual field is really big, so they can sort of see what's happening
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.880]   back there. The issue I have with how we raise and keep horses today as an ethologist and sort
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.960]   of looking at how animals live their lives in the wild is that we keep them in a way that sort of
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.720]   challenges them in several aspects of that. So we tend to separate them quite early from their mum,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.120]   even though in the wild they would stay for a very long time. So I think some of the concerns that I
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.240]   have as an ethologist with how we raise horses is the, the, the early weaning that we sometimes see
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.480]   and also single housing for a species that's, um, an aggregating species. And also that they,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.040]   uh, in the wild they will forage up to 16 hours a day. And when we bring them into captivity,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.880]   we typically feed them in the way that promotes very quick eating, you know, for just a fraction of that
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.840]   time. And that can then lead to problem behavior. So, so for me, I think the horses are probably one of
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:34.560]   the captive animal species where for many individual horses, the type of life that we're offering is
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:44.800]   really not that great. Interesting. Dogs I know are very, uh, smell oriented. They experience the world,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.920]   um, perhaps largely, um, perhaps largely, but certainly, uh, quite a bit through their noses.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:57.120]   Um, they can sense odor instead of distance and certainly up close, they like to get their nose
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.600]   right into things and, and, and sniff, get deep sniffs. Um, and they're always collecting information with their noses.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:11.200]   There's a huge range of dog breeds. And I think any discussion about dogs requires that we, uh,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.080]   first kind of separate out some of the major differences, um, at least in terms of the purebred
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:24.880]   versions of them. When I see a mastiff versus a chihuahua, uh, versus a, like a scent hound,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.480]   I'm looking at to me, what appear to be very different animals. Is it true that certain
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.000]   dogs rely on their sense of smell far more than others? And if so, um, do the ones that rely on
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.600]   their, on their nose, uh, just not pay attention to what they're looking at unless you insist? I mean,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.120]   that the other version of this question is how should we interact with dogs differently depending
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.000]   on what breed of dog they are? Yeah. So I think I can't really answer the first part of that
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.800]   question. I don't know the extent to which, uh, different dog breeds, uh, their, their sensory
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.920]   capabilities, how, how much that differs between different dog breeds. However, um, how to interact
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.480]   with different dog breeds. I think that's really a really interesting question because, so during the
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.160]   process of domestication and, and in just the last couple of hundred years, really, we started selecting
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:28.080]   for different capabilities in the different dog, um, dogs that, that we needed for different tasks,
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:35.040]   essentially. So if we look at a wolf hunting sequence, what they'll do is they'll do an orient
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:42.000]   response where they, they sniff and they, they're sort of looking for a, uh, prey and then they will
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.960]   do some eyeing and stalking behavior. So they'll focus and they'll do stalking and then they'll do
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:54.160]   chasing and then they'll do a grab bite, a killing bite, then they'll dissect and then they'll eat the
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.760]   prey. So we have this whole predatory sequence that we see in wolves. And what happened during the process
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.600]   of domestication was that we sort of selected for certain aspects of that sequence in different
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:12.640]   breeds. So we'll have the, the sniffers, the hounds that are really great. And I, I guess maybe that
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.040]   answers your first question. I think that probably all dog breeds enjoy sniffing. It's one of the big
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:26.000]   things that people are exploring a lot now is, is nose work. But anyway, back to, to the, this process of
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   domestication that, and then we had the, um, uh, the, the pointers who are, who sort of, we have
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.000]   really, uh, uh, selected for that behavior, you know, that in, in, in a, in a litter of puppies,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.880]   we would select the one that was the most prone to do that behavior. And so over generations, we really,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:58.160]   um, sculpted that, that, uh, niche, so to speak. So a, a pointer will typically not proceed to the,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.600]   to the next behavior of the predatory sequence. And then we have like the border collies who might do
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.840]   some chasing, uh, or some, some, um, eyeing and stalking and a little bit of chase, but ideally no
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:17.200]   grabbing. And we have the pure chasers, the greyhounds for instance. And then we have the, the grabbers, the, uh,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.240]   the retrievers. And then we have the killers, uh, um, the terriers.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.800]   People, I, I'm assuming we're anticipating you to say the pit bulls or the Dobermans, but, uh,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.840]   anyone that's owned a terrier will know that they are great, uh, ratting dogs.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.800]   They were bred to, to, uh, exterminate, uh, small, like rodents and stuff.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.520]   Yeah. Anyone who's seen a Westie, those cute little, uh, West Highland terriers, the little white ones,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.400]   they're real cute. If, if one of those hears or senses a rodent in the wall, I've seen one stalk one for
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:58.080]   several days that will move along. We used to call it rat TV. Yeah. The, um, Westie will sense where,
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.040]   when and where the rodent is there with an absolute fixation. And if there's any way to get into that
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.600]   wall and kill that rodent, it's coming out with that rodent in its mouth. Yeah. It's remarkable. Yeah.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   The amount of dedication is just striking and it's all about killing that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so we,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:20.240]   we systematically intentionally bred for that like a couple of hundred years ago. And then
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.480]   we have the, the ones that don't show much of the predatory sequence at all that simply mostly just
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.680]   eat, uh, which are, are the, um, what do you call them? Uh, the ones that, that, um, help, uh, livestock
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.720]   guardians. They, they still like the sniffing. So they tend to retain the sniffing part and then
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:51.520]   specific breeds will have one or perhaps a few of the behaviors from the, from the hunting sequence. Um,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:12:02.800]   so I think if we want to offer, uh, dogs a good, um, a good life, we should understand where they are on
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   that scale. And also that the working dogs come sort of with this evolutionary backpack, their genetic
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:19.280]   backpack will, will, uh, encourage them to really want to do that work. And then we have the, also the,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.040]   the sort of, um, I think they're sometimes referred to as toy breeds, the ones that, the lap dogs who are not
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:36.000]   that interested in, in any of that, that working dog, uh, behavior. So I think it's, we need to, uh,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.080]   with regards to the different breeds, we need to really understand what purpose they were bred for.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.680]   I think. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, Our Place. Our Place
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.360]   makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware. Surprisingly, toxic compounds such as PFASs or
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.960]   forever chemicals are still found in 80% of nonstick pans, as well as utensils, appliances,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.000]   and countless other kitchen products. As I've discussed before in this podcast, these PFASs or
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.800]   forever chemicals like Teflon have been linked to major health issues such as hormone disruption,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.760]   gut microbiome disruption, fertility issues, and many other health problems. So it's really
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.720]   important to try and avoid them. This is why I'm a huge fan of Our Place. Our Place products are made
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.080]   with the highest quality materials and are all completely PFAS and toxin-free. I especially love
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.320]   their Titanium Always Pan Pro. It's the first nonstick pan made with zero chemicals and zero coating.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.840]   Instead, it uses pure titanium. This means it has no harmful forever chemicals and does not degrade
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.800]   or lose its nonstick effect over time. It's also beautiful to look at. I cook eggs in my Titanium
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.840]   Always Pan Pro almost every morning. The design allows for the eggs to cook perfectly without
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.040]   sticking to the pan. I also cook burgers and steaks in it and it puts a really nice sear on the meat.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.120]   But again, nothing sticks to it so it's really easy to clean and it's even dishwasher safe.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.560]   I love it and I basically use it constantly. Our Place now has a full line of Titanium Pro cookware
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.520]   that uses its first of its kind titanium nonstick technology. So if you're looking for non-toxic

[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.800]   with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. Now, I've spoken before on this podcast about the
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.280]   critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each and every night. Now, one of
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to ensure that the temperature of your sleeping
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.640]   environment is correct. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.600]   actually has to drop about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.560]   your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees. Eight Sleep automatically
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.960]   regulates the temperature of your bed throughout the night according to your unique needs. Now,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.760]   I find that extremely useful because I like to make the bed really cool at the beginning of the night,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.400]   even colder in the middle of the night and warm as I wake up. That's what gives me the most
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.480]   slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. And I know that because Eight Sleep has a great sleep
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.640]   tracker that tells me how well I've slept and the types of sleep that I'm getting throughout the
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.360]   night. I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for four years now, and it has completely
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.120]   transformed and improved the quality of my sleep. Their latest model, the Pod 4 Ultra, also has snoring
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.000]   detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees in order to improve your airflow and stop you
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.200]   from snoring. If you decide to try Eight Sleep, you have 30 days to try it at home and you can return it if you don't
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.040]   like it. No questions asked, but I'm sure that you'll love it. Go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman to save up to

[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.160]   That's a beautiful and, to me, completely novel description of the breakdown of different breeds,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:24.080]   not according to the dosing of wolf versus mastiff genes, which is what some of the more reductionist
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.920]   research papers on this really do. They have these charts. We'll provide a link to one that was published
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.600]   in Science Magazine about 10 years back that had this sort of dosing of mastiff genes versus
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:45.440]   wolf genes. And what you just described beautifully breaks down what one observes if you go to a dog park
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.280]   or the beach. My bulldog mastiff, Costello, he was a mudded bulldog. So I always say,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.040]   you know, no underbite. So it wasn't this, it was this, right? So a proper bulldog before they inbred
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.760]   them so much that they have the underbite and the short snout, the brachycephalic, the breathing issues.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:13.120]   But he neither stalked nor chased, nor was he interested in killing anything. He didn't
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.600]   have that sense to try and harm, but he certainly liked to consume. So he was at the end of that
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   behavioral description. And what were they bred for?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.520]   So I'll try and not take up too much time on this one, because I want to learn from you. The original
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:37.280]   bulldog line was a cross between a mastiff, something like a mastiff, a strong, large,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:46.320]   high pain tolerance, and a pug, short snout. And the gene cross there, and obviously the dog geneticists
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.640]   weren't thinking about specific genes, they were thinking about traits, was the short snout was
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.920]   great for what's called bull baiting, because that short snout provides the kind of lever that when they
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:02.160]   bite down onto the nose of a bull, which is what they were used for. It was a cruel practice. Very
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.200]   hard to shake them loose. The bull could shake them and they're not going to shake loose. Just think
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.520]   about trying to pick something up with long tongs, right? The physics of this versus a clamp,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.480]   right? Like a C clamp.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.160]   The mutation that takes the pain receptors out of the face, or reduces them,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:24.400]   is close by another gene that is involved in generating the tensile nature of the skin. So this
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.080]   is why they have the jowls, the folds. And you can, I don't suggest anyone do this, but Costello,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.400]   I'll just give an example. Sometimes, unfortunately, would like get a fish hook through his jowl when
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.520]   he was playing at the ocean or something. And he'd come up to me bleeding, smiling, you know,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   basically you have to take this thing out.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.200]   So his pain tolerance was quite high.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.160]   Pain tolerance was very high in the front of the animal, in the face, and toward the rear of the
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.640]   animal, you touch his back toe. And it's, you know, so they have a gradient of pain receptors that runs
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.400]   high density in the back, low density to the front. So they were bred for bull baiting.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:03.280]   And the original line has been bred out. It's people who care about the bulldog breed,
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.360]   and bringing some more humane breeding practices to the bulldog, because it's a pretty brutal breed now,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:16.640]   have tried to reestablish the original line, which again, were elbows back, no strong underbite,
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   as opposed to what you see now. So that's the sort of brief history on the bulldog. They have to be born
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:30.240]   by cesarean, because big shoulders, small hips. Anyway, the interesting thing about the bulldog, I always
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:38.400]   said, and this will take us back to behavior, was the contract that I felt I had with my bulldog was one of
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.640]   he would protect me to the death. You do notice that anytime they hear a noise or anything, they're
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:52.880]   hypervigilant. But if there's no impending threat, total relaxation. The most efficient use of energy of
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.520]   any species. So basically it was, I'll die for you, Andrew, but unless your life is in danger, I'm not
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.600]   going to do anything. So maybe we could talk about temperament in dogs, and how they experience
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.160]   their emotional life. I don't know if we can make general statements about this, but you've spent a
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:20.240]   lot of your time thinking about the emotional life of animals. What does a dog need in order to feel
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:28.320]   calm and safe? Great question. Yeah. So in order to feel calm and safe,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:39.280]   I think we, perhaps we should go to the core effect space, which I think is one of the three
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:48.960]   emotional models that I find very, very useful in understanding and providing like a good environment
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   for animals so that they can thrive really. So the core effect space is one way of depicting or
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.880]   conceptualizing emotions where we have like valence on the x-axis. So how pleasant or unpleasant
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.640]   something is, and we have arousal on the y-axis. So what you're asking is how can we
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   make animals, and I'm not just, not just dogs, but any species, how can we put them in quadrant two of
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   that core effect space, essentially. So low arousal and pleasant. So where they're relaxed and they're
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:29.360]   feeling safe and they're sort of engaging socially with others and being sort of at ease, if you will.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.040]   So how do we get there? And I think that some of the things to consider is then the absence
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:42.720]   of negative emotions. So if, again, if we're in the core effect space in the quadrant four,
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:51.920]   with the high arousal unpleasant states, we'll find things like fear, aggression. So helping reduce that
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:22:01.120]   will sort of automatically help animals move to the right in the matrix. And in the lower quadrant three,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.160]   with the unpleasant low arousal state, where animals tend to end up with their sort of
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:16.080]   bored or depressed, is engaging them, providing an environment that's stimulating that they can
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.080]   sort of do interesting things in to help them move into the right side of the core effect space.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:32.480]   And also to the top in that quadrant one is the high arousal pleasant state. But that would be like
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:41.440]   seeking or foraging behavior, exploration, play, sex. But as to your question, how do we get into
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:48.480]   quadrant two with feeling safe and sort of that warm, fuzzy feeling?
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.400]   So some of the things to do might be to, if the animal enjoys it coming from you, and they often
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:03.120]   have to know you in order to really appreciate it, is like tactile stimulation, so petting, essentially.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   Something that might interfere is that we primates, we humans are primates and we're huggers. We tend to
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.200]   sort of go like this when we want to interact with an animal that we really like. And to many animals,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.160]   this is restraint and really scary. And so
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:27.600]   the type of body contact with that we offer to animals that we should consider whether they really
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:34.080]   enjoy it or not, whether they tolerate it or enjoy it. And one way of doing that is to offer a consent
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.840]   test. So you might, you might offer your hand and scratch a little bit, ideally in a place that the
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.720]   animal really enjoys. So most dogs don't enjoy having a hand on top of their head, but rather,
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.800]   perhaps here, or the upper chest sort of, yeah. So you might do that for a few seconds and then
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.560]   you remove your hand to see, does the animal enjoy this? And will they then re-initiate that contact
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:03.600]   or not? Or will they move away? And I have, I have this issue with my cat now that he is not very,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:11.440]   he doesn't sort of enjoy petting as much as I do petting him. So I have to be really mindful
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.920]   that I, I really offer him the chance to say, no, thanks.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:20.240]   So we might consider just touching the animal as a, you calling it a consent test, like as a,
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:28.000]   as a test. And then if they move toward you, then what is the pattern of, of tactile stimulation that's,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.640]   that dogs like? I've been reading up on this a little bit and somebody ran an experiment that I think
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.280]   is kind of interesting describing the differences between rates of petting. And it basically,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:47.120]   the conclusion was that essentially they claim that all dogs are averse to very rapid touch and,
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.560]   but that people tend to pat quickly, pet quickly. And they, they showed a beautiful example of
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:00.080]   just, just if one just deliberately strokes the animal very slowly, the animal's eyelids just
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:06.640]   start to hood. And you basically just, um, diffuse the tension very quickly, which I think is
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.320]   interesting that, you know, as humans, we think, oh, we want to pat the dog on its head. And for some
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.160]   reason we associate patting with fast patting or petting as a, as a quick process, you're going to
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.640]   scratch and pet this animal where it very well could be that all the dogs out there are just
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.560]   dying for some really nice, slow strokes. Yeah. And I also think that that nice, slow stroke,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:33.440]   if you're sort of in a calm emotional state yourself, then we might tap into another interesting, uh,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   emotion theory, which is the polyvagal theory and this concept of co-regulation. So if you're really
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:50.000]   calm and relaxed, then you're sort of sending out these cues, these, um, uh, subtle cues that other
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   individuals are reading and picking up on. And it seems that we do that with vis-a-vis also
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:05.440]   our dogs and, uh, certainly also horses, it seems so that just being calm and relaxed yourself can really
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:12.400]   help relax the dog. And what you say about the fast petting or patting really makes sense to me.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.000]   I know there's one study in horses that show that, that if you pat a horse, many horses find that
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.920]   aversive. So in other words, it's something that they'll work to avoid. And yet that is often how we
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:31.920]   try to reward them when they do something that we want. They do enjoy wither scratching. So back at the
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:38.400]   nape of the, um, the mane, if you scratch them there, they'll typically enjoy that. But I would say that,
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:46.640]   that, um, different animals, different individuals will have these individual preferences and just
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.400]   trying to see what they like. And perhaps also if you, if you offering your hands like this,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.960]   they might even scoot around to show you which body part they want scratched once they learn this,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:03.440]   this, this, the, the rules of that communication. I feel like dogs want the part of their body scratched
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.160]   that, uh, they can't access on their own. Yes. Like I'm yet to meet a dog that doesn't like being
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.760]   scratched on its rump. Bump scratching is a big thing for many animals. Yeah. Yeah. Like just like,
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.960]   like the top side of their back leg. Yeah. Right. Like right there. Yeah. It's got to feel so good. Yeah.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:28.560]   Because they can't get to that. Um, as well as underneath their rear leg, right? Like just kind
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:36.880]   of in the crook of the rear leg, um, with that, that soft skin there, right? That, um, but you know,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:44.720]   having interacted with dogs that were more skittish versus more calm, um, I totally agree that different
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:50.960]   animals, regardless of breed, um, just have a completely different relationship to, to touch.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.160]   Yeah. And, and how quickly they want to interact. I've heard, and I don't know if it's true that for
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:03.520]   dogs, space is a big thing. Um, I don't know if this is true. I'm sure, uh, someone will, um,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.560]   refute this, but the idea that, you know, if your dog runs up to you when you walk in or to,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.880]   you know, dog runs up to you and it's a new dog, you're just meeting and they touch you or they jump up on
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.640]   your shin that it's a, that it's their attempt to dominate you. Like this is my space. I'm controlling
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.440]   you that because you wouldn't necessarily walk up to a dog that you just met and just get right in
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.560]   their space without kind of them approaching you as well. What are your thoughts on this whole dominant
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.200]   submission thing on the basis of touch and space? That's like Pandora's box there, right there.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.440]   Great. I don't have any, uh, you know, stake in this. I just would like to learn and I would like
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.760]   people to learn so that they can have better interactions with, with and for animals.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.360]   Sure. Yeah. So first of all, I think that, that actually, we often do walk up to strange
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   dogs that we never met before. We're like, hi, can I pet him? And then we start patting on,
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.200]   on top of the animal's head. Guilty. Guilty.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.040]   So I think that we do do that. And then this whole discussion about dominance is really interesting
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.640]   because as an ethologist, how we define dominance is completely different from how
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:13.760]   most people define it. And I actually, I looked into the encyclopedia to see how is dominance defined
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.400]   there. And I find that there's two, like two lines of that definition. So one is the ethological
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.160]   definition of dominance and one is the sociological definition of dominance. And I think that what we're
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.960]   doing often is that we're misusing, we're, we're using the sociological definition
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:38.000]   on animals, um, in a way that's, I think, unfortunate because the ethological definition
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.760]   is about priority of access to resources. Here's a resource. Here's like five individuals coming
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.240]   up to it. There's just one there. The dominant individual will have priority of access to that
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:56.720]   resource. The others simply have to wait or look elsewhere. Uh, and this reduces the risk of sort of
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.120]   confrontation and aggression and all the costs associated with that. So it's, it's just, it's
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:08.000]   normal that animals who hang out together, who are like in a stable social group will organize or,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.320]   or have some sort of, uh, dominance hierarchy within them that, that allows this to take place,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:20.240]   to reduce the risk, the risk of aggression. Uh, it tends to become exacerbated in captivity
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   compared to, uh, in, in wild contexts, because then the animals can disperse and there's like,
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.800]   there's a resource over there that they can go and get instead. But when we house them,
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:40.000]   uh, and we're offering, uh, specifically, we're offering like, here's, you have two cats or three
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.680]   cats and now here, here's the food. You're, you're putting the animals in conflict because cats are
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.720]   solitary hunters. So they actually do prefer, if you have several cats, you should feed them
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.800]   in a sort of separate locations to reduce that sort of heightened arousal that goes with that type of
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.040]   feeling. Okay. There's dominance among dogs or among dogs and other non-human animals. I'm thinking in
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:11.440]   terms of the relationship between human and dog, um, and touch and space. You know, I've heard that,
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.360]   um, the dog touches you. It thinks it owns you. I've heard that if you move into a space,
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.680]   um, that the dog is and it backs away, then it's, uh, you know, it thinks of you as dominant. Um,
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.480]   I've also heard that if the dog moves into your space very quickly, that it sees itself as kind
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.600]   of the leader in this relationship. There are a lot of theories out there about this. And I'm realizing
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:39.840]   that all these theories about animals, um, must be very contentious because, um, they lack
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:45.680]   lack the language to tell us what we want to know. And so we're, we're always sort of guessing when
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.240]   we're doing ethology. I would not label any of those situations that you described as a dominance
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.440]   interaction, actually. I would rather, if the dog backs away when you confront them, I would sort of
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:02.880]   rather label that as perhaps a fearful reaction, uh, not submissive as in giving you priority of access
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:10.320]   to a resource. Typically feral dogs in the wild will form linear dominance hierarchies with regards
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:17.040]   to the access to resources. And that, that might shift depending on what the resource is. So it's not
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.360]   like it's, it's written in stone or anything. So it's, it's like fluid and variable, but there's still
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:30.960]   typically some sort of like, uh, hierarchy when it comes to the priority of access to resources.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:38.640]   Then we have another social role, which is the role as a leader. And when I, as an ethologist say
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:48.480]   leader, I mean the one that leads that, that sort of work walks first in line from one location to
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.280]   another. I like to take the example of, of elephants that they, when they migrate, it's typically one of
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.360]   the old females, the old females, the matriarch who leads the way she's the leader. So she'll help
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.600]   them find, she knows where to go essentially. Um, and there's other social roles as well. There
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:14.240]   might be the controller who is the animal who tends to initiate, um, a change in activity. So we see this
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:20.080]   in cows, for instance, that all the cows are standing up and they're, they're grazing. And then one cow,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:26.720]   the controller lies down and everybody else lies down also and they start ruminating.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.960]   They will often synchronize their behavior, but they'll follow. It's not that one individual
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.240]   is sort of imposing on the others, but rather they do that. And the others follow suit.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.960]   Interesting. Um, I have heard this, that, uh, when you walk your dog, that your dog should be next to
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:51.680]   you or behind you. Uh, very few dog owners actually walk with their dog behind them. Just, I live in an area
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.760]   that is, you know, uh, frequented by dogs and, and, and, uh, and owners. Um,
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:05.520]   um, it's interesting to kind of interpret that as a question, which is if the dog walks in front,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:11.120]   does it mean that it somehow is the leader? I mean, are humans just completely wrong about all this stuff?
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.280]   I think so. Yeah. I think that we, we carry a lot of, and actually I, we haven't mentioned this,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.600]   I think, but I, I have very little practical experience about dogs with dogs. I haven't lived
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.960]   with dogs. I haven't trained dogs, but many of my students train dogs and I help them. So,
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:32.560]   so, uh, but, but that also means that I don't carry any of these sort of assumptions that you're,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.000]   you're supposed to have your dog behind you or beside you that if you don't, and so, uh,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.440]   which means that I can, I can look at that type of statement and go, really?
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:49.600]   Yeah. Uh, because I think that, that there's a lot of learning occurring, of course, that we teach
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.040]   the dog that if you stay at my side or behind me, then, you know, there won't be any unpleasantness,
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.520]   but if you pull ahead, I'm going to yank you back. So there'll be an unpleasant, um, uh,
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.280]   consequence to the pulling behavior, which will then influence the animal's choice in staying next
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.640]   to you. But I think we very often, what we label as dominance can very often be just,
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.960]   if we just remove that label and we look at the animal's behavior, we can, we can explain it in other
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:25.360]   terms. And again, I would not use, uh, for me, dominance as an ethologist has to do the prior,
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.440]   with the priority of access to resources.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:34.560]   So along the lines of priority of access to resources, when I got my puppy, I was taught
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:41.680]   in the dog training course that I took with him, uh, that I should eat and then he should eat.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:49.840]   Um, or that we could eat alongside one another different food. Although I confess, I often fed
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:57.360]   him steak. Um, if it was appropriate food for a bulldog, I fed it to him. Uh, it, as opposed to
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.920]   letting him eat before me because of this access to resources thing, is there any truth to that?
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.240]   This is taught in a lot of, uh, dog slash owner training because a lot of dog training is actually
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:13.200]   owner, owner training. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. I, I mean, you have to set up the situation to work for
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:21.120]   you and the animal, but again, I would not frame that in terms of, of, uh, dominance. Dogs, uh, form
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:28.480]   relationships with us, but as far as I know, from the ethological perspective, we have no role in a
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.320]   dominance hierarchy among dogs. They know that we are different and they will respond. They will learn
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.640]   to expect that if in this context that will happen in that context, that will happen. And so we can
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:47.840]   often reframe that, uh, from in a different learning system than dominance. That's a novel perspective
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.360]   because I think that so much of what's out there in terms of dog slash owner training is really about,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.160]   um, not so much dominance, but really trying to establish a relationship where
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.440]   it's clear that you're the caretaker to quote unquote, make them feel safe. Um, so that their
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.720]   job is very clear. So they don't feel the anxiety of needing to perform roles that perhaps are yours.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.320]   There's a lot like what you hear when you hear about parent child training basically. Um, so
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:21.200]   maybe given that the sort of pattern of, of your answers over the last couple of questions, I,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.720]   I should ask the question, um, which is a really straightforward one, which is how do you think about
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.520]   animals? Like, like, what is your view of animals when you, when you think about them? I know you're
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.720]   interested in their welfare and improving their wellbeing and, um, conditions, but how do you like,
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:42.000]   when you see, uh, an animal, um, most people say, okay, well, that's a dog, that's a horse, that's a
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.280]   parrot. Um, can I interact with it? Maybe I don't want to, or maybe I have a phobia, who knows,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   but how do you think about animals? Like what's driving this inquiry in terms of their,
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.360]   their, their emotional and their cognitive life? First of all, I think that we humans are also
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:05.680]   an animal species and that we, we, I, we, we tend to sort of put ourselves on a pedestal and thinking
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:14.160]   that we, we are one and then animals are like this, this, the other, as if it were homogeneous,
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.480]   which is, it really isn't. So, so each animal species have their own adaptation. We have our own
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:27.360]   adaptations and each animal, all the other animal species that we surround ourselves with do as well.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:35.520]   So, um, I don't know if that really answers your question, but, uh, I tend to, so the work I do is
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:43.040]   to sort of try to help animals live better lives with humans. And that very often starts with
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.680]   understanding how that animal species would live in the wild and the type of, of life that they have,
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:56.160]   whether they're a predator, whether they're a prey animal species, uh, how they process the world,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:03.440]   the type of information that they take in. Um, so for instance, we might see a dog who's wagging
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.240]   this tail and we might think that it's only happy dogs that wag their tails, but actually
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:16.160]   tail wagging is seen in many different contexts. Uh, and we might think of it as a visual communication
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.400]   thing, but actually it could be that they're dispersing scent, that the tail wag will sort of,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.720]   that scent will waft over to you so you can, uh, take in information about my current emotional
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.120]   state. They definitely have scent glands back there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So can we
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.480]   interpret dog wags of different types? Is there, is there a way to do that? So one very interesting
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:45.520]   thing is that the dog wagging with a predominant left wag, left for the dog, left for the dog. So
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.240]   he's wagging on the left hand side of his body tends to be associated with negative emotional
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:56.400]   states. And on the right tends to be associated with positive emotional states. Uh, and, and the
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:04.960]   same cats tend to look at the world from the, the left when in a negative emotional state and from the
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:11.120]   right when in a positive emotional state. So looking from the left, meaning the left eye slightly forward,
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.880]   Yeah. Um, the head tilted, so the right eye. So taking in that information with this eye.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.160]   So, okay. If you're scary.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.240]   Some people are just listening. They're not watching, so they can't see this. So what, um,
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.200]   what Carolina is describing is if the, the head is turned slightly to the side, so the left eye is
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.040]   forward. Yeah. That's a, um,
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.080]   So they're looking at the stimulus with their left eye, if that stimulus is fear inducing.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:38.000]   Interesting. And, and the opposite to the right hand side, if it's, um, more attractive to them.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.680]   Yeah. So this is lateralized.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.920]   Interesting. And then the tail wag, you said a dog wagging on the left hand side,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.320]   more negative right hand side and more positive. What about a full sweeps?
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:54.800]   Yeah. Full sweeps. And I, I don't know the details here, but certainly the type of tail wag,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:01.440]   whether it's sort of very low and fast or whether it's high and, and sort of stiff will communicate
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.760]   different emotional states. Do you think that over time we learn these signals without realizing
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.360]   that we learn these signals? Yes, absolutely.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:13.760]   Because we associate it with our dog being in a particular circumstance or behaving in a certain
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:20.240]   way. So studies have shown that, that we humans are actually, um, we learn to read dogs by exposure,
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.680]   even passive exposure, just living in an environment. And apparently it's, it's, if we live in a culture
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:33.200]   where dogs live close with humans, we get better in reading dogs and then in cultures where dogs don't
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:40.400]   interact that much with humans. Um, so there's that. And there's also this, the issue that we are typically
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:48.320]   better at reading gross body language than we are at reading facial expressions. Apparently one of the
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:57.520]   the reasons being that dogs move different facial muscles when they make emotional facial expressions,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.840]   they move different muscles than what humans do.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.880]   What can you tell us about the facial expressions of dogs?
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.800]   Well, there's been some studies in the last couple of years that I've looked at
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:18.000]   which muscles are moving when, in, in which contexts. So, uh, so they'll, they'll expose the dog to
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.640]   different types of stimuli and they'll look at, they'll film the dog and look at what, what muscles are
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:28.880]   twitching where, where is, where is the face moving in response to these stimuli. So those types of studies
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.600]   have found that, that, you know, when you, when a dog is exposed to, let's say,
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:42.480]   thunder or firework sounds, they will show a certain facial configuration. When, uh, their owner returns
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.440]   home after not being seen for several hours, they will show a different facial configuration and so
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.560]   on. So it, it seems that they do show facial expressions. It's just that some of those facial
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.600]   expressions are, it's not the same muscles that we show in the corresponding emotional state. So that would,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:07.360]   I think bias us to misreading dogs, facial expressions, uh, from that perspective. But then
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:14.080]   again, if we live with dogs, we start, we, we won't observe just the facial expression. We will observe
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:19.920]   the entire dog. And we're often better off reading their body language than we are reading their facial
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.280]   expression. Even though I think that studies also show that the face is where we look first.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:35.760]   Which behaviors in dogs, uh, are maintained from interactions with other dogs, uh, when they
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:43.280]   interact with humans? For instance, um, if, uh, one is gonna like take a dog out on a walk and it's
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.320]   familiar with the sound of the leash coming off the, the hook or something like that, it's not uncommon
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:54.080]   for a dog to go into that long, full, um, you know, front leg stretch that people call down dog,
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:00.000]   you know, in yoga. So, um, and some people will say that's a kind of remnant of the puppy play,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.080]   um, kind of stance. Again, people say this stuff. People are often self-appointed dog experts. This is
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.480]   kind of interesting. Like, and the, and I've learned this from researching it online that, that the various
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:19.120]   camps of, of quote unquote, dog experts disagree vehemently with each other. I mean, they write to me
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.920]   saying, you know, they're evil. This person is cruel that, you know, they, they blame each other
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.800]   of animal cruelty for different training, um, different training tools. We'll talk about that
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:35.760]   a little bit later, but, um, dogs will do this, uh, down dog type, uh, movement, whatever it means
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.640]   with other dogs and they'll do it with humans. Do you think it means the same thing in those two
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   different contexts? Most probably does. That's play bow that you're describing is what's referred
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:53.760]   to as a meta signal for play. So it's typically shown in a play context and I haven't seen it
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.120]   described, but then again, I'm not a dog owner, uh, but I haven't seen it described in, in the context of,
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:05.840]   let's go for a walk. But certainly in the play context, um, as far as I know, dogs play a bit
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.040]   differently with humans than they do with other dogs, but they do enjoy playing with humans.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:20.240]   Uh, and, and sometimes I think we humans have a hard time knowing whether what we're seeing is play
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.000]   or aggression because there will be elements from the aggressive repertoire within a play bow.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.640]   But typically what we can do then is look for what's referred to as MARS, M-A-R-S. So M being
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.840]   the meta signals. So those play bows or in other species, it will be other behaviors that are sort
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:45.440]   of indicating that I want to play. Uh, I know chimpanzees have like 30 or 50 different meta signals
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:53.600]   for play. Um, M-A-A is for activity shift. So we'll see different behaviors. They might be chasing,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:01.120]   they might be pouncing, they might be wrestling, biting each other. Uh, but you'll see these activity
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:09.600]   shifts and it's not in the same order as it would be if they were truly fighting. Uh, M-A-R-R is for role
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:16.400]   reversals. So you'll see that the, the dog, uh, the dogs, if they're of different sizes or different,
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:23.520]   um, sort of stamina or how big they are or how competent fighters they are, would be that they'll
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.720]   take turns winning and losing. Yeah. I've seen that. Yeah. Because it's not fun playing if you lose
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.520]   all the time. So in order to keep playing, the bigger dog needs to lose sometimes. So they,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.200]   they need to, in order to, to keep this interaction going, uh, that's the way to do that.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   And the last one, S is self-handicap. So the larger dog will, will self-handicap themselves.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.160]   You might see it, them doing a tug of war and the large, large dog is just standing there and holding
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:54.880]   the thing. And the small dog is like pulling and really trying to get the thing. And the big dog
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.600]   is just standing there doing nothing. But then if a human takes over the toy and starts pulling,
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:05.280]   then the big dog will engage and start showing more of his strength and, and, uh, escalate that
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.160]   behavior. That's a beautiful thing when you see animals adjusting their level of a kind of vigor
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.920]   in play so that the play can continue. It's very sweet. I mean, it, it speaks to a bigger question,
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.720]   which is, uh, do dogs have empathy? Oh, I think so. Absolutely.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:26.160]   I can't say I've, I've seen any studies on it, but, but just, uh, yeah.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.840]   Yeah. I mean, I think, I think so many, uh, dog owners are familiar with when, uh, we're grieving,
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:39.520]   um, a dog will often come closer as opposed to moving further away. Um, I mean, I've seen some
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:45.440]   incredible moments, you know, we interpret these things, right? We anthropomorphize, but I had someone
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:51.360]   in my home years ago who was, was grieving a, a, a death in her family and, uh, Costello came and,
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:57.440]   and, you know, put a paw on her knee. And it's hard to not interpret that, um, as a, a meaningful
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.080]   moment of empathy and who knows what he was experiencing. Uh, maybe he was experiencing
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:08.080]   distress for all I know, but, but it, the, the more pleasant interpretation is that he wanted to extend
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.360]   comfort. I think it makes sense from the evolutionary perspective that social animals who live in a
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:23.200]   cohesive social group, uh, are good at reading each other's, uh, emotional state and also, uh,
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:33.520]   good at sort of trying to buffer negative emotions if, if it's possible to do that. And so I, I would
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.960]   expect it with the, any of the sort of more cognitively advanced species, I would expect
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.520]   some type of empathy. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. AG1 is a
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.920]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens. I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:57.280]   long before I even knew what a podcast was. I started taking it and I still take it every single day
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.240]   because it ensures that I meet my quota for daily vitamins and minerals, and it helps make sure that I get
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.440]   enough prebiotics and probiotics to support my gut health. Over the past 10 years, gut health has
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.000]   emerged as something that we realize is important, not only for the health of our digestion, but also
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.880]   for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, things like
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.560]   dopamine and serotonin. In other words, gut health is critical for proper brain function. Now, of course,
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.200]   I strive to eat healthy whole foods from unprocessed sources for the majority of my nutritional intake,
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.440]   but there are a number of things in AG1, including specific micronutrients that are hard or
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:37.120]   impossible to get from whole foods. So by taking AG1 daily, I get the vitamins and minerals that I need,
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:42.240]   along with the probiotics and prebiotics for gut health, and in turn, brain and immune system health,
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.760]   and the adaptogens and critical micronutrients that are essential for all organs and tissues of the body.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.400]   So anytime somebody asks me if they were to only take one supplement, what that supplement should be,
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:57.280]   I always say AG1, because AG1 supports so many different systems in the brain and body
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.800]   that relate to our mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:10.400]   drinkag1.com/huberman. For this month only, April 2025, AG1 is giving away a free one-month supply of
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:16.640]   omega-3 fish oil, along with a bottle of vitamin D3 plus K2. As I've highlighted before in this podcast,
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:22.240]   omega-3 fish oil and vitamin D3 plus K2 have been shown to help with everything from mood and brain health,
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:29.120]   to heart health and healthy hormone production, and much more. Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.720]   to get the free one-month supply of omega-3 fish oil, plus a bottle of vitamin D3 plus K2 with your
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   subscription. Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve. Juve makes medical-grade red light
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.520]   therapy devices. Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.320]   it is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology. Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.040]   red light and near-infrared light sources have been shown to have positive effects on improving
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.000]   numerous aspects of cellar and organ health, including faster muscle recovery, improved skin
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.440]   health and wound healing, improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation, even mitochondrial
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.320]   function, and improving vision itself. What sets Juve lights apart and why they're my preferred red
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.680]   light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, meaning specific wavelengths of red
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:21.440]   light and near-infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations. Personally,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.720]   I use the Juve whole body panel about three to four times a week, and I use the Juve handheld light both
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:34.480]   at home and when I travel. If you'd like to try Juve, you can go to Juve spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:41.040]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount to all Huberman Lab listeners with up to $400 off Juve products. Again,
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:48.480]   that's Juve spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman to get up to $400 off I've always been
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:59.600]   delighted and curious about the fact that if two animals of the same species both receive food or a
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:08.320]   treat, it seems, I don't know, but it seems that they are paying attention to how much treat the other is
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:13.760]   getting. And as a sibling, I have an older sister who I get along very well with and always have,
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:21.600]   but when we were kids, I'll never forget like if there was a treat like a milkshake or something,
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:28.880]   she would point out that she had slightly more than I did. If there was a slice of cake or something,
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.440]   it was as much as we would look at the slice of cake being served to us, we were looking to see how much
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.920]   the other one got. And this was a reflexive thing. And we're not competitive in any dimension,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:45.840]   really. We've always respected each other's strengths and weaknesses in a way that's very
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:55.440]   complimentary. But when it comes to treats, humans and dogs pay a lot of attention to who's getting what.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:02.640]   Fairness, yeah. There was this experiment done on capuchin monkeys by Frans Duval and his team.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.960]   And apparently they did it and they published a paper on it and, you know, nobody read it. And then
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:18.720]   like a decade later, in preparation for a presentation, they redid some of the experiment and filmed it. And he
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:24.160]   shared that on the presentation. I don't know if you've seen it, but essentially it's two capuchin
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   monkeys and they're next to one another so they can each see what the other is getting. And they're asked
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:36.960]   to do a task, like the researcher hands them a rock and they hand it back to the researcher and then they
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:44.240]   they get a reinforcer. So a treat as payment for that behaviour. And so the first monkey
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:52.640]   gets a piece of cucumber and he's happy. He eats that cucumber. And then the researcher turns towards
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:59.920]   the second monkey and requests the same behaviour, gets the same behaviour and feeds that animal a grape.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:10.720]   And capuchins are not too enthusiastic about cucumbers, but they really love grapes. So when she then turns
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:18.240]   back to the first monkey again and repeats the behaviour and again feeds that one a cucumber that he was happy to
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:25.840]   eat like 30 seconds ago, he actually throws a tantrum and throws it back at the researcher, sort of going, I saw that you
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:33.760]   fed the other guy a grape. And the audience is laughing. So it's like I think we all recognise that situation that we
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:40.560]   we take affront to somebody else getting paid better for the same quality of work.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:45.280]   Yeah, I'm always interested in these studies that every few years something, I didn't know that one,
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:50.080]   so thank you for sharing that, where there's something about resource allocation that's revealed.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.560]   And then for every one of those, there will be a study that shows, for instance, I'm not going to get
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:05.840]   the details right here, but that crows will teach each other ways to open boxes so that another one can
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:12.000]   get food, even if they don't have access to that food. Just it seems like an act of altruism. So we'll see
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   fairness, we'll see altruism. Oh, yes.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:19.280]   A very different picture than this whole notion of dominance hierarchies in every
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.240]   member of a species is just trying to get the most that they possibly can, even at the expense of
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:30.800]   others. It's beautiful in a way, and we again have to be careful not to anthropomorphise, to not assume
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.600]   that members of a species are doing this because they're benevolent. That's a nice, I like that
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:42.240]   interpretation. But maybe as you pointed out before, that having a happy group makes for
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.880]   more happiness for oneself.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:51.840]   Absolutely. I think if the group is doing well, then everybody's better off. So we used to think
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.640]   that there was just sort of individual selection, but there is a certain amount of group selection
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.040]   also. The individual selection is stronger, but certainly if there's a group that collaborates better,
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:07.040]   that will do better than the group that isn't collaborating as well. And it's interesting,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:13.360]   you've mentioned a few times now, the risk of anthropomorphism. And I think that if we look at
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:20.880]   that as a sort of a continuum from anthropomorphism, which we might then define as, you know, thinking
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.360]   that animals are just the same as humans, it's only just that they have some fur, so they're a bit
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:32.880]   different, but more or less the same. And on the other side is what we might refer to as anthropo-denial.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.600]   That was a term coined also by Franz Duval, the one with the Capuchin experiment,
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:47.760]   where we don't recognise that, in fact, there are commonalities between humans and other animal species.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:57.040]   And I think that we, in our sort of fear of anthropomorphism, we have fallen into anthropo-denial.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:02.400]   And I think that the answer is probably somewhere in the middle, that we do share lots of commonalities
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.520]   with animals. I think that, for instance, even though our perception of the world might be really
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:16.400]   different, how we process that information and the types of emotional and mood responses or changes
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:22.800]   in mood that we get in response to the environment are very much the same, although it will be different
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:31.280]   stimuli that different animal species pay attention to that are more or less relevant to them, depending
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:39.600]   on which species it is. But I think that we've so avoided this topic of anthropomorphism, we've been
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.280]   so afraid of it that we've fallen into the other trap, which is sort of denying that they have anything to
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:56.080]   do with us. Let's talk about a species that can be divisive: cats. My sister has cats and I
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:04.720]   don't mind them. I can't say I gravitate toward them, but I don't dislike them. You do own a cat and you're
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   an animal ethologist. Tell us about cats from the perspective of an animal ethologist. When you look
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:20.640]   at a cat, what are you looking for to tell you something about whether or not it's a friendly cat?
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:26.800]   I mean, obviously if it's hair standing up on its back and it's arching and it's hissing, that's obvious.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:33.760]   But what are you looking at in the context of the way that cats evolved and their species in general?
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:43.440]   So the common house cat that we have today as a pet evolved as a solitary hunter,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:52.480]   but that aggregates in social groups, loose social groups. So they sort of hang out together,
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:59:02.640]   but it's not this really cohesive group. And they hunt on their own, so they'll eat on their own also.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:07.120]   And me as an ethologist, what I tend to do when I look at an animal species is I look at three things.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:17.440]   I look at their social environment. So typically with cats I would then say that if they are raised well,
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:23.680]   so they've had the opportunity of spending enough time with mum, typically it should be up to 14 weeks,
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.960]   which I think that we see that in Sweden nowadays. I don't know how it is here in the US, but that seems
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:36.640]   to be long enough for the animal to actually learn how to be a cat so that they don't get too
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:44.720]   emotionally disturbed by the separation once we wean them and sort of put them in a new environment.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:50.560]   So just looking at the social bit is one thing that I do, the first thing that I do. The second thing
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:56.480]   that I do is I look at how do they get food? So again, cats are solitary hunters. So I would
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:04.160]   look into ways of, and they, as opposed to dogs, cats typically retain the whole hunting sequence.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:12.320]   Sometimes the killing bite isn't quite there, but certainly the grab bite and the fact that some cats
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.760]   will, if it's an outdoor cat that they might bring their prey back home is to me, it's simply,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.720]   it's not that they want to gift you with their kill, but rather that they feel safe.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:34.160]   So they're simply bringing their prey to a place where they feel safe.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.400]   So it's not a gift. We can put that one to rest.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.200]   I wouldn't say, I would not call that a gift now.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:46.400]   I had a girlfriend in graduate school and her cat would catch these very large mice and put them
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.240]   in our shoes at night. It was dreadful.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.000]   Would the cat put them in the shoes or would the mice hide in the shoes?
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.760]   Well, they were dead when we found them. So I'm assuming that the cat would put them in the shoes.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:09.280]   The cat also loved to retrieve tin foil balls, little tin foil balls. I've never seen a cat retrieve.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.000]   At first I didn't, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the cat and then I developed a really close
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.920]   relationship with it, at least from my side, I thought it was a close relationship.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:25.440]   And he would catch mice, put them in our shoes at night while we slept. It was pretty unpleasant. You
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.160]   had to check your shoes in the morning. So those weren't gifts.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:35.840]   I would not assume that they were gifts. No, no. From what I know, cats will sort of bring back what they
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:44.080]   catch to a place where they feel safe. And then they often lose interest if it's not moving anymore.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:52.320]   So, so, and if, obviously if, if your cat or that cat killed the mice, they had, that cat had progressed
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.560]   to the actual killing bite. Many cats don't do that. They only have the crab bites. So they'll,
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.320]   they'll just let the, the little rhodod go to run off.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.840]   I've seen that. Well, they'll play with them, right?
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:09.040]   Yeah. So, so they'll let it go. And if the mouse is still, they can actually just sort of escape
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.360]   attention because the animal, the cat might grow bored and walk away.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.840]   But the moment they start moving again, then they're sort of restarting that whole
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:25.440]   predatory sequence again. But back to your question about how to interact with cats or whether,
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.120]   how to read them. So that would be the third thing that I'm looking at is how do
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:36.960]   the animal species in front of me, how do they respond to perceived threat? And I'm saying perceived
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.480]   threat here because sometimes we are well-intended. We're like, hi. And we want to,
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.120]   we want to hug them because we're primates. And they really don't like that. So, so they will respond
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:57.120]   to us as if we were a predator. And I think that, again, comes down very much to the types of interaction,
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:03.360]   social interactions, the type of learning that the, the animal has had when they're really young. So for
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:10.160]   instance, there's a study showing that if you handle young kittens between the ages of like two and eight
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.600]   weeks for at least an hour a day, and, and when I say handle, I just mean that sort of interact with
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:24.000]   them and, and play and have them sort of on your lap and so on, they will become very social as adults.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.640]   So they will be the type of cat that will jump up into your lap and fall asleep purring. If you interact
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:37.840]   with that young kitten less than like 15 minutes a day, they won't be fearful of humans, but they'll
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.680]   be more like walking up to you and saying hi, and then walking away.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:51.360]   So, so I think that early life experiences can really shape the type of temperament,
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.360]   if you will, or how sort of vigorously animals respond to changes in the environment.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:05.120]   What is this behavior of bumping, uh, where the cat bumps its head against you or your arm? Uh,
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.840]   is it to, um, spread smell? Yeah, I would say that is scent marking. Yeah.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.920]   So, and when they're scent marking you, why are they scent marking?
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.720]   I would think that it's, it's like something you do in your group, you do mutual scent marking,
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.680]   which means that everybody in the group smells more or less the same. So it's a, it's a way of sort of
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:32.640]   greeting and incorporating the others in the group. So there'll be a lot of scent exchange within,
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.880]   uh, this type of species living in the group. That would be my guess as to why they do that.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.960]   So is scent marking about territory as well? Like if a cat, you know, scent marks in corners and-
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:51.040]   Oh yeah. They, but that's a different, that's typically not the, because they have like multiple
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:58.720]   scent glands in the face that are, and, and one of them is used to scent mark sort of the inner territory.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.760]   And this is where they feel really safe. And then they usually have this urine scent marking,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.520]   which is in the out sort of, um, the outskirts of the territory. And you, you might see this if you,
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:16.560]   if for instance, you have an indoor cat and they start peeing and you bring out a piece of paper
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:24.880]   and a layout of your, um, your house or apartment and you start sort of putting a little ring to where
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:31.200]   you find the, the pee, that will give you a lot of information because if, if it's a territorial thing,
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:38.160]   it will typically be at the edges of sort of at the windows or doors. If it's a, an elimination problem
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:45.600]   that the cat has sort of maybe perhaps, uh, it hurts when he pees. So then he learns to associate pain
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:52.000]   with going in the box. And so the box starts representing painful experiences. So he will
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.120]   start going outside of the box, but that type of behavior will be seen in that context instead.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:03.680]   Interesting. Um, so if your cat is urinating inside, you know, have a, an experiment to run.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.440]   The use of a litter box is a pretty interesting one to me. It's not what I spent a lot of time
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.120]   thinking about, but if you sort of step back and you say, okay, here's this animal that we've
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:20.720]   domesticated and it readily learns how to cover its waste. Um, which is very different than a dog,
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:27.680]   which can be trained to with withhold until you go out on a walk. That's basically the two different
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:34.880]   strategies there. Um, and I don't know what it is if you own a monkey, um, or something else, but
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:42.080]   what is it about the covering of waste behavior? Is that something in cats, is that a natural behavior
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:50.560]   they do in the wild? And if they roam, why do they bother? Is it, um, and then sort of tack to this,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:57.200]   is that with dogs, oftentimes after they eliminate waste, they'll step away from it and kick dirt in
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.920]   the general direction. And I've heard it interpreted two ways. One is that they're trying to spread scent
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.720]   and the other is that they're trying to cover waste. So again, uh, this is why I was interested in
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.560]   talking to an animal ethologist as opposed to a pet, uh, behavioral trainer, right? I'm also interested
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:18.800]   in that, but, but I think we have to again, acknowledge that much of the interpretation that we have about
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:24.000]   animals behavior is just human interpretation. So certainly. So what is this, uh, covering of waste?
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.360]   Do we know what it's for in the wild in cats? The covering of waste, um, is a way to sort of reduce
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:39.200]   the risk of infection. I would assume that they also don't eliminate close to where they eat. So if we have
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.720]   a house, a cat in our house, we shouldn't have the litter box next to the food, which I wish I had known
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:50.880]   where I had my first cat 20 years ago, cause she had that very set up with the food right next to
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.480]   the litter box. And I would also assume that the behavior of dogs, when they sort of kick at their
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:04.800]   poop typically, right? Not, uh, pee, uh, that it's a way of spreading scent. Uh, because if it were
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.000]   covering scent, the behavior would look very different, I think, but I haven't seen any sort of
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.000]   any scientific study on that topic. Okay. So cat owners take note, separate the food from the
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:24.880]   litter box by, by some distance. I was always, um, somewhat surprised, uh, although less so over time,
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:33.120]   uh, uh, how much determination and effort my bulldog would put into peeing on things on walks.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.240]   Yeah. I feel like it was one of his great joys in life. There I go again, anthropomorphizing, but,
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:46.640]   but to smell something and then pee there, um, he seemed to have an endless supply of urine for this.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.320]   Um, it was really remarkable. Yeah. You know, as, as a scientist and someone who loves dogs and
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   loved him, you know, more than words, I just was like, this is amazing. Like he loves this behavior.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:03.280]   Yeah. And he's also reading the pee mail from the other dogs that are in the neighborhood. So the
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.760]   urine tells a lot of information to the other animal. It tells what, what gender, what, you know,
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.200]   reproductive state, perhaps also something about the animal's emotional state or mental state.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.200]   So I wouldn't hesitate to say that, that, that was one of the joys of life for, for dogs that they,
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.400]   that's after all, that's how they communicate. So it's, and they spend a lot of time doing it and
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.120]   they're willing to work to get access to that, uh, opportunity. So I've absolutely, I would,
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.000]   I would think that it gives them positive emotional experiences doing that.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:42.400]   So there's some innate drive in, in dogs, it seems to, um, read the emotional and hormonal states of
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.200]   other dogs that have been, been there to me. It, it felt like their form of social media.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.680]   Yeah. Like I'm going to post here. What are other people posting here? What's going on?
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:57.600]   Yeah. Um, I mean, clearly there's some brain real estate devoted to this behavior. I'm not,
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.080]   I'm not, I'm not being facetious. I mean, I look, I look at Alec, you know, you get a human brain,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.440]   40% of that real estate is for vision.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:14.080]   Another 40% it's mixed in there with other stuff is for motor behavior. We have neural real estate
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.080]   for smelling and certainly for touch. But even if you're a massage therapist or you're a, or you do,
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:26.320]   you know, touch based work, you're, uh, even if you're a braille reader, um, the amount of neural
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.560]   real estate for these other things is, is vastly larger, except for the blind person where the visual
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.600]   stuff is taken over by the tactile stuff and auditory. So amount of real estate correlates.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.200]   Um, so when I see a behavior that's like, this is what, this is one of the main things dogs do.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.080]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty striking. Yeah. So dogs descended from, they were domesticated
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.400]   from wolves correctly. Did that happen at independent locations around the earth?
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.440]   I don't really know the answer to that question, but it seems that they domesticated themselves,
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:04.800]   that it was sort of wolves that started hanging out next to human habitation and that it was sort of
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:13.200]   the, the, the least fearful and the sort of most, uh, explorative wolves that dared do this. So,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.720]   so it was, it was, it wasn't that we caught wolves and said, aha, I'm going to breed you now,
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:25.040]   but it was rather that that was, it was like a symbiotic relationship that developed over time.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.400]   Interesting. I don't know of any other species that does that, except maybe, uh, like certain
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.960]   fish or dolphins that follow fishing boats so they can get some of the catch. But that's different
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   because, you know, I see these Instagram videos of like an otter jumping on a kayak and there's some
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.640]   interaction, uh, that's regular, you know, that the person goes out on their kayak, they interact with
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.760]   this otter. So animals will do this, but usually there's some sort of, uh, food. It just sounds like
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:58.320]   food payoff is, is, and safety is really the key. Does that mean that animals at, at a very basic level
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:05.680]   are looking to optimize food intake and safety? And what does that tell us about zoos? I personally have a,
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:15.280]   uh, pretty strong, um, visceral reaction to zoos that, um, have large carnivores. Uh, I realized we
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.400]   could have a discussion about elephants too, but I feel like large carnivores housed in zoos creates
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.240]   some issues for me. I won't go into what this is, but, but I'm also here that zoos have, um,
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:33.440]   positive, uh, breeding programs, uh, endangered species protection programs. Uh, what's your take
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.480]   on zoos? When we talk about zoos, it's perhaps good to talk about the evolution of zoos because
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:44.160]   back in the day, like 150 years ago, it used to be more or less a menagerie that, you know,
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.520]   here's a lion and here's an elephant and here's a zebra. And they were on in little,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:56.480]   small cages and the only thing that you did was see the animal really. Zoos today tend to
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:03.760]   have the purpose of doing a lot of conservation work. So there's, there's, um, what's referred
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.480]   to as in situ conservation, where you work to preserve wild habitats and creating national parks,
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:16.880]   et cetera, and sort of giving the opportunities for, for reintroduction of species and so on. And
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:22.960]   there's ex situ conservation, which is then housing those, uh, animal species that are, are threatened
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   with extinction in an environment. And ideally that environment should then be good enough to promote,
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   uh, um, species typical behavior and so on. So I'm, I'm, I mean, I'm conflicted.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:46.320]   I think that, that many zoos are sort of doing a lot of, um, a lot of good in, in, in this effort
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:53.120]   and also educating the public. And many, I think that many people who go to zoos that might awaken
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:01.280]   in them an interest in animals, which I think is a good thing that we, that we care about animals,
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:08.720]   but also that sometimes the, the, um, the housing is, isn't optimal. And certainly some
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:14.560]   species are a lot more difficult to keep in captivity compared to others. So polar bears
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.480]   are, are really difficult to keep because they're, they're, they're ranging, um, carnivores.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:27.440]   They walk miles and miles and miles, and it's really difficult to, to provide those species specific
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:36.400]   opportunities in captivity compared to other, uh, uh, carnivores who have more of a, a different type of
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:45.040]   approach to, to predation. One of the things that really turned me on to, uh, just how, um, more
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:52.000]   sophisticated, um, cat species are than I ever assumed was, um, something that happened when I
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.680]   was a postdoc at, also at Stanford. Uh, I was a member of the San Francisco zoo. The San Francisco
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.960]   zoo is an outdoor zoo by comparison to most other zoos I've been to. And I haven't been to that many,
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:11.280]   but it's a pretty, uh, nice landscape. Um, there's an outdoor lemur, uh, I call it an exhibit, but you
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.560]   know, in, uh, indoor, outdoor lemur thing, that's really amazing. There's some giraffes, all this.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:23.840]   Well, um, around the time I was in, when I was a postdoc, I was briefly tell this story. I was at the
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.280]   movies in San Francisco and I, I stepped out to get something to drink. And the kid behind the counter
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.080]   said that a tiger escaped from the San Francisco zoo and is killing people. And I thought,
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.520]   what? Like, that's crazy. It turns out that was only partially true. What had happened is there was
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:47.360]   a tiger there, Tatiana, who, um, they used to have these moats around the tiger enclosure and it was
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.040]   very close to Christmas. People can look this up and get the details. And there were a couple of kids
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   who were throwing either pine cones or, or throwing something at the tigers. Okay.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:06.000]   The zoo was near shutting down. Tatiana either ran up or jumped the moat. I don't know how she did it.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.840]   Um, got out and moved through the crowd. This is the, to me, the interesting part, moved through the
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.160]   crowd, completely ignoring most of the people that were around centered in on and killed one of the kids.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:30.560]   Then moved to the second kid, worked him pretty well. The authorities showed up, killed Tatiana.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:39.280]   This opened up a whole discussion in the zoo community, um, raised a lot of, uh, kind of
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.000]   complicated questions about enclosures, et cetera. The enclosures there, by the way, now are very
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.320]   different. They have these high glass, uh, as well. And of course, the ending was sad for everybody. Um,
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:56.240]   I took a break from my membership there. I reactivated it a few years later. They know, I don't, that tiger,
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:02.720]   you know, obviously is gone, but, um, I, I still am conflicted about, um, about this whole picture. What's
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.880]   interesting to me is the intentionality of the tiger. So this was not a bloodthirsty tiger that just
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:15.840]   wanted to kill humans or eat humans. It was those two humans that pissed her off and those two humans
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.720]   were gonna pay and they paid. The family sued the zoo and then the, then it was a whole thing. I don't
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.800]   know how it ended up with the law, with the lawsuit, but it was a whole thing. So people can look this up
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:36.640]   online. Um, when you hear that, that a tiger did that as opposed to just going into a frenzy the way
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:41.200]   humans sometimes go into a frenzy, attacking whoever and as many people as possible.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.480]   What do you think? What, what, what does it tell us about tigers and their, um, consciousness?
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:56.640]   I think we often don't give animals enough credit. Uh, to me, it's not surprising that, that she,
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:04.000]   she experienced something really unpleasant that she came to associate with two individuals
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:13.600]   and that generated a negative emotional state and aggressive behavior that she then carried out,
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.320]   directed towards those two people. Does it surprise you how directed it was?
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.080]   No. As opposed to just, I mean, there were plenty of people around that were an easier,
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:30.240]   um, you know, easier kill. I would think that a fearful animal might lash out at anyone,
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:37.200]   one, but an animal that is angry tends to be more premeditated in a way.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.200]   Yeah. Calculated. Calculated in a way.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:45.600]   Yeah. So I would expect that if, if you had scared the tiger, she might show defensive aggression,
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.720]   which is just lashing out at whoever is closest. Uh-huh.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.000]   But this was offense, offensive aggression. And so that is, that is premeditated.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.160]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function. Last year, I became a
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.960]   Function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing. Function
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:11.120]   provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health. This
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.000]   snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health, immune functioning, nutrient
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.520]   levels, and much more. They've also recently added tests for toxins, such as BPA exposure from harmful
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.440]   plastics and tests for PFASs or forever chemicals. Function not only provides testing of over 100
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:33.040]   biomarkers key to your physical and mental health, but it also analyzes these results and provides insights
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:38.720]   from top doctors who are expert in the relevant areas. For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.840]   I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood. Function not only helped me detect that,
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.240]   but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels, which included limiting my tuna
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:53.040]   consumption. I've been eating a lot of tuna, while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.440]   supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, both of which can support glutathione production and
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.880]   detoxification. And I should say, by taking a second Function test, that approach worked. Comprehensive
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:07.760]   blood testing is vitally important. There's so many things related to your mental and physical health
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.160]   that can only be detected in a blood test. The problem is blood testing has always been very
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:17.040]   expensive and complicated. In contrast, I've been super impressed by Function's simplicity
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.320]   and at the level of cost. It is very affordable. As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.200]   advisory board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast. If you'd like to try Function,
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.280]   you can go to functionhealth.com/huberman. Function currently has a waitlist of over 250,000 people,
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.680]   but they're offering early access to Huberman podcast listeners. Again,
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.160]   that's functionhealth.com/huberman to get early access to function.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:50.560]   Can we talk a little bit about the, um, the prey and stalking and capture and killing sequence?
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.360]   Mm-hmm.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:58.720]   One of the things that, um, I'm always been fascinated by is when a, let's just use a cat as an example,
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:06.080]   could be large cat, could be small cat, is in its stalking mode that it essentially gets one ballistic
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.600]   strike opportunity before the, the, before the chase is on or, or the animal gets away or it gets caught,
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.400]   right? Yeah.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:20.960]   And we, we'll see the, um, we had a cat when I was a kid, um, that would like stalk and,
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:26.880]   you know, so obviously that creep up. And then right before it would leap at the prey,
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:34.240]   it would, it would start shattering its teeth. Um, I'm assuming that was behavioral suppression
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.880]   or something leaking through what, what's going on when, when a animal does that very deliberate
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:45.040]   stalking, that calculation, um, and the like teeth chatters or, or like twitching is starting to occur.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:45.760]   What is that?
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.840]   My guess would be perhaps some sort of, sort of displacement behavior,
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:55.120]   that there's motivation to move on in the sequence of behaviors to the next behavior,
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:01.120]   but it's not quite time yet. And so that sort of activation then gets an outlet through that
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.840]   behavior. But I really don't know. I don't know. I haven't seen this discussed.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.560]   So it's almost like a, like a hydraulic pressure or something.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:06.960]   Maybe.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.120]   Interesting. Interesting. Um, we've talked about dogs. We've talked about cats.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.240]   Let's talk about birds. Okay.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.080]   I had parrots when I was a kid, they were domestically bred, little gray cheek dwarf parrots.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:27.520]   It didn't turn out poorly. It didn't turn out great. They were, um, I didn't clip their wings
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:31.200]   because I couldn't bring myself to, and they flew around my room a lot and
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:37.200]   shit around the room a lot and threw a lot of food on the ground a lot. And eventually made sense to
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.320]   give them to somebody who had a, an aviary. Um, parrots are smart. Yeah.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.200]   Yeah. What are parrots thinking about?
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.000]   I think what, what all animals are thinking about, where their next meal is going to come from,
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.680]   uh, social interactions and whether there's any threat anywhere.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.960]   Is that really their, like 90% of their conscious life?
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:05.360]   I would say, I would say that, um, uh, if the animal doesn't feel safe, then it's very hard to
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.560]   engage the animal in any type of sort of, if you, if an animal is fearful and you try to feed them,
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.960]   they often won't take food for instance. So the sense of safety has a very high priority because if
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.800]   you don't feel safe, you could die essentially. So if you're in a situation where you don't feel safe,
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.800]   it's because that situation is potentially dangerous, there could be predators around,
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.320]   and then you must focus your attention on those predators because otherwise you're going to die.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.920]   And that of course depends on the species. Some species are sort of aggregate in big
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:42.960]   flocks, if we're talking birds, and some are, um, pair bonding species. But the social
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:50.720]   environment is really important, both with regards to, uh, uh, you know, um, parenting behavior. So
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.240]   sexual behavior, parenting behavior, raising young and so on, all of that also has high priority because
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:03.440]   it's essentially about, um, furthering your genes into the next generation. Um, and then, uh, and then
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.640]   foraging behaviors, where am I going to get my next meal? We feed them on a plate. We're thinking like,
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.880]   we, we think that we're doing them a service, like here's, here's your food on the plate. You don't have
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:20.640]   to do anything, but they come equipped to actually show their food getting repertoire of behaviors.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.760]   So typically if we don't allow them to show those behaviors, we might see some problem behaviors
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:31.840]   popping up instead because they will redirect that, that energy, that, um, intention into,
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.560]   I don't know, did you have any problems with the animals sort of, the birds, you know, ripping your
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.480]   carpet or, or, oh, they destroyed everything. I mean, they destroyed, I mean, that they took great
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:51.040]   pleasure in ripping everything. Books, books, covers, yeah. Like the foraging behavior directed
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.760]   towards the wrong thing. Yeah. Yeah. I don't recommend anyone own parrots, frankly. Uh, that
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.240]   was an experiment gone wrong. Uh, luckily they're, I think they're still alive. They live a very long
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.080]   time. Oh. And people can look up the Ecuadorian gray cheek, uh, dwarf parrots. They have this beautiful,
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.040]   um, orange under their wings. They have little gray cheeks and they, they were called pocket
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.560]   parrots. Uh, you know, the, the, the excitement for me at that, I was young, I was probably 11,
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:20.000]   was that I'd be able to like carry them around in my pocket. They didn't want to do that at all.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.960]   Yeah. Um, anyway, um, it's interesting to think about this need for animals to express their
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:33.600]   natural repertoire of behaviors for dog owners. Um, I think that the common practice is to, you know,
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.720]   put out a bowl of food, uh, would we be better off bringing the food to a park and, and going to the
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:46.000]   park and then having them eat there? Um, or somehow incorporating the, the, the roaming and, and, um,
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.720]   prey seeking, uh, behavior. I mean, how would one incorporate that into a more, uh, pleasant experience
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.880]   for, for the dog? Because what you're saying makes total sense that they need to express these behaviors.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.600]   They're not, if they're, if they can't, um, um, it's going to come out some other way and maybe
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:05.840]   the destructive to them or the environment. Yeah. Essentially, I think that for dog owners,
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:12.400]   that what we can do is we can try to promote the different aspects of the predatory sequence that,
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:19.200]   that particular dog in front of us enjoys doing. Uh, I, I mentioned nose work as being one of the
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.160]   things that, that many dogs really enjoy. And interestingly, and this is, this is just sort of
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.920]   of the early days of scientific studies on the effects of nose work, uh, are really promising
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.480]   that, that one of the effects of nose work seems to be. So if you, if you're not familiar with it,
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:42.160]   it's essentially that the animal has learned that he needs to find a specific scent in an area. And so
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.120]   he sniffs the area, he roams the area and he follows the scent and he'll, he'll stop and mark when he finds
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.520]   the scent and then he gets a reinforcer. So he gets rewarded for, for doing that. So that's,
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.880]   that's, that's essentially more or less a setup. And it seems that it helps regulate arousal so that animals
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:06.960]   who are sort of highly strong and almost, uh, um, have generalized anxiety get calmed down. And the ones
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:17.520]   that are sort of, uh, semi-depressed get, um, sort of, uh, more, um, more enthusiastic about life. And, and also,
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.160]   and, and, um, if we're back in core effect space, again, we have this shift to the right-hand side of
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.760]   the core effect space. So we have positive valence associated with that. Uh, and it seems really
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:35.280]   interesting, um, early days still, because this, this, um, dog sport is like just, I don't know, 15 years
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:42.080]   old or something. It's not very, not very old. So essentially what we can do is we can, um, every
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:48.160]   dog could do nose work. I think that would be an interesting sort of an outlet for that very first
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.480]   part of the behavior sequence. And then I know that some, some, um, um, trainers are working
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:03.840]   specifically to, to help dogs who chase wildlife, for instance. And it's about teaching the dog to
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:11.760]   stay in the first parts of the predatory sequence, to do the sniffing, the, the, uh, the pointing and the,
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:18.400]   um, the, um, the eyeing behavior and then getting reinforced for that so many times so that it
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.600]   becomes like a feedback loop that they, they see a, they see a deer running across the road and they
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:30.000]   go, mom, I saw a deer and they get reinforced for that. So, and other dogs like greyhounds that love
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.600]   chasing that you allow them to do that. And then, uh, other dogs that really allow sort of, uh, um,
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:44.000]   that really enjoy, uh, carrying things that you allow them to do that. And then give your poodle,
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:51.120]   uh, an old, um, something to rip apart, you know, and disembowel things.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.520]   Yeah. Poodles like to, to, to kill and to, to, to, to the post kill ripping apart.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.760]   Yeah. Rip them apart. Gosh, the, the name and the look of a poodle suggests a much,
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.040]   a much more docile animal. So they really like to rip bodies apart.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.040]   Yeah. As far as I understand. Yes.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.800]   And that makes sense. Um, given what I understand about the dosing of different genes.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.960]   And then also I would, you know, rather than serving food on the plate, you might
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:18.800]   try scatter feeding. So just, uh, or, or feeding it in a way that the animal actually has to work for
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.000]   it. So do some behavior like, um, one of these snuffle mats, you hide the food in there. So they have to
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.320]   to actually spend some time looking for the food before consuming it. Because otherwise,
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.720]   if you serve it in a bowl, the animal, some animals simply, you know, they inhale it. It takes like
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:40.480]   30 seconds and they're done. Costello ate like a seagull. Yeah. Yeah. Really. He wouldn't chew his food.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:47.920]   Yeah. It's interesting. The, um, the, the dog food, uh, training, uh, animal health world sells
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.920]   lots of things where you can put food inside of an object where they have to really work hard at it.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.240]   Yeah. I had mixed, uh, you know, sort of mixed results with that because I, I, I have heard that
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:05.760]   in addition to exercise and wanting your proximity that animals, dogs in particular, perhaps really
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:12.480]   need that cognitive work that they, they get bored and they really need the challenge of,
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:18.000]   of, of working their mind so much so that on rainy days, when you like, if weather's really bad and
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.360]   you can't go out that they need an immense amount of kind of like search and forage type behavior.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:28.800]   So I would, I, I strive to do that. Um, and I know some people might hear this and just think,
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.560]   this is crazy. Like my dog just wants to curl up at my feet and it just wants to fetch the ball,
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:38.640]   but that's for fetching breeds. If I threw a ball to Costello, he would go to it and then just sit
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:43.760]   on top of it. He had no interest whatsoever in doing anything with that in terms of retrieving it.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:50.480]   But he would love to just love to tug. So just, you know, if I tied a, a rope to a tree, for instance,
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:55.200]   he would jump on, on there and hold on. And I could swing him by his body way to, you know,
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:01.120]   90 pounds and he'd stay up there for 10 minutes. Yeah. Like the, the pleasure of chewing was clearly
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:06.640]   the strongest innate drive. So I think what I'm realizing is that understanding the sequence of
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.560]   natural behaviors, but also where in that sequence, a particular breed really leans to.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.680]   Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So sometimes it can be hard to know where your dog is on that scale,
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.240]   especially if it's like a mixed breed of some type. And then you can often actually just look at
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:29.200]   at the confirmation of the dog. So those very lean, I'm thinking greyhound now, the, the lean dog with,
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:37.760]   with not much muscle and very pointy snout tends to be the chasers and the, the ones with more muscles,
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:44.560]   front muscles and, and bigger jaws tend to be the, the ones that rip things apart.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:50.000]   Bulldogs, Rottweilers, Mastiffs. And some of the smaller ones, the pugs, the French bulldogs,
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.120]   I think people don't appreciate how that the breeding down because people now, you know,
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.520]   a lot of people have dogs who live in apartments, you know, smaller dogs, although there's this weird
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.480]   thing. Uh, you know, you talk to a vet of a family member who's a vet and you say, what's a great
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.880]   like apartment dog. And they'll say great Dane because they don't need a ton of space to roam,
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:13.280]   but as you have to walk them, but they don't need long walks compared to like a little terrier
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.680]   sometimes needs to just go, go, go, go, go. I mean, needs two hours or more of activity.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.680]   Yeah. I think you need to pay a lot of attention to the type of life that you're going to offer,
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:27.120]   whether it's, you know, living in an apartment in a busy city or whether it's, uh, you know,
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:33.760]   you're on a farm somewhere that which, which breed of dog is going to adapt best to that lifestyle.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.680]   Do you think dogs like cities?
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:43.840]   I think many dogs get very stressed in cities because of the constant bombardment of sensory
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:48.960]   information. So there's noise, there's dogs. So if you're out walking on the street, there's
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:56.160]   constantly meeting strangers. And for many animal species, meeting strangers, A, doesn't happen very
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:03.200]   often. And B, causes, um, uh, an increase in arousal because it, it could be, you know,
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.040]   a friend or foe. It could be some, someone that you want to fight with. It could be someone you
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:13.280]   want to have sex with. You need to assess the situation. And I think that, that dogs are quite
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:18.000]   unique in that respect and that they have a high tolerance for strangers because many other animal
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.560]   species do not. And I think that we tend to forget that sometimes that we, we introduce animals to,
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:30.160]   two animals that they don't know. We expect them to get along and they don't. That, that type of
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:36.560]   introduction needs to be done really carefully. Typically we might start with, um, with, uh,
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.560]   just exchanging scents. So if you're, if you have one cat and want to get a second cat, for instance,
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:47.280]   they typically won't just accept the other the way that two dogs might do, for instance. So then you might
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:52.720]   have them in different rooms and you might rub one cat with one towel and rub one, the other
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:59.680]   cat with another towel and then exchange towels. And then you might want to gradually incorporate
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   other sensory modalities too, so that they'll start hearing each other. And finally that they
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.880]   start seeing each other. And then at the end, the tactile, so the actual physical contact. And if you
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.280]   do it that way, you reduce the risk that they'll actually start fighting when you do the introduction.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.560]   Because if you just put them together, they might just escalate to aggression right away. But if you
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:26.480]   do it gradually, they, that exchange of information will help them sort of figure out who the other is
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.600]   and reduce the risk of aggression. I think I've always been fascinated by, and there's a little
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.640]   bit of data starting to emerge on this as to what the mechanisms might be is self versus other species
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:47.760]   recognition. Most notably that dogs, unless it's a dominance behavior, don't try to mate with cats,
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.920]   for instance. They might hump, but that's a separate thing. They're actually separate circuits. My
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:35:00.000]   colleague David Anderson at Caltech did a really beautiful study. Can I just, the takeaway shows that
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.720]   there are separate circuits in the brain for mounting behavior for sex versus mounting behavior for
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:10.480]   dominance. Oh, interesting. And the mounting behavior for dominance circuits exist in males and females of
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:16.160]   a species where only the male mounts for purposes of reproduction. So this notion of mounting as a
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:22.720]   dominance behavior is a very real thing, even in mice. In any case, the setting mounting for
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:30.240]   dominance behavior aside, AKA humping, it's remarkable. Like a horse doesn't try and mate with a dog. Different
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:37.360]   species of animals seem to know self versus other. Yeah. They don't have to learn it from their mom. Yeah. Or
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:43.520]   dad. Yeah. Or us. It's innate. It's innate. Yeah. For most species, there's actually a few
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:50.080]   a few exceptions being, uh, uh, uh, what comes to mind is, um, uh, certain
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:36:00.320]   waterfowl birds where a female, and I can't say which species now, but some species of water
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:10.640]   bird. The female recognizes the male innately, but the male learns through sexual imprinting when
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:17.920]   they're young to sort of be attracted to females that resemble the female that reared them. And
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.480]   essentially this, this is because, um, in, in those species, the males are typically very
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:28.320]   ornamented and sort of really fabulous looking. And the females are, um, cryptic. They're like
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:37.440]   camouflaged. So they'll, they're like brown. So the males need to learn what mom looks like. And when they grow
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:45.920]   up, they'll start, um, courting, uh, females that look like mom. And so if you raise such a male with the wrong species,
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.640]   they'll start courting the wrong female. And of course she won't be interested because she,
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:58.320]   he doesn't look like the, her, her, her, her golden standard of what a male of that species is supposed to
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:58.640]   look like.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:04.320]   It's so interesting as a kid who had aquaria, you can tell I've had a lot of different animals. Um,
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:13.440]   you know, I would never, I never successfully bred, um, fish in captivity. Um, uh, I tried to breed
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.640]   cuttlefish in captivity in my lab that didn't work, although I successfully raised them, but I got really
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:25.440]   into freshwater discus for a while and tried very hard to get a breeding tank going. It's very difficult.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.280]   Um, but occasionally, you know, someone in the aquarium community that I was a part of would
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:37.920]   succeed in getting, you know, breeding between, uh, discus fish, but you never ever, ever see an
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:44.000]   instance of like a discus fish trying to, uh, fertilize the eggs of a, uh, uh, of a different
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.680]   species of fish. They just know.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.200]   And it's gotta be for them odorant, uh, or presumably mixed sensory. Um, it's, it's really
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:57.620]   a striking aspect of even in speed, but I have friends who study flies. So if they study, um,
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:03.920]   Drosophila, uh, of one particular type, the, the, the one type of fruit fly will not try to
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:09.000]   mate with another type of fruit fly and they look very similar to you and me. So there's, there's
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.180]   something really powerful there.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:17.220]   that sort of, um, there's inbreeding avoidance is, is, is sort of, uh, uh, a mechanism that
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:22.480]   prevents many animal species from, from mating with someone who's too genetically similar to
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:29.160]   yourself since we get this inbreeding depression, but there's also sort of don't, don't waste your
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.820]   time mating with someone that's like, you can't even produce offspring. However, one, one other
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:41.160]   exception that came to mind was ungulates. Sometimes, uh, and I have this memory of the
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:51.340]   being, I was in Africa about back in 1995, um, at the Chimfunji wildlife orphanage, um, walking
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:56.800]   chimps into the forest to, to sort of rehabilitate them. And, and then they had a young duiker
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:06.920]   there, which is a very small, like, yay high, um, antelope kind of thing who had been orphaned
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.420]   and raised, bottle raised and sexually imprinted on humans.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:12.420]   Wow.
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:19.100]   So he came up and started, you know, humping me, more or less thinking that I was his, uh, his
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:25.740]   kind. So that type of sexual imprinting is when, when predominantly, I think males learn, they
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:31.100]   imprint sexually on the type of individual that raised them. So that's the type of individual
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:37.120]   that they will then later also try to court. I think Conrad Lawrence had also in his, one
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:44.160]   of his books, he described some sort of corvid species who he also raised from young and who
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:54.060]   started courting his, uh, like, uh, secretary or someone. And the interesting story there was
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:40:01.940]   the courting behavior in this bird is, is, um, uh, vomiting, uh, you know, leaving like
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:10.980]   a present and offering food in any open surface. So, or orifice. So he would try, he would try
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:15.160]   to sort of get her to open her mouth. And when she didn't, he would go and, and, and leave
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.820]   the present in her ear instead.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:22.760]   Disgusting. People can offset their disgust by, uh, we'll provide a link to the now very
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:29.260]   famous picture of Con, of Conrad Lorenz who won the Nobel prize, I believe, um, for, uh,
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:33.600]   his discoveries of, about imprinting where the geese would imprint on him. It's him swimming
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.060]   in a lake with the, with the trail of, of baby geese behind him, the goslings behind him.
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:41.600]   So that's, that's the other type of imprinting you're talking about. That's filial imprinting.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.580]   So there are two types. There's the sexual imprinting where you learn who to make with and
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:50.940]   there's the filial imprinting where you sort of learn who to feel safe with and they start
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.060]   following that individual.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.960]   Which is what dogs do with us.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:03.720]   Actually, I would say that dogs don't imprint on humans. They grow attachment bonds to humans.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.620]   What's the difference?
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:10.540]   So imprinting is typically a very fast process. It occurs within, you know, minutes or hours.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:15.220]   Attachment takes longer and involves more senses. So imprinting tends to be, I think, visual.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:21.880]   If I'm not mistaken, perhaps olfactory in some species. Uh, and attachment has, has
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:28.700]   previously mostly been studied in humans. So this bond that grows between, uh, caregiver and
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:37.320]   offspring. Um, what's interesting also is that, that attachment bond, um, will grow in different
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:46.620]   ways depending on how the caregiver responds to the young one's, um, needs, um, needs essentially. So you can
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:56.740]   have, um, a secure attachment bond where the caregiver is very, uh, reliably responds to the needs of the, of the young
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:05.340]   one. So that if they find themselves alone, they can, they can self-regulate better. So they can,
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:13.540]   their nervous system can more easily calm down again, uh, after a stressor than if they are
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:20.540]   insecurely attached. And so it seems that dogs form rather than imprinting on humans, they form a type
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:27.160]   of attachment bond and they can also be securely or insecurely attached to their persons.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:31.900]   That's going to open up a whole set of ideas for people because this whole notion of secure
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:36.540]   and secure and, um, and then the D babies in the classic Bowlby experiments that we've talked about
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:43.240]   before on this podcast where, um, this kind of disorganized, um, responses is something that is
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:48.660]   thrown around a lot nowadays in a dating culture, relationship, pop psychology culture, like our
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:54.200]   people, is he or she securely attached? Is he or she avoidant? Is he or she anxious attached?
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:59.760]   Guess what folks? It's also in your pets. So now you can start to get into that. In those classic
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.940]   experiments of Bowlby, just to summarize very briefly, um, mother and it was typically mother,
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:09.140]   although other caretakers now have been tested, but mother and child are separated.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:14.860]   There's a, uh, a predictable, understandable and healthy anxiety response that occurs.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:21.800]   If the conditions are right, the kid eventually comes to play and relax a bit. If the conditions
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:27.640]   aren't right, they don't, that's all healthy. But the real test is on reunion with mom.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.900]   Yeah. And also how they respond to a stranger.
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:35.560]   Right. The strange situation test. Right. Do they feel comforted and how do they approach mom
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:42.560]   when mom comes back? Is it eager to see and relax? Is it uncertain? Is it, uh, avoidant? That's what
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:49.380]   the, this test is about. Yeah. Yeah. Or clingy also. Yeah. So the same types of experiments have
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:55.160]   been done on dogs and it's been found that certain dogs are, are sort of insecurely attached. They'll be
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:02.260]   clingy, uh, or, or avoidant and, uh, or some are securely attached. So they'll be sort of more
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:09.340]   explorative, uh, they'll recover quicker, uh, from the separation. So this is great. So if people,
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:14.820]   uh, drop off their dog at the dog sitter when they travel and then come back, the reunion tells you a
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:21.740]   lot about how that dog feels. Yeah. Sadly, I think that, that, uh, and, and I'm not sure that I have any
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:30.560]   back up in any scientific studies here, but I suspect at least that probably early weaning
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:38.440]   predisposed dogs to insecure attachment. In this country, the typical, um, idea is that puppies can
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:44.880]   be separated from their mother at about eight weeks. Uh, do you feel that's too early? Yeah. As an
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.880]   mythologist sort of looking, looking at how the species live in the wild, what type of social
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.440]   interactions they have and how can we best provide an environment to sort of promote natural behavior.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:03.960]   Uh, for me, eight weeks is way too early. So we have some studies from the, I don't know,
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:10.800]   sixties or something, uh, where I think two researchers called Scott and Fuller did some separation
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:17.000]   studies, but that, that was with dogs aged like three, four, five, six weeks. And they found that
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.580]   that type of early separation was really detrimental. Sure. Uh, but I, as far as I know, there's been very
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:29.380]   few studies done, done beyond eight weeks. And of course, many people would then say that, okay, well,
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:36.120]   we have to do all the, all that socialization stuff where the animal learns to sort of accept
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:44.160]   life with humans that would then have to occur at the breeders rather than in the new, uh, in the new
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:50.600]   environment. But actually I'm not so sure because it seems that if you have secure attachment,
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:46:00.340]   you're better able to self-regulate after, you know, being, being exposed to something that will
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:08.540]   so, so some, you have an event happening, you get anxious and, and sort of, uh, fearful and that
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:17.360]   then your nervous system is able to calm down again. And so I think that if we are, if we simply allow
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:26.160]   dogs to have secure attachment, then perhaps the need for this, sometimes this, um, the socialization
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.860]   procedures are very elaborate. There's like a list of a hundred things that the dog needs to be exposed
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:40.060]   to, you know, men with beards and children, uh, uh, age 12 and, and, uh, people with, uh, shoes, you know,
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:46.600]   certain types of shoes and, and, um, um, you know, the vacuum cleaner and so on and so on. There's a whole
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:53.260]   list of things that you need to expose an animal to. And I, I would think that if the animal is securely
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:59.800]   attached so that they have learned self-regulation, being exposed to those things will not be such a
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:04.040]   big deal. But I don't think that we have the research to back up that assertion quite yet.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:11.880]   I love this notion because, um, we can't prepare humans, including ourselves or animals for every
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:20.900]   circumstance, but we can, um, train up neural circuits. I'm a neurobiologist after all. And so I,
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:25.680]   I like to think of this more as, as opposed to preparing for events, you prepare for processes.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:31.100]   So, uh, you know, much has been said on this podcast and others about like deliberate cold
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:35.140]   exposure, you know, why take a cold shower? It's, it's not about the specific benefits of the cold
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:39.080]   shower. It's, it teaches you how to navigate having high adrenaline in your body, which is
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:46.880]   the universal generic response to stress. So, um, you can export self-regulation from one situation to
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:54.340]   the other. Um, what you're describing is a much more, um, important life stage example than deliberate
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:48:01.180]   cold exposure. It's about, as you said, being able to navigate, uh, attachments that are there,
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:06.700]   then gone, then there again. This is one of my major concerns. We don't want to, um, go off on a,
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:12.240]   on a tangent too far here, but since humans are animals, as you pointed out about, um, texting,
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:18.500]   you know, it oftentimes texting can be a wonderful tool. It also can be a way that people, um, don't
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:23.400]   learn to ever deal with their, to self-regulate. Yeah. Uh, you see this as the plane lands or the
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.940]   planes taking off people, you know, frantically, uh, texting, which can be about, Hey, my plane just
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:33.400]   arrived. It can also be about an inability to just kind of deal with the, uh, the real life
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.600]   uncertainty that you're not in charge up there, the pilots and the weather conditions are. So in any
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:48.420]   case, I have a probably controversial question, but we've opened up some Pandora's boxes. So why not?
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:57.540]   Um, I opted to neuter my dog. Uh, I did that when he was about six months old. I did that
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:03.200]   honestly reluctantly. People say, well, you know, men with their dogs and they don't want to neuter
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.660]   their dogs and it's for these, you know, whatever Y chromosome related reasons or something. Perhaps
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:15.200]   it is. Um, but really the reason I was reluctant was a, I thought I might want to breed Costello at
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:21.460]   some point. The other is I spent two years of my life, uh, studying and researching and, um,
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:27.680]   eventually publishing, uh, papers on the effects of, uh, early androgens on, I had a minor role in
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.520]   that study, but, um, effects of early androgens on brain development. And you don't have to spend
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.640]   long in, in that field of hormones and development to know that hormones, testosterone and estrogen
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:43.580]   have a powerful, powerful organizing effect on the brain of males and females.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:47.400]   So that also occurs during adolescence.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.000]   Right. And then there's the surge of, of hormone that comes. So right. There, it happens in utero
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.800]   and then, and then those are the organizing effects. And then there are the activating
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.420]   effects as you're pointing out of hormones that then during puberty, the ovaries in females or the
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:06.380]   testes in males produce hormones that then act on this kind of template that was laid down.
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:11.840]   And so I knew that whatever testosterone, estrogen, et cetera, Costello had seen in utero,
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:18.240]   he'd seen. And that by removing his testicles, let's be honest, what neutering is, all the men are
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.000]   cringing and the women are like, okay, got it. Um, but if I said remove ovaries, they might have
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:30.700]   the different response. So by removing his, his testes that he would not experience the, um,
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:37.160]   activating effects of hormones. Okay. Uh, to make a long story short, um, it seemed he had a great
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.940]   life. He was a wonderful dog. When he got to be about nine years old, he had a lot of joint aching
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:46.700]   and pain. He had some extensive nail growth that was really, really fast. Some things were,
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:55.780]   were odd. Um, I opted to do, um, an experiment. Um, and I started injecting him with 50 milligrams of
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:05.240]   testosterone per week. The response was incredible. His vigor returned his joint pain, at least in terms
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:12.260]   of his willingness to go down the stairs quickly, to stand up quickly. Incredible. He, um, got two more
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:19.360]   years of what I thought was a great life. I hope it was. Um, and what's interesting is that when I talked
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:25.040]   about this publicly on a few other podcasts, I injected my bulldog with testosterone after neutering him.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:31.500]   I thought I was going to get a tsunami of criticism from the veterinary community. Okay. Instead,
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:39.080]   I received hundreds of emails saying, thank you. We actually actively discourage people from neutering
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:44.080]   their animals unless they're in a circumstance where that dog can get out and mate because we don't need
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:51.280]   more strays. And there are a number of health, positive health benefits to keeping hormones intact.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.380]   Yeah. And I'm going to start doing what you did with some of my, my, uh, with some of my patient
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:03.080]   dogs. Yeah. Not one vet, mind you have no training as a vet. Not one vet said, hey, you were out of
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:07.120]   line doing that. You shouldn't have been doing that. And I'll tell you, if I get another dog and it's a
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.400]   male dog, I'll be very careful to not let him out. And I'll be very careful with the training. So he's
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:17.500]   not excessively aggressive, but, um, I'm not going to neuter him. And I know this is going to activate
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:25.680]   some people, but I'd love your thoughts on neutering in male and female dogs in particular. Um, given
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.300]   everything that you and I know about hormones and what we just talked about. Yeah. You're touching on
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:33.060]   several different things that I think are interesting. One, that it's a very much a cultural phenomenon
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:39.920]   that in Norway, I know that you're not allowed to neuter dogs unless for medical reasons. Really?
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:47.560]   Yeah. And in Western Australia, you're not allowed not to neuter dogs unless for medical reason or if
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:52.900]   you want to breed them. So it's, it's like very cultural whether neutering is something that you
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:53:00.600]   do or not in, in, in any given location. That's one. The second thing is that you said that
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:06.100]   neutering is about removing test, uh, testicles. Actually there's, there's other procedures that
[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:13.000]   can be done, which is, is essentially, uh, just snipping the connection. So not removing testicles
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:23.140]   so that they continue producing, uh, all the stuff that they produce, but they, um, uh, they can't,
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:27.300]   uh, produce, reproduce sexually. Yeah. Why don't we just give them vasectomies? Why don't I? Yeah.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:31.480]   So the second thing is, and for, for females, the corresponding procedure would then be to,
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:37.700]   to sort of whatever it is. Tie the tubes. Yeah. Tie the tubes. Whatever it is. Yeah. And there's also
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:45.100]   a third option, which is, um, chemical castration. That's, that's reversible, that you can try to see
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:54.440]   what behavioral effects you get from a change of, uh, hormonal status. There's also this interesting
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:54:01.400]   thing that the, the, the, the knowledge of the effects of castration or, or neutering has really
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:09.100]   changed a lot in the last 20 years or so. It used to be in the 1990s that, that it used to be recommended
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:15.360]   because, uh, you know, they wouldn't reproduce and there'd be less, uh, humping and, and, and some,
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:24.200]   uh, so it was sort of promoted with regards to certain behavioral changes. Later studies have
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:29.940]   shown, and there's like more than 20 in the last 20 years or so, have shown that quite consistently that
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:36.620]   some of the effects of neutering might be particularly in males, apparently. And it depends on the age at
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:41.940]   which this is done also. And it has to do with this, the activation process, of course,
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:50.640]   is that you see an increase in fear, uh, an increase in, in reactivity, aggressive behavior. You might see
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:55:01.900]   an increase in, um, uh, noise, uh, sensitivity and so on. So it seems that as you were touching on,
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:07.640]   the change in hormonal status not only has this physiology, the physical effects on the body,
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:14.760]   but also behavioral effects. Now there's also an increase in the risk of certain cancers or certain,
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:24.800]   you know, physical, um, problems and a decrease in others. So I would, I would suggest that once you
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.320]   do get your other, your next dog, that you discuss with a veterinarian the best option for that particular
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:35.080]   breed and that particular individual, because it's, it's going to be very breed specific,
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:39.040]   is gender specific. And it's also the age at which these procedures are done.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:45.420]   Okay. So to me, it's very interesting that in Norway, dogs are not allowed to be fixed except
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:52.740]   for medical reasons in Australia. They have to be at least in Western Australia. Um, so this idea of
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:56:00.140]   keeping dogs intact, so to speak, um, is not such a heretical one. Um, but I think in the United States,
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:05.120]   a lot of this is still getting worked out. And I think that the statistics say that the number of
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.580]   people with pets in the home now in the United States is, is like almost every home.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:17.060]   Yeah. I think it's a 40% of Americans own a dog. And I think in Norway, it's like 15. So,
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:24.400]   and I think probably this ties in a lot to why the cultures have emerged so differently because
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:32.940]   there's a lot less sort of backyard breeding and so on and, and feral populations in Scandinavia of dogs.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:40.580]   So we don't have this huge problem with overpopulation, um, uh, that you'll see in some other countries.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:48.820]   So, and I think that, that here, a lot of the, the neutering is done to control the population, uh,
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:55.540]   predominantly as a way to sort of try to reduce the number of animals, uh, sort of go into shelters
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:56.060]   and so on.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.580]   Certainly there are a lot of dogs in shelters now during the pandemic, people were adopting them
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:05.060]   like crazy. So it was actually hard to get dogs and cats during that time. I don't know what the
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:11.420]   state of things is now. Someone can put that in the comments. I really have one last category of
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:17.640]   questions, but it's a, it's one that you've sort of touched on from various sides throughout today's
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:24.480]   conversation. And that relates to humans as animals. You know, I don't think one can be an animal
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:31.700]   ethologist or a neurobiologist for that matter, um, who, you know, reads papers and does studies and,
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:37.720]   uh, on other animals, um, without at some point stepping back and making this realization, like
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.280]   we're, we're old world primates.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:46.420]   We're the best at technical technology development, you know, among all of the, the species. I mean,
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:52.960]   I don't think that's too much of a leap. Um, we're certainly not as good at natural camouflage,
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:58.620]   um, catching and killing things with our hands. We need tools to do this. So we have our strengths.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:04.040]   We have our limitations with respect to the other species. Is there anything in your training as an
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:11.240]   animal ethologist that, um, that, you know, causes you to reflect on human beings as, you know,
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:17.240]   particularly, I don't know, spectacular and particularly deficient in some way, like, or
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:22.020]   any, just any kind of musings about the human species, because that's a species we haven't talked
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:25.620]   about today. But I think a lot of what you're describing in terms of the breakdown of these
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:31.100]   sequence of behaviors, what, what makes us feel safe? Um, you know, one can't help but wonder,
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:36.560]   like what, what are some aspects of ourselves that perhaps if we thought about a little bit
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:43.140]   more deeply, we could really benefit from. One thing that leaps to mind is the extent to which
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:50.980]   cultural learning occurs in humans. For other animal species, they, they learn from, uh, you know,
[01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:56.980]   trial and error. If I do this, that happens. First that happens, then that other thing happens.
[01:58:56.980 --> 01:59:03.000]   So classical conditioning and, and operant conditioning, uh, tie into sort of forming
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.060]   the animal's behavior. They also have social learning. They watch someone else and look at
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:12.480]   what they do. You know, in this situation, I'm feeling a bit concert, uh, disconcerted watching
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:16.880]   you to see how you react. Oh, you don't seem to be that upset. Okay. I guess I don't have to
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:21.760]   be that either. Or you're interacting with that thing in that way. I'll guess I'll do the same.
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:29.880]   But it's like, the influence is from the, the animals that are closest to you and from your own
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:37.400]   personal experience. Uh, and we sort of stand on the shoulders of giants, we humans, because we can,
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:45.660]   we can read people's thoughts that are thousands of years old, literally. And so I think that's one of
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:51.740]   the biggest differences I think in our learning is that we used to be called man, the tool maker,
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:59.660]   as if tool making would be the, the thing that set us apart from, from other animals. Until Jane Goodall
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:07.760]   reported that she'd seen chimpanzees making tools, uh, to, you know, the termite fishing behavior that she saw
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:12.960]   where they would break off a twig and, and take all the leaves off and then sharpen it. And so that they could
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:18.880]   insert it into, into a termite mound and the termites would climb onto it and they could carefully extract
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:28.580]   it and eat the termites. So they made these tools. Uh, so, um, yeah, that would be, I guess, my reflect,
[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:36.380]   my first spontaneous reflection to your question. That's a great one. Um, frankly, this idea that,
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:42.220]   you know, in addition to our ability to build sophisticated tools that our ability to, um,
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:46.560]   stamp down knowledge. And I mean, knowledge is always shifting. So some of the things that we've
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:51.960]   been discussing today and that I've seen said with great conviction might be proven completely false,
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:56.140]   you know, a year from now. So that's, that's, I think the interesting thing about science is that
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:02.740]   we're always having to question our assumptions. All right. I appreciate you reminding us of that,
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.440]   that this is all a dynamic process. You know, it's, we, we can only do so much with this, uh,
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:12.580]   piece of meat in our skulls in terms of trying to decipher the world around us. But I do think that
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:19.740]   this, this idea of, um, this insight that we're unique in our ability to learn from things long ago,
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:26.120]   as stamped down things now that people could potentially learn from, um, not just in the present,
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:31.760]   but in the future is incredible. And, um, in many ways appropriate for where we're at now,
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:37.540]   which is, um, you sitting here educating us about the different species. And I, I want to, um,
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:43.360]   I really want to extend my gratitude for the, the work that you do is very unique. People by now will
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:49.240]   realize that you're, you're the animal ethologist, but you pay attention to real world experiments run
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:55.520]   in a diverse range of settings. Um, and it's clear that you have great care for the, all the species
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:59.860]   on the planet and how they interact. And you've also offered us some wonderful tools of how to
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:06.020]   improve the lives of our, our cats, our dogs, and to really hopefully make people, um, somewhat of
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.620]   ethologists of themselves and of their interactions with animals. I think that's, for me, one of the
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:15.720]   biggest takeaways today is to, to really people listening to this and watching this should really
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:21.540]   reflect, um, not just on, does the dog like to be pet here or there, but you know, how is it that,
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:26.900]   um, a certain behavior is showing up in an animal? What does that reflect it because of its natural
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:31.720]   lineage and, and our own and, and to really think about those relationships and trying to improve
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:37.260]   them. So you've given us tremendous knowledge for its own sake, practical knowledge. And again,
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:42.620]   there's just so much care woven into everything you do that you've shared. So thank you for traveling
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:47.160]   such a long way to, to share with us. Thank you for having me. It's been a great discussion. I
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.620]   think. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr.

[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:40.740]   haven't heard, I have a new book coming out. It's my very first book. It's entitled Protocols: An Operating
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:44.900]   Manual for the Human Body. This is a book that I've been working on for more than five years and that's
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:50.900]   based on more than 30 years of research and experience. And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:58.740]   to exercise, to stress control protocols related to focus and motivation. And of course, I provide the scientific
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:04.740]   substantiation for the protocols that are included. The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:10.660]   There you can find links to various vendors. You can pick the one that you like best. Again, the book is
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:16.180]   called Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body. And if you're not already following me on social
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:22.100]   media, I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. So that's Instagram, X, Threads, Facebook,
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:26.660]   and LinkedIn. And on all those platforms, I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:31.140]   some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:36.500]   information on the Huberman Lab podcast. Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:40.180]   And if you haven't already subscribed to our Neural Network newsletter, the Neural Network
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:45.060]   newsletter is a zero cost monthly newsletter that includes podcast summaries, as well as what we call
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:50.500]   protocols in the form of one to three page PDFs that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep,
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:55.540]   how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure. We have a foundational fitness protocol that covers
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:05:00.580]   cardiovascular training and resistance training. All of that is available completely zero cost.
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:04.820]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab in the top right corner, scroll down to
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.460]   newsletter and enter your email. And I should emphasize that we do not share your email with
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:14.420]   anybody. Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Carolina Westland.
[02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:22.980]   And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
