[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   You also have redeeming points and miles for travel through your credit card portal.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.500]   And that typically looks a little bit better than a statement credit, but it
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.180]   doesn't necessarily perform better.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.180]   And what I mean by that is a lot of times card issuers or some card issuers, at
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.240]   least, will offer opportunities to get like, let's say, 25% more for your points
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.880]   when you redeem points for travel through their travel portal.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.140]   And that looks and sounds good, but there's some opportunity cost involved
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140]   there where you're not necessarily getting the 25% more that you think you are.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.600]   So I don't necessarily love booking travel through the credit card portal.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.100]   Although there are times when it makes sense.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.840]   And I think it makes more sense for flights in general than for hotels.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.540]   Uh, and sometimes if you're booking a boutique hotel where you wouldn't have
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260]   access to a better price, otherwise, there are times when that can make sense.
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.080]   But generally speaking, I find the opportunities to get outsized value to
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.040]   be in transferring your points to the various credit card transfer programs.
