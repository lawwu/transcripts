[00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.840]   - Hi, I'm Ken Ham, founder and CEO of Answers in Genesis,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.080]   the Creation Museum in the Ark Encounter.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.040]   And I'm here in Legacy Lobby
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.080]   in front of the Ham Family Legacy Exhibit
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   at the Creation Museum.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.960]   And in this exhibit is my father's Bible right here
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.840]   with his notes in there, copious notes.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.660]   My father chose the New American Standard Bible
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.180]   'cause he wanted the most literal translation possible
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.560]   that was easy to read, to understand
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.360]   so he could study the scriptures.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.420]   I am thrilled that we now have the LSB,
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.480]   the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.260]   This is an update of the New American Standard Bible
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.080]   to faithfully represent the text of scripture
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.540]   to be the most literal translation that we could have today.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.120]   That's why I encourage people
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.640]   to use the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.400]   So make sure you get your copy.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.020]   Thank you.
