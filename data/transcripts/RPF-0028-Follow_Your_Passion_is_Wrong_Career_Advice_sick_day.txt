[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is Joshua Sheets and this is episode 28
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   of the Radical Personal Finance podcast
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   for today, Friday, July 25, 2014.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I'm calling in sick again on the show this morning.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   As you can tell probably from the sound of my voice,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I'm not quite really able to speak.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I could barely get out a whisper this morning.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   But I didn't want to leave you without something
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   thought-provoking for your Friday to take you into the weekend.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   So what I've chosen to do is today I'm going to play you
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   audio from a speech by Cal Newport.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And this audio that I've chosen, I found it on YouTube.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   You can see the link in the show notes.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And this audio that I've chosen is from a speech
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   that Cal delivered at the World Domination Summit
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   in Portland, Oregon.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   The World Domination Summit is a project by Chris Guillebeau.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And he brings together a bunch of interesting people
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   for a weekend and they talk about how to change the world.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   That's the best summary that I can give it.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Now I have never had the opportunity to do this
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and I have never had the opportunity to go in the past.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I would like to go in the future.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It just finished up.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   It was actually just a week or two ago, the 2014 version.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But I'm hoping that in the future that I am able to go.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Maybe next year. Maybe next year will be the magic year
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   because it just seems like what an awesome gathering of people
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   that Chris has put together.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I would encourage you to check out--
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   if you haven't read any of Chris' writing, you can find it
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   at chrisguillebeau.com.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   C-R-I-S-G-U-I-L-L-E-B-E-A-U.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Kind of the French spelling there.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   chrisguillebeau.com
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And he's written a book called The $100 Startup,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   which is a very useful book for someone who's interested
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   in starting a business but put off by having the money
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   to be able to do so.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   But this speech by Cal is basically,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   "Why follow your passion is the wrong career advice."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And Cal's written a book called So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It's an excellent book. I would commend it to you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You would notice if you listened to the episode--
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I think it was 25--with Jacob Lundfisker,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Jacob actually mentioned this book and mentioned Cal
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   as part of that conversation.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So today's speech is about 30 minutes long,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   so you can expect the show to be about 30 minutes long.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   If you have the ability, you're in front of a computer,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   just click through to the YouTube video and watch it on YouTube
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   if you'd like to see the visuals.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's nice to see him deliver the speech visually.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   However, there should be no problem.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   If you just want to hear the audio,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   there's nothing that he talks about that you need to see the video.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   But that's going to be today's show.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I hope to be back with you ready to go on Monday morning
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   for another week of great content.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Thank you for sticking with me while I've been ill.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   [music]
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   [applause]
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Chris has been doing a great job, hasn't he?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He's fantastic.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   [applause]
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Most of you don't know this, but during that last break,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Chris visited three more countries on his list.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He's really-- [laughter]
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   He's an amazing guy.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   His publisher is here.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We actually shared for a brief moment the same publisher,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   and I'm a little bit relieved that we don't anymore
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   because when it came to the marketing meetings
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   where you sit down and you give your plan
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   for how you're going to market your book,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   nothing made it harder than knowing that Chris was just in there
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   giving his plans for marketing his book,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   so you would show up and say,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   "I'm going to do some guest blog posts
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   and a reading at the local Barnes & Noble."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You know Chris was in there the day before with his plans
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   to go to the bottom of every ocean
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   and do a reading on Mount Kilimanjaro.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm glad I have left, and now I can feel a little bit better about it.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I'm here to talk about career advice,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and as Chris previewed, I want to push back
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   against some ideas that we have taken for granted
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and sort of assume are true.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I want to replace them with some more nuanced ideas
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   that the evidence suggests might work better.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   This is sort of my professorial approach to these type of questions.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I wanted to start with someone
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   who I think would be well appreciated by this crowd,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and that's the late Steve Jobs.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   In particular, I want to go back to the early summer of 2005.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   This is when Steve Jobs took the podium at Stanford Stadium
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   in front of a crowd of 23,000,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and he was there to give the commencement address
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   to Stanford's graduating class.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   This was a big deal.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Jobs did not give a lot of these sort of touchy-feely speeches,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   but he showed up.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   He may have been wearing sandals under his robes, which he was,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   but he did show up, and he gave his talk,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and by all accounts, it was a really good one.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Someone posted this unofficial video of it on YouTube,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   3.5 million views.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Stanford then released their official version,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   another 3.5 million views.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I would assume that the number of people in this crowd
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   who have not seen this video is very small.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, we could probably fit them in this sinister cage thing
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   right here that Chris set up.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   (laughter)
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I sort of assumed when I came here for rehearsal
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   that he was going to have an investment banker trapped in here,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   sort of slowly rotating around.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   (laughter and applause)
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Sort of disappointed.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   (laughter)
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So as most of you saw it, most of you know,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   he had quite a few interesting points in this talk,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   but there was one in particular that really seemed to get people fired up.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And that's when he said, "You have to find what you love.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So judging by the news reports that came out right after this talk
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and the early comments on YouTube,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   it's clear that people interpreted him there as saying,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "Guys, if you want to love what you do for a living,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   you have to do two things.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   First, figure out what you're passionate about,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and then you have to second, match that to your work."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Now we are used to this idea in sort of common slang.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We summarize it with the phrase, "Follow your passion," right?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And we say, "Follow your passion. This is what we're talking about.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Figure out what you're passionate about, match it to your work.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Things will be good."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Now Jobs, of course, was not the first person to have this idea.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You can actually go back, and I've done this,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and track its emergence in the American cultural conversation.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And here's my quiz.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Which decade in the 20th century did the phrase, "Follow your passion,"
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   first show up in the printed English language?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Which decade? What would you guess?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   [Audience answers]
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I heard a lot, but I heard the loudest was 1940s.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And that is actually right. I'm very impressed. Thank you.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   We have a cheater.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And kids, that's the lesson. You know, cheat.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yeah, it actually showed up in 1940.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It was in a play, a short play. It was a bunch of woodcutters.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's not used in career advice format.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   In fact, I would not recommend trying to base your life off of this odd play.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   But that was 1940s.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You actually don't see it being used in the context of career advice
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   until the mid-1980s, and then you begin to see it show up.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   By the early 1990s, you start to see full career advice books
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   written about this concept.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   By the early 2000s, people stop explaining it in their books.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   They stop trying to convince you it's good advice.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   They just assume that you know it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   They just assume that you think it's good advice,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and they jump right in to just trying to justify it.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Or not justify it, but give strategies for taking action on it.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So when Steve Jobs stood up there and promoted the idea
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   that you should follow your passion,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   this was not the idea's introduction.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It was the idea's apotheosis.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   We have this icon of American remarkable living
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   who is giving his seal of approval on this idea,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and this got people excited.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And I'm not surprised that it excited people,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   because if you think about this piece of advice, "Follow your passion,"
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   it is an astonishingly appealing concept.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It tells you a life, a working life at least, that you love
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   is not just possible, but it's very close.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You have to do some introspection to figure out what you're passionate about.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So you take a strength finder, you pour wax in the water,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and if it solidifies like a microscope, you should be a biologist.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Whatever you need to do.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   A little bit of introspection, doesn't take long.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And then you have to go find a job that matches that.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Now you're going to have to read some blog post that will inspire you first
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   to get your courage up, but then you go and you get the job that matches it.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Then you're passionate, right?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I mean, you could be here in this audience today,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   you could be miserable about your life, and by playoff season,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   you could have a Steve Jobs-like love for what you do.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Very appealing.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   But there is a wrinkle here, as Chris previewed.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And the wrinkle is, as it turns out, this advice is not only astonishingly appealing,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   but it is also astonishingly wrong.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And that's what I'm here today to talk about.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So I spent much of the last year
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   researching and writing a book that looked at a very simple question.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Why do some people end up loving what they do, while so many other people do not?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   This was a transition period in my own life.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I had just finished my very long career as a student, many years.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And I was in a sort of purgatory known as a post-doc.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And this is where, in theory, you're preparing yourself for an academic career,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   but this was a very sort of uncertain time for a couple of reasons.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   One, I was potentially about to do the only and last job interview of my life,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   since professorship could be a lifetime experience.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And more importantly, it was a very hard job market,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   so there was a very good chance I wasn't going to get this job,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and after all this training, was going to have to start from scratch.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So in a massive abuse of my post-doc contract,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I said, "What I'm going to do is go write a book instead,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   while they're paying me to do this."
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And I wanted to have an answer to this question,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   because I figured this was the time in my own life when I needed an answer.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So there's two parts in this book.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   In the first part, I make my case against why "Follow Your Passion" is bad advice.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   In the second part, I talk about what you should do instead.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And in here, I chronicle this quest I went on
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   to find people from all walks of life who do love what they do for a living,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and to hear their stories and look for patterns.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   What were they doing instead?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   So today, I want to tell you two stories.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   The first story I'll pull right from the first part,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   and we'll draw some lessons from the story
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   about why I think "Follow Your Passion" is bad advice.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   The second story we'll pull from the second part,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and we'll draw some lessons from that about what I think works instead.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Okay, so that's our game plan.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So I'll start with the first story, and I think we should pick up where we left off.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   We heard Steve Jobs' advice later in his career.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I'm interested in going back and asking the question
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   of how his own career actually began.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So if we rewind the clock back to a young Steve Jobs,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   who's about to go to college and is trying to decide,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   "What am I going to do? Where am I going to go to college?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   What am I going to study?"
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You would have found the young man who was certainly interested in electronics.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   He had grown up in Silicon Valley's wirehead culture.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   This was a culture where young men and women would tinker with electronics
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   much in the same way that the generation before would tinker with cars.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   That's what was happening around Silicon Valley at that point.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   So it was a hobby of his. It's something that he was interested in.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   But I'd make the argument that if you asked him,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   "Steve, what are you passionate about?"
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   he wouldn't have said electronics.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   He wouldn't have said starting a technology company
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   that's going to take over the world.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And we know this because of his college choice.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   He didn't go to Berkeley to study electrical engineering,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   which is what you would have done in that time and that place
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   if you were passionate about electronics.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And he didn't go to Stanford or USC to study business,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   which is what you would have done in that time and that place
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   if you were passionate about business or entrepreneurship.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Instead, he came up here to a college not far from where we're sitting today,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   an elite liberal arts school known as Reed College.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   He went there, he was studying Western history, he was studying dance,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and he started to dabble very seriously in Eastern mysticism,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   which had just made its way to the West Coast around this period.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   So he shows up to Reed College, he's studying these things,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   he's asking these big questions, he drops out pretty soon,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   he sticks around for a while, he wanders the campus barefoot,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   he's sort of like a campus celebrity, he eats weird diets,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   he's bumming meals from the local Hare Krishna temple.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Eventually he gets tired of being completely destitute.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   So he comes back to California,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and he talks himself into a night shift job at Atari,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   whose sole--one of the most important things about it
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   was that it gave him flexibility so he wouldn't be tied down.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   This was a period in which he went and spent several months
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   on a mendicant's journey in India.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   He was beginning to spend more and more time at the All One commune,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   just upstate, and became more serious about Zen meditation,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   frequenting the Los Altos Zen Center more and more.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So this was jobs during this period.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So where did Apple Computer come from?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Well, he and his friend Steve Wozniak, who he'd reconnected with,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   had started launching what I think is best described as a series of schemes,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   where they would cobble something together,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   maybe sell it out of the back of a car, make a little bit of money,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   keep the wolf at bay, keep food on the table
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   while Jobs was seeking and searching and tackling
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   these deep philosophical and spiritual questions.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And for lack of a better word,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Apple Computer came out of one of these schemes.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   They had been tinkering more whys than jobs on a circuit board
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   for what would become the Apple One.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   They took it to the Homebrew Computing Club.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   The geeks got all excited about it.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I say this lovingly, being a professional geek.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   They get all excited about it.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Jobs says, "You know, I think we can make a little bit of money off this."
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So he walks over to Paul Terrell's Byte Shop,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   which is this sort of pioneering electronics store over in Mountain View.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   The myth says he walked in barefoot,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   though we don't have evidence for that in the biographical record.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   But he walks to the store nonetheless.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   He brings in this circuit board, and he says,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   "Look, the geeks are excited about this.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   We want to sell you 100 of them. You sell them to the geeks.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   We'll all make some money."
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   So, Andrew Young, one of his first definitive biographers,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   actually did, through interviews, the numbers they had worked out.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And they said, "After he sells those, we get our cut.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The cost of manufacturing, me and Waz will make about $1,000."
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And this biographer goes out of the way to emphasize
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that this was a small-time idea.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Their plans were circumspect,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   and they certainly weren't thinking about taking over the world.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Paul Terrell, fortunately, had more vision than Steve Jobs.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And he said, "I don't want to buy 100 circuit boards to sell to geeks.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I want to buy 500 fully-assembled computers
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   with all the peripherals put in.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   I want to sell these like appliances,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and I want to pay you 10 times the amount
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   that you wanted for the circuit board."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And Steve Jobs, to his credit, said,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   "Ah, I think this is something big that I'm on to."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And they went, and they raised a little bit of money.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   They built these, they raised some more serious money,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   they incorporated.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Apple Computer was born out of that.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   So the point I want to draw from this story
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   is that I don't doubt that Steve Jobs very quickly grew
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   to be very passionate about what he did.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But it's also the case that he did not
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   simply follow his passion into Apple Computer.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He did not sit down and plan out in advance,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   "I want to start a technology company,"
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   and then go and try to make that happen.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   If you had gone back in time, if we got in a time machine today,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   we went back and we said, "We're from the World Domination Summit."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Six months before Apple Computer was formed,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   and we would have gone back and said, "Steve, you have to follow your passion,"
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   he would have ended up an instructor at the Los Altos Zen Center.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   This was the things he was caring about.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And I'm sure he would have been an insanely great instructor,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   and that the meditation mats would have been laid out
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   in a sort of beautiful but functional design.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   (Laughter)
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But these were the type of things he would have said he was passionate about.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So the lesson I wanted to draw from this story here
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   is that the path to a passionate life is also,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   or often way more complex
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   than the simple advice "follow your passion" would suggest.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   The person who I think said it better than me was Ira Glass,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   who's the NPR host of This American Life.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Great show, great show on NPR.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Innovative award-winning show.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   This is someone who loves what he does, very passionate.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But you can find this video on YouTube, it's great.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It's a video where three undergraduates sit down with Ira Glass
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   to interview him for his advice on how they can build
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   a really cool, remarkable life like his.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And the one young woman says,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   "So how do I know what I'll be good at?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   What do I do once I graduate here?"
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And Jobs looks at her and says,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   "Well, you know, in the movies there's this idea
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   that you should just go for your dreams."
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And you can see their faces light up.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   They expect this is where he's going to say,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   "And that's what you should do.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And I'm going to call your mom and tell her
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   that you're not a pre-med anymore," or whatever.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   You know, that's what-- you could see that expectation.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And instead he says, "Oh, I don't buy that."
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And their faces kind of fall.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And then he talks for a while about how hard it is
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   to get good at something.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   And really what they need to be focusing on now
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   is sort of persisting in the effort to get good at something.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And he sees their faces fall.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And at the end he says, "Really, the problem here, guys,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   is that you're trying to figure this all out in the abstract
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   before you go and do it, and that's your tragic mistake."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And I thought that was a poignant way of putting it.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   This notion that you can sit down there in advance
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   and figure out what's going to lead to a passionate life.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And the uncertainty and heartache that can bring
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   when you don't immediately love what you're doing
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   is a tragic mistake.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   So that's the first lesson I want to draw from this story.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   The second lesson is that we don't really have any reason
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   to believe that follow your passion
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   is actually generally good advice.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   So I'm a scientist.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   So my first inclination when I took on this project
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   was to study the scientific literature.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And there is a lot of literature on workplace happiness
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   and workplace motivation.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And if you look in this literature,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   you would think that you would find lots of support
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   for this idea because this is one of the most popular ideas
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   in modern American career thinking.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   But you can't.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   In fact, finding evidence that matching your job
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   to a preexisting passion is good is very hard to do.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   What you find instead is studies that point
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   in the opposite direction.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   So one of my favorites is by a young researcher
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   named Amy Rizinski.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   At the time she was a graduate student at Michigan.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   She took a group of people, a group of employees,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   that all had the same position.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   They all worked in university administration
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   just right at the same level.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   She interviewed them and she found out
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   that a third of them saw this position as a calling.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   So a third of these people were passionate about this.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It was an important part of their identity.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It was an important part of their life, this position.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   The other two-thirds of people did not.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Some of them just saw it as work.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And the rest saw it as a stepping stone in a larger career.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And they could take and leave what they were doing right then.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So what I like about Rizinski is that she then said,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   "I'm going to dive deeper and I'm going to try to figure out
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   "what's different between these two people.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   "What was different between the calling group
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   "and the non-calling group?"
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And what she found was that one of the largest
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   predictive factors of being in the calling group,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   if not the biggest predictive factor,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   was years of experience.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   The longer someone had this position,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the more likely they were to see it as their calling.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Which, of course, is a way more complicated story
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   than "Follow Your Passion" tells us, which is,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   "No, no, no, you've matched this job to what you were meant to do.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   "You'll therefore immediately love it."
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And Rizinski's saying, "That's not what I found.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   "There's something more complicated happening here."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Another study I like is by a Canadian psychologist
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   named Robert Valorant, who had developed this survey
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   that allows you to figure out what, if anything,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   is a person actually passionate about.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Not interested, but actually passionate about.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   He has this survey, and he takes it and he administers it
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   to 539 Canadian university students.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   He found less than 4% of these students had a passion
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   that you could realistically connect to a career.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Less than 4%.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Do you want to guess what the number one passion was
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   from among these Canadian university students?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   (audience) Hockey.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   It was a good crowd. It was exactly hockey, that's right.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   (laughter)
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And he was born in 1940, so you guys should know.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   That's right, it was hockey.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Look, it's possible that this university
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   had one of the most astonishing concentration of hockey talent
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   to ever be assembled under one roof,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and that they should all follow their passion
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   and field nine different NHL teams.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   But it's more likely that for 96% of these students
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   to tell them, "Figure out what you're passionate about and go do that,"
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   would have failed for them as career advice
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   in figuring out what to do right after school.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   So that's the second lesson I wanted to draw here.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   When you look through the literature, we don't have much evidence
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   that this is generally a good piece of career advice.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Okay, so that's the negative stuff.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Let's go to the positive stuff. Fine.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   That may be too simplistic, might not be what the research shows.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   What does work?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So as mentioned, I went around and I found lots of people
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   who do love what they do, and I spent a lot of time talking to them.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   This is actually one of the dirty secrets of being an advice writer.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Our actual number one skill we have--we don't talk about it much--
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   is the ability to find people and convince them to talk to us.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And that's actually harder than you think.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I've been doing this since I was 21.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   When I was 21 and I had my first book deal,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I had to go interview Rhodes Scholars.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And the way I figured out to do it
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   is you would actually read the news release from the college,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   you'd see who the Rhodes Scholars were,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   you'd then go search, typically the student newspaper,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and you would find the naming scheme on their email addresses.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Was it like first letter of the first name and then the last name?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And then you would guess at what the Rhodes Scholars--
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   you basically have to be a stalker to be an advice writer.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   (laughter)
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   So anyways, I was stalking people as I normally do,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and I tracked down a lot of these people, and we talked,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   and we tried to figure out what happened in their life.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And I was looking for patterns, and I found a pattern.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And not everyone followed this pattern,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   but it was sort of remarkably consistent.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And one of my favorite examples of this pattern
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   is the writer and activist Bill McKibben.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I think his story actually personifies it well.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So I want to tell his story, and then we'll look at it
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   and try to pull out some lessons about the pattern that he exemplifies.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   So he did something that I think is smarter than just following your passion.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So let's hear what that is.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So Bill McKibben's story we can pick up
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   as an undergraduate at Harvard University.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   So the thing about Harvard is that it's an extracurricular shop.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I mean, the grade inflation at Harvard is so high
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   that you can get an A- for spelling 9 out of 10 letters in your name
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   correct on the test, right?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   So you have all of these type As who are here.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   They're all very achievement-oriented,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   so they put all this energy into extracurriculars,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and they put down these extracurricular loads
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   that make our full-time jobs seem like we're idle.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   So McKibben shows up, and he's like, "Well, what am I going to do?"
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And he decides he's going to write for the Harvard Crimson,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   this sort of fabled student newspaper.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   So he goes, and it's hard, you know, it's really demanding,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   but he works hard, and he works his way up,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   he stretches himself, he gets better at writing.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   By the time he graduates, he's an editor at the Crimson,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   which is a big deal.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And then he gets a job at the New Yorker
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   because he's been an editor at the Crimson,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   and now he has much better editors,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   he's been recognized by some of the best writers
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   in American letters, and again, he's being stretched.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   He's not writing 10,000-word profiles,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   he's writing the talk of the town,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   but he's stretching, and he's working hard,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and he's getting better, and he starts to make a name
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   for himself there, and he starts to move up.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   But what I like about his story is the twist that comes next.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   So McKibben quits the New Yorker
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   just as he's starting to establish himself
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   as one of their star new writers,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   and he moves to a cabin in Vermont
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   to write a book on man's impact
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   on ecosystems and the environment,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   which, you know, 2012 in Portland is sort of old news,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   but back then, people didn't quite understand
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   the scope of this, so he goes to Vermont
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   with a book deal and a big enough advance
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   to live there for however long it took to write this book,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and he came away with The End of Nature
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   was the book he wrote.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And this was a big bestseller,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   but more importantly, it was an important book
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   in the environmental movement, and established him
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   as an important thinker and writer in this space.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And it allowed him to go on and have a career
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   living in a cabin, living in Vermont,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   but writing these sort of very cool issue books
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   around environmental issues and other types of issues.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He would come up with the ideas that were interesting,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   he would go around and research and write them,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and they would all be very successful,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and he was having a real impact on the world, too.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And I've only met him in passing,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   but I've read a lot of the interviews people have done with him,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   and it's fair to say that he's very passionate
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   about what he does, and he loves his life.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   So the question is, what lessons can we draw from him?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   What did he do, if it was not just follow his passion?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Well, the first lesson I would draw from McKibbin's story
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   is that he got good at something that was rare and valuable.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   In his case, it was writing.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   He got good, very good, at writing.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   It took him about a decade, right?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   He had to come up through the Crimson
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   to get to where he was, but he got very good at writing.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And this pattern is common when you study people like him
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   who love what they do.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   They tend to start by getting good at something rare and valuable,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   something that the outside world says, "This is valuable.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   You are valuable now to our economy, to our field."
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   The second lesson to draw here is that once he got good
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   at something rare and valuable,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   he used it as leverage to gain into his life
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   the type of traits that matter to him.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   So again, I'm extrapolating off of interviews,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   but given my somewhat obsessive stocking of Bill McKibbin,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I can say that the three things that I think matter to him
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   probably are simplicity in his life, autonomy in his life,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and an impact on the world.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Different people would have different answers to these questions,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   but that was probably what was important to McKibbin.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   So once he got really good at writing,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   he used that as leverage to get those traits into his life
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   by moving to Vermont and being in a cabin.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   He had simplicity.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   By being a writer of nonfiction books, he had autonomy.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   He comes up with the idea, and then it's, "Go write it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Send it back when you're done."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And he was writing about an issue that was important,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   so he had an impact on the world.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   He was having an impact on the conversation.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   So he used his ability as leverage
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   to gain those traits that matter to him.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Now, these two lessons come up again and again
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   when you study people like Jobs,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   and when you study people like McKibbin.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   But I'd like to point out that there are some pitfalls
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   that surround them that you have to be wary about.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   This approach kind of makes sense, but there are some pitfalls here.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   The first pitfall is that if you make the jump
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   to try to get some of these traits that really matter to you in your life,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   if you try to make that jump without something valuable to offer in return,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   your chances at succeeding go way down.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So if Bill McKibbin had dropped out of Harvard
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   to move to Vermont to write The End of Nature,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   he almost definitely would have failed
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and had to have moved back to Boston,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   or even worse, gone to law school.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   (Laughter)
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Because first of all, he wasn't a good enough writer
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   to get the advance that could pay for him to live there,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   and second of all, he wasn't a good enough writer yet
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   to write a book of such impact and importance.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It was important that he got good at writing first
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   so he had something valuable to offer in exchange
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   for these very valuable traits,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   like making a living with a simple, autonomous, impactful life.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Another example of this I like is a computer programmer I met named Lulu,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and she had gotten this job out of college as a QA tester,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   which is not the most glamorous of jobs in the sort of--
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   you know, in the pantheon of Google writing the Gmail app on one end
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and sort of cleaning the lint out of the keyboards on the other end,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   and being a QA tester is sort of more towards the--
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   you're basically pressing buttons and seeing if the software works.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   But what she did is she made herself rare and valuable
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   by learning Unix scripting and automating most of their testing process,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   saving them a lot of money, saving them a lot of time.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   And as soon as she got good at this thing,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   as soon as she had value in this company, she immediately leveraged it.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   They said, "We want to give you a promotion,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   we want to put people under you, we're going to pay you more,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   you're going to have lots of responsibility and stress,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and if you ever don't answer our email, we're going to panic."
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   This is the standard thing you do when you get valuable.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And she said, "Well, wait a second, you need me now.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I'm not interested in your promotion, I want a demotion.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I want to go down to 30 hours a week,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   which is the minimum at which I can still get health care,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   because I'm going to go get a part-time degree in philosophy at Tufts."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   She had value to use as leverage here.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   If she had walked in her first week and said, "This is boring,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I want to go on a flexible schedule and go get a degree,"
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   they'd say, "Well, how about you go to a zero-hour-a-week schedule
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   because you're fired?"
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   (Laughter)
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   So that's the pitfall that surrounds it.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Number one is that if you don't have something of value to offer
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   before you go for these trades, it can be damaging.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   The second pitfall, and they sort of work together
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   in a sort of insidious balance,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   is that once you actually are valuable to a field or valuable to a company,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   that is exactly when you're going to get the pressure
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   to stick on the standard path of moving up the standard ladder.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Suddenly now, people care about that.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   No one cares if you're outside of your parents,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   if you're a freshman in college,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   you say, "I'm going to go write a book," or something.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   But the editor of the New Yorker cares when they're rising star and you quit,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   because you're actually valuable to them at that point.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   So this is something I saw come up again and again.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   As soon as you were valuable enough to actually take control of your life
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   and the pressure crashes down to take the promotion,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   to take the more responsibility, to take the bigger house,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   to stick on the straight path,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I'm sure all the pressure in the world was on Bill McKibben
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   to work up to be a senior staff writer at the New Yorker,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   start writing those sort of Adam Gopnik-style books
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   that no one outside of the New York Review of Book Editor ever reads,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   but are very well respected,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   then get hired as an editor at some imprint or Harper's,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   then work your way up to be an editor-in-chief
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   and be mortgaged for your apartment on the Upper West Side,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and be successful.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And that was the pressure he was getting,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and that was exactly the point where he leveraged it.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So that's the second pitfall here.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   As soon as you actually have some control over your life
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   is when it's going to be the hardest to actually take that control.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   OK, so those were two lessons.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Third lesson I want to offer,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and this is often the most controversial when I talk about these issues.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   What you do for your work is much less important than we think.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   This is like a corollary of everything we've said so far.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Bill McKibben built a life he loved as a writer.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   I would maintain that there are any number of other paths
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   he could have followed
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   that would have led him to a life that he loved just as much.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   I argue what mattered for him was the fact that he had autonomy,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   that he had simplicity, that he had impact in his life,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   that he had these general traits that were important to him in his life.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   So he got those by being a writer,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   but what was more important is that he got good at something valuable
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   and used it as leverage to get the traits.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And any position, any field of pursuit
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   in which he could have got leverage and got those traits in his life,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I would maintain that he would be just as happy
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and he would love his life just as well.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And this was certainly the sense I got
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   with the people I interviewed who loved their life.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I got this sense that, look, it was these general traits they had.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   They're different for different people.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Different people want different things.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Some people want to be at the center of everything.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Some people want to live in a cabin.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Some people want impact.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Some people just want creativity more than anything else.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   This differs for different people.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   But the sense I got studying these great examples
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   was that it wasn't the specific work that mattered.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   It was these traits.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And the get good and then exchange that value for these traits
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   was the most consistent formula for getting those,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   the most consistent formula for loving what you do.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Now, when I give this advice, people often push back
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and they say, "Are you saying that, you know, any job I take,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "I can be, you know, just as happy?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   "I could be the guy at the zoo that shovels the elephant crap
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   "and build a passionate life out of it?"
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   No, I'm not saying that.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   But what I'm saying is that the threshold
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   that a position or a pursuit or a college major must cross
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   in order for it to be potentially the foundation of a life you love
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   is much lower than we think.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   It's somewhere between,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   "Is this, like, my one true passion that for some reason
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   "evolution has made my genes be wired for me to do
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   "and only be happy doing this type standard that we have now?"
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Somewhere between that and shoveling the elephant crap,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   in between, there's a threshold that's much lower.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And the way I define that threshold is that
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   if something is interesting to you
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   and if it looks like it will give you interesting options
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   if you start to do well in it and start to become valuable,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   that's good enough.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   That's all you need for that particular job, that field or that major
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   to be the foundation of a remarkable life.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And for a lot of people,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   there's actually lots of things that match this criteria.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   That's OK. Flip a coin.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   I would go so far as to say flip a coin.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Because, again, it's not the specific work that leads people to love it.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   It's not the fact that you're using the microscope
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   or that you're actually writing that makes you love that work.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   It's these general traits.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   If it's interesting to you,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that means you're going to be able to stick with it and get good.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   If it gives options to people when they get good,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   that means you're going to be able to leverage that ability once you have it.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And that's what you need.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   So to summarize my contrarian take on this queer advice world,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   my reason for you throwing Chris's book out in disgust.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   (Laughter)
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Chris's book is not--
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   By the way, it's a very smart book.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It has lots of disclaimers.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   We're in very much agreement on this issue.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   I think he's just being facetious.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Though I won't object if you want to throw out his book and buy mine instead.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   That's fine.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   He's made enough money. Come on.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Starving college professor.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   (Laughter)
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Is that not a thing?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Can I not get away with that?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I used to do the starving grad student bit.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   This is getting harder.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   But to summarize what I'm saying here,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   since the mid-1980s, that's 20 years or so,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   we've been dominated by this idea that if you want to be happy,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   you have to figure out in advance what you're passionate about,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and you have to match it to your work.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   You can actually look at this graph.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   There's a cool superimposed graph
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   where you can actually graph the occurrence of the word "follow your passion"
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   in printed American books.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   So as time goes on, you see this thing curve up
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and really shoot up in the '80s and '90s.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   You can put on that same axis American job satisfaction.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   (Laughter)
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   In fact, let's just graph job satisfaction among 20- to 30-year-olds.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   People have a lot of options in their life.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   You see that plummet down starting in the '80s,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   just around the time that "follow your passion" started taking up,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and you see it plummet down.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   In the last US Job Board survey,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   the rating among 18- or I guess 20- to 30-year-olds,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   their rating was the lowest it had ever been.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It was actually the lowest rating for any group they've ever measured
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   in job satisfaction.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   So my generation has grown up being told,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   "Figure out what you're passionate about and go for it."
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   That's what's important.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   It's one of the most unhappiest generations there's ever been
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   in terms of how much we like our jobs.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And there's other factors there, but I think it's sort of a poignant display.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Our 20-year experiment with "follow your passion,"
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   I think we can say has concluded and has failed.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   (Laughter)
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   (Applause)
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have the goal
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   of being passionate about what we do.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   In the model I gave you instead, my hypothesis--
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I'm going to use my professor's speak--
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   my hypothesis is the model that works instead is pick something interesting.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   If there's nine things that are interesting to you, throw a dart.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Pick something that's interesting.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Get good at something rare and valuable.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   While your friends are switching jobs nine times
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   because they don't love it in the first week,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   take advantage of that to get better, to focus down,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   to do the satisfying work of craftsmanship,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   of building up an actual ability.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Once you have it, that's where you apply the courage,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   at this point, to use it as leverage to gain the traits that matter to you.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   That's my new formula.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I will summarize it for you to bring it back to where we started
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   by saying, I guess the easiest summary here is,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   "Do what Steve Jobs did, not what he said."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Thank you.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   (Applause)
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   If you're looking for an exciting role in customer service,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   food service, or retail,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   connect with a job at the airport.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Get started in a role that offers competitive wages,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   consistent schedules, and fast-tracked management
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   while you work in a vibrant, exciting environment
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   where security is a priority.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   The airport has it all.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   You can have it all, too.
