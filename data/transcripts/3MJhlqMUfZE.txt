[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020]   The flighty app, it's really fantastic.
[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.880]   If you look at my home screen right now,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.080]   I put a fake flight on here just so I could talk about it.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.960]   They have a great sheet to show up on your iPhone
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.740]   when you're waiting for a flight,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.080]   so you could just kind of keep an eye on it.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.120]   When anything happens, I usually get an alert from flighty
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.360]   before I've even gotten alert from the airline.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.000]   Each flight, they give you an arrival forecast.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.040]   So it shows you like how frequently
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.920]   is this flight early, on time, 45 minutes late?
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.800]   Where's the plane coming from?
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.920]   What kind of plane is it?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.080]   They give you the detailed timetable of like,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   not just departs at 2.30 for this random flight,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720]   but taxi scheduled for 10 minutes.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.400]   It's gonna depart at 2.40.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.480]   It's gonna land at 11.07, gate arrival 11.22.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.320]   Here's how long it's gonna be in the air.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.680]   Here's my history on the route.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.560]   So I pulled up a random flight from LA to New York,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.360]   and it says, "Hey, you actually took a flight,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.360]   "United 82 from LA to New York on June 5th, 2010."
