[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Pastor John Dan in Salem, Oregon writes in to ask, "Why you hate fun so much?"
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Hello Pastor John, I have heard you disapprove of the concept of "fun" as applied to the
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   things of God before in sermons. I would like for you to explain more what you have against
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   this word, particularly in light of your acceptance of the often maligned word "happy" when
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   applied to the things of God. Why reject "fun," which can connote enjoyment and pleasure, while
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   accepting "happy," which is to many Christians a worldly substitute for God's joy? I'm feeling
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   confused by your lexical choices, and I know how highly you value the clarity of language.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   What would you say to Dan?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   My lament is only secondarily concerned with words, and is primarily concerned with a spirit
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   of levity or lightness. And I'm distinguishing levity from a robust, large-hearted sense
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   of humor. My lament is with a spirit of flippancy, jokiness, silliness, playfulness—a spirit
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   that is manifestly uncomfortable with serious joy, and only comfortable with chipper, upbeat,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   jolly feelings of joy. Language, particular words like "fun" or "happy," is not the
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   main issue for me. It is something much deeper than that that I'm concerned about. It really
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   doesn't matter to me what words a pastor uses if he walks out on the stage after the
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   first two worship songs that have been engaging a heart with the living Christ and says, "Howdy
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   church, y'all having fun?" It wouldn't help matters to me if he changed his language.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   "Howdy church, y'all happy this morning?" The issue's not whether the word "happy"
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   is okay or the word "fun" is okay. The problem here is not the vocabulary. The problem
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   is the heart. It's the inability to distinguish emotionally between the happiness of the glories
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   of Christ that we were just singing about and the happiness of a barn-hee-haw dance.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And the point is not that barn dance is bad. Good grief, it's not bad. There's a place
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   for the barn dance and the hee-haw. That's totally not the issue. The point is that there's
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   a difference. There's more than one kind of good times. Our people desperately need
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   good models of serious joy, not somber joy, but serious joy. I fear there's so many people
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   who don't have a clue what I'm talking about. All they can do is put this into the categories
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   of glum. I hope they're listening more carefully. They need to see, our people need to see in
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   their pastor the kind of earnestness about life and worship and ministry that is gloriously
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   happy in the child of God, happy that I'm his child, happy to be called into his service,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and gloriously able to show that and express that without borrowing from the same demeanor
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and the same vocabulary of a carnival or a talk show. So when I hear a pastor say about
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   his ministry, "It's great fun. We're having a blast planting this church. We're just having
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   a blast," I want to say, "Aren't you spending most of your time dealing with God, the tragic
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   consequences of the fall, the local and global realities of suffering and ministry, hell,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   heaven, the slaughter of Jesus on the cross, the resurrection, the bondage of the will
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   that you're powerless to do anything about in the people you love, the power of Satan,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   the preciousness of the Holy Spirit, the forgiveness of sins, the call to suffer, the hope of glory,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   the sweetness of Christian camaraderie, the privilege of ministry, the miracle of new
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   birth, gifts of the Spirit? How in the world does the word "fun" or the phrase "having
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   a blast" fit emotionally with those realities? Why don't those words "fun" and "blast" stick
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   in your craw? I think the answer is this. We are all, myself included, infected with
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   the vocabulary of entertainment, the vocabulary of amusement, infected. This is where we're
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   at home. We're at home with entertainment. This is our default vocabulary resource. This
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   is our native air. The vocabulary of earnestness and gravity and depth and weightiness and
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   substance, these are foreign. They're foreign. They make us feel awkward. They're not natural
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   to us, and that's my lament. That's my lament. It's not about words. We've borrowed the language
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   of entertainment to describe sacred, weighty, serious, holy joys, and the best thing we
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   can say to being an ambassador of the King of Kings is it's a blast. I regard that as
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   tragic, and not just a vocabulary tragedy, but a spirit tragedy, a life tragedy, a huge
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   loss in the Church and in life. Someone might object, and I can just imagine you're trying
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   to build up a wall again between the sacred and the secular, and we've worked hard, really
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   hard, to tear down that wall by the way we talk and the way we dress, and you're trying
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   to build that wall up again between the sacred and the secular. Now, my response to that
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   is why should the flattening out go all in one direction, from the spirit of sacred to
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   the spirit of secular, from seriousness to silliness? Why not the other way? We know
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   why, because emotionally we are at home in the language of the secular. We're at home
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   in the language of entertainment. We're not at home in the language of sacred and holy
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   things. We have torn—no, we haven't. We haven't torn down the wall between sacred
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   and secular. We've sold the store to the secular. So my longing is for a heart in me
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   and others that feels the words and expresses ourselves and feels the demeanor that corresponds
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   to the weightiness and glory and sacredness of the subject matter being referred to and
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   the activity being described. I long for a gladness and gravity, an intermingling of
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   gladness and gravity that are woven together in the life and preaching of a pastor or anybody
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   in such a way that sober careless people and sweeten the burdens of the saints. I want
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   careless people to be wakened by the sobriety of joy, and I want burdened saints who come
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   in on Sunday morning to have their burdens sweetened and lightened. And I don't think
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   the word fun and blast is a vocabulary that does either of those things. If anyone thinks
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   that I want ministers to become boring or somber or gloomy or melancholy, let me close
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   like this. Unbroken seriousness of a melodramatic or somber kind will inevitably communicate
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   a sickness of soul to the great mass of people, and rightly so. This is partly because life
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   as God created is not like that. There are, for example, little babies in mother's arms
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   or lying on the couch in the world who are not the least impressed with John Piper's
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   passion or zeal or earnest looks. They are cooing and smiling and calling for their daddies
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   to get down on the floor and play with them. And the daddy who cannot do this with abandon
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and joy and fun and having a blast doing it will not understand the true seriousness of
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   sin because he's not capable of enjoying what God has preserved from its ravages, the ravages
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   of sin. He's really sick. He's a man unfit to lead others to health. He's in the end
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   earnest about being earnest. He's not earnest about being joyful. The real battle in life
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   is to be as happy in God as we can be, and that takes a very special kind of earnestness
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   since God threatens terrible things if we will not be happy. So my lament is not a lament
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   about the word "fun." It's a lament about the loss of the capacity to feel and express
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   the fun of cotton candy and roller coasters at the fair with our kids and the tear-stained
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   joy of soul-saving ministry in the service of a crucified, triumphant king. There is
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   a difference, brothers. There is a difference, and it would be a good thing to use words
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   that help people feel the difference.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That is sobering and worth a lot of self-reflection, Pastor John. This is why I appreciate your
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   earnestness with the ministry and with language and with serious joy. Thank you. And thank

[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   every glory is saving glory. And to explain, John Piper will compare all other world religions
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and talk about how they compare to the living God of the universe. That's tomorrow. I'm
