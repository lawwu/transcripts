[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.120]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000]   Today, we are discussing ways to improve your fitness.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.740]   In particular, we are going to discuss tools
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.840]   that you can incorporate into your existing fitness routine
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.340]   that will allow you to make significant improvement
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.160]   without having to invest a lot of extra time.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.960]   Most all of the tools we are going to discuss today
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.400]   were gleaned from the six episodes that we did
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.240]   with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.160]   We provide a link to those full episodes
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.720]   in the show note captions, of course.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.120]   Now those episodes included a very large number of protocols,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.080]   everything from how to build a fitness routine,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.280]   how to enhance recovery, nutrition and supplementation,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.460]   exercises and routines aimed specifically at strength
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480]   or hypertrophy or endurance or building anaerobic capacity.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.320]   What I've done is to select key protocols
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.920]   from those episodes that I myself have started
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.640]   to incorporate into my existing fitness routine
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.240]   and that I think will be especially beneficial
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.420]   and frankly fun for you to incorporate
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.280]   into your fitness routine.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.760]   Now, a little bit later in this episode,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.860]   I review the key components of any fitness program.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.640]   That is the number and type
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.480]   of cardiovascular training sessions
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.840]   and resistance training sessions that are essential
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.320]   for everyone to include as a template or a foundation
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.120]   for their overall fitness program.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.520]   Now, a little bit later in the episode,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.480]   I will be sure to review what are the essential components
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.040]   of any fitness program.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.720]   So the number and type of resistance training sessions,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   the number and type of cardiovascular training sessions,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.280]   as well as some of the elements of how those are arranged
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.380]   to ensure proper and adequate recovery between sessions
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.160]   so that you can continue to make ongoing progress.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.920]   However, the bulk of today's discussion is going to focus
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.160]   on tools that you can use, again, very easily, very quickly,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.660]   in some cases, even saving you time
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.520]   during your fitness regimen
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.240]   in order to improve all aspects of your fitness,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.840]   your endurance, your muscular endurance,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.520]   your anaerobic capacity, your recovery, your strength,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.760]   your hypertrophy.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   And in describing these tools to improve your fitness,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.960]   it also provides an opportunity for each and all of us
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.600]   to step back from our existing fitness routine
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720]   and ask whether or not it's really checking off
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.480]   all the boxes that are necessary,
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.680]   as well as where we can be more economical
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.020]   with our time and our efforts
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.920]   in order to reach our specific goals
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   related to exercise and performance.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.600]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.520]   you can be sure that you have at least one
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.940]   and as many as 12 tools that you can incorporate
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.620]   into your existing fitness routine,
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.600]   again, without adding much additional time or effort,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.960]   that are sure to accelerate your progress.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.680]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.400]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.600]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.420]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.360]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.880]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.600]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.700]   the electrolytes, but no sugar.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.000]   Having adequate electrolytes is absolutely critical
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.280]   to cellular function, in particular, the function of neurons.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.360]   In order for your neurons to function properly,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.660]   you need electrolytes in your system
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.440]   and you need to be well-hydrated.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.040]   There's a lot of research to support the fact
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.640]   that if you are even mildly dehydrated,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.440]   that your cognition suffers,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.420]   your physical performance suffers,
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.080]   and your sleep can also suffer.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.420]   So getting adequate electrolytes and hydration is key,
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.160]   and Element allows you to do that.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.700]   I typically mix Element into 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.420]   and drink that first thing in the morning.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.540]   I'll also drink another one during exercise,
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.840]   and sometimes another one after exercise as well,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.260]   especially if I've been sweating a lot
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.840]   or it's a particularly hot day.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.000]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.800]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.160]   and that's spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.200]   And you can claim a free sample pack with your purchase.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.260]   Again, that's drinkelement, L-M-N-T.com/huberman
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.020]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.440]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.660]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.440]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.540]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.880]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120]   And I say that because when we are not sleeping well
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.340]   or enough, all of those things suffer.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.280]   Conversely, when we are sleeping well
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   and we're sleeping enough, all of those things improve.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.440]   One of the key elements to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.280]   is to have the proper mattress.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.580]   Helix mattresses are different
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.080]   because they are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.120]   So if you go to their website
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.620]   and take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.160]   they will match you to a mattress
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.000]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.440]   The quiz asks questions such as,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.340]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.620]   Perhaps you don't know, that's fine too.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.880]   Or do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.060]   Things of that sort that allow them to match you
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.400]   to a mattress that will give you
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.960]   the best possible night's sleep.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.180]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a few years ago,
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.600]   and it has vastly improved my sleep.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.260]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.800]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.240]   to take that two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.440]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.360]   You can also get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.780]   and two free pillows.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.020]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.360]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.800]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.080]   Let's talk about tools to improve your fitness.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.520]   Before we do that, however,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.680]   I just want to briefly remind everybody
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.860]   what constitutes a core or a foundational fitness program.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.560]   Now, what I'm about to describe is not for the athlete
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.480]   that's trying to just improve one aspect
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.360]   of fitness or sports performance.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.800]   So for instance, if you are a powerlifter
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.260]   and your main goal is to move more weight
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.720]   on the core powerlifting movements,
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.800]   or if you are somebody training for a marathon,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.680]   it's likely that your core fitness program
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.360]   will differ substantially from what I'm about to describe.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760]   However, the vast majority of you
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.020]   are almost certainly trying to have some level
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.680]   of cardiovascular fitness.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.780]   So the ability perhaps to run a mile or more,
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.840]   certainly to be able to walk up a flight of stairs
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.060]   without getting winded.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.480]   You almost certainly want some degree of strength,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.800]   the ability to perhaps pick up a heavy load of groceries
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.700]   and carry it in one arm
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.800]   as you carry something else in the other arm.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.020]   You want the ability to help move furniture.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.880]   You want the ability certainly to not injure yourself
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.760]   when performing daily tasks.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.640]   And perhaps you also want to be able to go out
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.500]   and play a pickup game of basketball or soccer,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.660]   or to go out on a long hike with the family
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.420]   without feeling so sore
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.520]   that you have to rest in bed the next day.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.080]   An optimal fitness program of the sort that was covered
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.220]   in the optimal fitness protocols episode that I did
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.000]   is therefore one that checks off the major boxes
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.920]   that science tells us are important
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.640]   for health span and for lifespan,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.340]   and that can also help us improve various aspects
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.580]   of performance and improve various aspects of aesthetics,
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.660]   whether it's fat loss or muscle growth, if we choose.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.500]   So without going into that program in a lot of detail,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.240]   the core elements of it are that it include
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.100]   at least 150 minutes,
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.980]   and ideally more like 200 minutes per week
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.900]   of so-called zone two cardio.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.600]   I'll talk a little bit more about zone two cardio
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.120]   a little bit later in the episode.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.700]   But zone two cardio is, for those of you that don't know,
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.540]   the type of cardiovascular exercise that you can do
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.540]   while maintaining a conversation without getting winded,
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.200]   but that if you were to push a little bit harder,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.060]   that you would find it hard to complete your sentences.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.400]   In general, zone two cardio is the sort
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.900]   that you can do while purely nasal breathing,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.100]   unless you need to talk, of course,
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.380]   it's perfectly fine to talk while doing zone two cardio.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.620]   And again, the scientific research tells us
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.380]   that we should all be getting at least 150 minutes
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.920]   and probably more like 200 minutes
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.380]   of zone two cardio per week.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.780]   Now, in addition to that,
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.020]   a foundational or optimal fitness program for most people
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.260]   is going to include anywhere from two to four
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.900]   cardiovascular training sessions that are separate,
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.860]   that's right, separate from the zone two cardio,
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.900]   as well as two to four resistance or strength training,
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.620]   sometimes also aimed at hypertrophy
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.940]   or muscle growth training sessions.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.100]   Now, we have to acknowledge that most people
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.860]   are probably not going to hit the upper threshold
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.180]   of all of those three things.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.040]   Most people simply do not have the time and/or discipline
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.580]   to get 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.040]   plus four resistance training sessions
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.540]   plus four cardiovascular training sessions
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.820]   that are separate from the zone two cardio.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.160]   As a consequence, the optimal fitness program
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.060]   that I described in that episode,
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.380]   and by the way, it's the program
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.620]   that I've essentially followed
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.140]   for the last 30 years or more,
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.180]   includes three cardiovascular training sessions.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.660]   So one longer duration,
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.900]   sort of typical endurance type training,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.080]   this would be a long, slow jog or a long hike,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.400]   one day per week,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.180]   as well as a shorter cardiovascular training session
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.620]   of about 25 to 30 minutes,
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.140]   moving a bit faster, getting the heart rate up a bit more,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.560]   breathing a little bit harder,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   as well as one very short cardiovascular training session
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.440]   that would fall under the category
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.880]   of high-intensity interval training,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.160]   things like sprints,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.900]   which don't necessarily have to be done running,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.280]   could be done on a rower, could be done on a bike, et cetera.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.320]   So three cardiovascular training sessions,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.760]   as well as three resistance training sessions.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.060]   I want to acknowledge that resistance training
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.280]   can be done with body weight,
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.140]   can be done with weights, with machines.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.740]   I talked about the differing virtues
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.420]   of one approach versus another,
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.540]   but nonetheless, three resistance training sessions,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.240]   one focusing specifically on leg training,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.140]   one focused specifically on torso training,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.320]   that's right, chest, shoulders, and back altogether,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.440]   as well as some neck training for important reasons
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.980]   that were mentioned in that episode,
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.860]   and then a third session
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.540]   that was aimed at somewhat smaller body parts,
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.260]   biceps, triceps, calves,
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.620]   and some other small body parts
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.340]   that tend to be neglected
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.720]   and that are important to train
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.060]   if one wants to encourage muscular balance,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.600]   both aesthetically and structurally to avoid injury
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.560]   and have excellent posture.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.680]   So those were the core elements
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.480]   of that foundational fitness program.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.840]   And I mentioned then, and I'll mention again now,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.160]   that that program is not a mandate.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.560]   It is not an absolute requirement for anyone to follow.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.140]   It was simply meant as a template
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.680]   from which people could evaluate
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.640]   their own existing fitness program,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.880]   perhaps modify it somewhat or a lot,
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.180]   or if you were interested in trying
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.160]   that specific fitness program, that you could do that.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.560]   And we have provided a link
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.480]   both to that episode in the show note captions,
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.040]   but we've also provided a link to a table or chart
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.940]   that describes that foundational fitness program.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.840]   It provides examples of different cardiovascular training
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.920]   and resistance type training sessions,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.520]   and it describes some potential exercises
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.360]   and the rationale for those exercises
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.040]   and the rationale for selecting
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.780]   particular repetition ranges and rest between sets.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.640]   All of that information is available completely, zero cost.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.040]   You don't even need to sign up for anything.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.720]   You simply go to the link
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.440]   that we provided in the show note captions,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.900]   and there's a downloadable PDF there for you to explore.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.560]   Now, in addition to the solo episode
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.260]   that I did about optimal fitness protocols,
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.940]   we did a six-episode guest series with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.820]   who is a professor of physiology at Cal State Fullerton
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.200]   and a world expert in all aspects
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.480]   of exercise and muscle physiology.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.760]   That episode described a lot of the science
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.400]   and in particular science-backed tools
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.360]   for improving everything from long distance endurance
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.600]   to anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy, speed,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.000]   power, recovery, nutrition, supplementation,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.800]   and ways to develop a year-long program
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.400]   that will ensure you ongoing progress.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.360]   In that series, Dr. Andy Galpin provided
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.400]   an enormous amount of valuable information
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.200]   such that anyone and everyone,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.480]   meaning the person who's just interested
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.080]   in starting a fitness program
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.760]   or improving their existing fitness program,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.280]   or the elite athlete who's interested
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.340]   in improving their sprint times or their jump height
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.100]   or their powerlifting or their marathon time,
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.080]   could clearly benefit from some or all of the protocols
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.560]   that he described.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.480]   Now, because that series is so extensive
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.240]   in terms of its depth and breadth,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.300]   again, providing so much value at zero cost,
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.580]   thanks to Dr. Andy Galpin's expertise,
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.100]   but at the same time, because it might be
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.760]   a little bit intimidating for many people out there
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.120]   to try and figure out which protocols to incorporate
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.160]   into their existing fitness regimen,
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.560]   I thought it would be fun and very beneficial
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.440]   to talk about some of the key tools
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.520]   that were described throughout that series
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.120]   that one could consider incorporating
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.800]   into their existing fitness routine now.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.220]   So that's what this episode is really about.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.500]   It's about the tools that I personally glean
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.640]   from those discussions and that I found
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.340]   to be of tremendous value in improving
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.220]   both my cardiovascular fitness,
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.360]   my strength and hypertrophy training,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.160]   my recovery, and other aspects
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.500]   of my overall fitness protocols.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.440]   And when I say beneficial,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.920]   I mean in terms of improving my cardiovascular fitness,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.400]   improving my strength and hypertrophy training,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.440]   and that have improved the various metrics
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.080]   of fitness, lifespan, and healthspan,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.360]   which include things like heart rate variability,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.840]   resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.340]   as well as some of the fitness metrics
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.680]   that were described during that episode series
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.580]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, such as performance metrics,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.960]   the ability to jump a certain distance,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.160]   the ability to run a certain speed
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.080]   or to run a certain distance at a given speed,
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.780]   the ability to move weights in good form
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.020]   for a certain number of repetitions.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.420]   Again, all of the metrics of performance and health
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.840]   are going to vary tremendously from person to person,
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.800]   depending on where you're starting,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.160]   how long you've been training,
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.820]   and other aspects of your health.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.000]   The tools described in today's episode
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.520]   are designed for everybody.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.700]   Again, these are simple tools
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.720]   that you can put into your existing routine
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.640]   that should really move the needle forward
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.500]   in terms of improving your overall levels
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.860]   of fitness and health.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.080]   Okay, let's talk about the tools to improve your fitness.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.260]   The first tool is to mesh your zone two cardio
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.400]   with your daily activities.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.340]   So for those of you that don't know,
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.040]   zone two cardio is the type of movement
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.160]   that we typically call cardio exercise
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.300]   that elevates your heart rate somewhat,
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.600]   increases your breathing somewhat,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.360]   but that still allows you to carry out a conversation
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.720]   without having to pause or to gasp
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.460]   in order to complete your sentences, okay?
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.600]   So that's a general rule of thumb for zone two cardio.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.460]   Now, for those of you that use a fitness tracker,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.740]   you can monitor whether or not
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.720]   you are in zone two cardio very precisely,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.520]   but if you're like me and you don't use a fitness tracker,
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.780]   it's very easy to know if you're in zone two cardio,
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.640]   because again, it's that level of output
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.540]   that puts you right below or somewhat below the threshold
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.420]   where if you were to exert yourself with any more intensity
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.400]   that you wouldn't be able to complete your sentences.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.320]   Now, this could of course be evaluated
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.880]   by jogging with someone or walking with someone
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.060]   or hiking with someone and carrying out a conversation.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.320]   If somebody isn't available,
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.240]   you could of course do this by trying to speak out loud
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.640]   and have a conversation with yourself.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.940]   Or if you want another way to monitor
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.320]   whether or not you're in zone two cardio
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.280]   without having to use a fitness tracker,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.840]   you could simply ask yourself
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.480]   whether or not you are maintaining a level of output
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.020]   that increases your heart rate and your breathing,
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.060]   but that allows you to maintain purely nasal breathing
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.600]   the entire time.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   Any of those approaches will tell you more or less
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.780]   whether or not you're in zone two cardio.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.840]   Now, the scientific data tell us
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.240]   that we should all be getting anywhere from 150 minutes
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   to 200 minutes per week minimum of zone two cardio
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.560]   for sake of cardiovascular health, cerebrovascular health,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.960]   and a number of other aspects of health
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.840]   that are important essentially to everybody
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.320]   for healthspan and lifespan.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.240]   Now, many people including myself schedule zone two cardio
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.560]   into their weekly fitness regimen.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.580]   So for me, I have one day a week.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.000]   For me, it falls on a Sunday where I go out for a jog
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.760]   that lasts anywhere from 60 minutes to 90 minutes.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.120]   It's a slow jog.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.240]   I can maintain nasal breathing the entire time
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.860]   or have a conversation with somebody else or myself
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.400]   the entire time if I like.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.080]   Or sometimes it consists of a hike by myself
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.640]   or with other people.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.480]   And sometimes those hikes extend anywhere from an hour
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.880]   to four hours depending on the circumstances, et cetera.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.420]   I will mention that whenever possible,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.320]   I try and do that once a week zone two cardio session
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.160]   out of doors because I like being in nature
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.420]   and I like getting sunlight and I like getting fresh air.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.080]   Now, during the discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.600]   I explained how I get my zone two cardio
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.480]   and I acknowledged that that once a week session
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   doesn't always allow me to reach that 150 minute
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   to 200 minute minimum threshold of zone two cardio per week.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.240]   Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.440]   And his response to that was very reassuring.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.360]   What he said was, "Look, if you want to schedule
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.800]   "zone two cardio and head out for a long Sunday jog
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.540]   "or hike, terrific.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.580]   "If you want to schedule zone two cardio
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.780]   "as two or more sessions on the treadmill or on the bike,
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.880]   "great."
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.760]   But that he doesn't actually think of zone two cardio
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.920]   as exercise at all.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.640]   And to that I gasped and then I was a little bit deflated.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.660]   I thought, "Oh, great, I'm doing all this zone two cardio
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.960]   "and you don't even consider that exercise."
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.000]   And then when he said it was very reassuring
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.280]   and I think it's going to be very reassuring to all of you,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.600]   he said, "First of all, zone two cardio
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.440]   "is absolutely critical to our health
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.120]   "for a number of reasons that I already mentioned.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.300]   "But in addition to that, zone two cardio does not impede
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.040]   "and in fact can enhance our other aspects of fitness."
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.560]   So for example, our strength training,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.100]   our hypertrophy training or any type of speed work
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.760]   or other types of cardiovascular training one might do.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.300]   And that the best way to get zone two cardio is okay,
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.240]   if you want to schedule it, schedule it as a session,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.760]   but that to simply increase the amount of walking
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.360]   and in particular walking at a rapid pace that one does
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.220]   and to increase the total amount of movement
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.440]   that one's getting throughout the week.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.800]   So taking groceries in and out of the grocery store,
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.360]   running around with the kids,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.480]   taking a walk with a coworker while having a work discussion,
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.780]   taking your calls for work while pacing in the office
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.920]   or going outside.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.140]   What he impressed on me is that zone two cardio
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.380]   can be meshed throughout the daily activities
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.160]   that I and everybody else generally have to do.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.880]   And this was of great relief to me
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.000]   because I, as many of you are, am extremely busy.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.160]   I don't have time to schedule in more cardio per week,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.840]   or at least I don't see the way I could do that
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.660]   without reducing the amount of sleep that I'm getting
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.440]   or without reducing the amount of social connection
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.780]   that I'm getting with family and friends,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.440]   both of which are extremely important
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.480]   to our mental health and physical health.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.740]   So the basic tool here is, yes, get 200 minutes per week,
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.500]   minimum of zone two cardio.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.740]   And notice I said 200 minutes,
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.700]   not 115 minutes to 200 minutes.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.340]   I'm going to set the higher threshold
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.180]   of 200 minutes per week, minimum of zone two cardio,
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.420]   but that you don't need to schedule that
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.460]   as time on the treadmill.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.040]   If you want to, great.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.880]   But what was communicated to me from Dr. Andy Gallopin
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.280]   is that zone two cardio is immensely beneficial.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.480]   It's not going to impede,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.720]   and in fact, it's going to improve other aspects of fitness,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.980]   and that it does not have to impede,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.440]   and it in fact can improve other aspects of our daily life,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.540]   like our ability to engage socially,
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.460]   our ability to have a great output at work
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.360]   in whatever type of work you do.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.940]   So the message is very simple.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.040]   Get 200 minutes or more of zone two cardio per week.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.520]   And the message is also a very reassuring one,
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.340]   which is that that zone two cardio
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.700]   can be spread throughout your daily activities,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.860]   and that if you're doing enough of it,
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.520]   you probably don't even have to count
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.860]   the total amount of zone two cardio that you're getting.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.820]   If you simply make the effort to move around a lot more
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.780]   during your daily activities,
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.020]   and to mesh that zone two cardio with your daily activities,
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.220]   you're going to hit that threshold
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.360]   of 200 minutes per week, minimum.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.320]   Now that's a great message for me,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.940]   because I'm already doing
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.860]   the three resistance training workouts per week.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.840]   I'm doing what now I can just call the two other
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.560]   cardiovascular training workouts per week,
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.260]   because now I don't even count that long Sunday jog
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.880]   or Sunday hike as exercise.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.600]   I just consider that movement out of doors on the weekend.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.520]   And in doing so,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.160]   it's also allowed me to really enjoy that a lot more.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.060]   There's something about considering something,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.880]   a fitness training program,
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.120]   that shifts it from just recreation
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.220]   and enjoying life to training.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.840]   And I of course love training.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.000]   I love training in the gym and I love training out of doors.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.620]   I love running, I love lifting weights.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.680]   I love all sorts of physical training.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.220]   I know many people do, I know many people don't,
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.920]   but if one looks at zone two cardio
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.020]   as just part of their daily life,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.640]   you're far more likely to get that zone two cardio in
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.240]   and all the benefits that come with it.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.400]   And you're also opening up time for work,
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.200]   for social engagements,
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.440]   and to do and pay attention to other aspects of fitness,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.240]   which is what we're going to talk about next.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.720]   The second tool that I've incorporated
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.240]   into my fitness regimen,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.780]   and that I believe can be of great benefit
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.720]   to frankly everybody,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   is to start including low repetition, pure strength work.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.440]   Now, some of you may already be doing
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.000]   low repetition, pure strength work,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.740]   but I believe that most people don't.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.500]   Most people who do resistance training
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.400]   are using either machines or free weights
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.220]   or some combination of those,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.260]   or perhaps are using body weight.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.300]   And they tend to focus on repetition ranges
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   from about five and usually more like six repetitions
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.240]   out to about 10 and perhaps 15 repetitions.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.080]   Now, of course, doing resistance training
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.200]   in repetition ranges of five to 15 reps per set,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.960]   provided it's done at sufficient intensity,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.400]   so either to failure or close to failure,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.800]   of course, in good form,
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.340]   is tremendously beneficial.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.320]   It can help build strength.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.240]   It can enhance hypertrophy.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.440]   There is tremendous value
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.760]   to training in those repetition ranges.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.860]   But when I sat down with Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.520]   to discuss resistance training specifically,
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.080]   he made it very clear that at least for some portion
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.560]   of one's yearly training cycle,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.020]   so perhaps eight weeks or 10 weeks,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.880]   or in the case that I adopted, 12 weeks,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.400]   there is tremendous benefit to training
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.320]   in the three to five repetition range and maybe even lower.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.100]   So the second tool of training specifically for strength
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.720]   in this three to five repetition range
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.780]   is something that I started to incorporate
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.280]   after I sat down to record that series.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.400]   And I'll just tell you a few of the benefits
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.360]   that I've experienced,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.160]   and then I'll tell you the specific protocol
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.980]   that makes it very easy to do this.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.360]   The most obvious benefit to me was that I got much stronger
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.200]   and that that strength persisted
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.480]   such that when I went back to using higher repetition ranges,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.600]   so typically I trained with weights or machines
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.520]   in the six to 10 repetition range,
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.760]   sometimes a little higher, sometimes a little lower,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.620]   but never before had I specifically trained
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.440]   in the three to five repetition range exclusively
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.720]   for a period of 10 to 12 weeks.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.120]   And when I did that, I of course gained strength,
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.340]   but that strength stayed with me
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.680]   such that when I returned to higher repetition ranges,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.680]   I could use more weight in good form,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.380]   and that of course enhanced strength
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.240]   and hypertrophy further.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.200]   In addition, there was another effect
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.560]   that was at least to me very unexpected,
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.140]   which was that my cardiovascular training
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.880]   improved significantly.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.720]   Now, why would this be?
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.000]   Because typically a three to five repetition set
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   does not elevate the heart rate for long enough
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.260]   that you would consider it cardiovascular training.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.100]   And of course the rest periods between those sets
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.300]   is pretty long as well.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.780]   So even if heart rate goes up during those heavy sets,
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.500]   it's going to go down during those long
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.360]   three to five minute rest periods between those sets.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.720]   But what I noticed was that my overall posture
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.540]   and my ability to maintain cardiovascular output
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.960]   while using good running form or good rowing form
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.980]   was also vastly improved.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.860]   And the logical interpretation of why that would be
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.100]   is simply that the muscles got stronger
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.020]   and those same muscles are being incorporated
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.740]   into the cardiovascular, let's call it endurance work
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.100]   that I'm doing on other days.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.900]   And therefore I can carry out
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.060]   those cardiovascular training sessions
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.220]   in better form for longer periods of time.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.900]   I actually felt much stronger
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.820]   during my cardiovascular training
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.740]   as I got much stronger moving these heavier weight loads
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.620]   for low repetition sets.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.340]   And then the third specific benefit that I noticed
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.040]   is that when training heavy for three to five repetitions
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.180]   per set, I didn't get sore.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.680]   And this to me was an incredible benefit
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.960]   because typically when I train in the six repetition
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.540]   to 15 repetition range,
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.460]   and I take those sets to failure or near failure,
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.260]   I do experience some soreness the next day.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.540]   Ordinarily that soreness isn't so intense
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.740]   that it prevents me from doing
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.940]   any of the other sorts of workouts that I do.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.380]   And for those of you that have visited
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.160]   that foundational fitness protocol,
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.000]   you know that I hit each major and minor muscle group
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.540]   once per week directly,
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.660]   as well as once per week indirectly.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.180]   That's the overall structure of that program
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.260]   in order to allow sufficient recovery
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.980]   between those resistance training workouts
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.320]   to be able to make continual progress.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.280]   Now, by training in this three to five repetition range
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.860]   that Dr. Andy Gallopin suggested,
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.380]   I was able to improve my strength,
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.320]   improve my cardiovascular output, reduce soreness.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.020]   I also just felt better overall.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.020]   I had a lot more energy after those workouts
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.460]   than I typically do after my resistance training sessions
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.480]   when I use higher repetition ranges.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.840]   There are just a number of different things
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.120]   that made me feel, wow, this is really a powerful protocol.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.800]   And of course, moving heavier weights in the gym
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.960]   feels good too.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.140]   It feels good to get stronger.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.400]   At least there's a positive feedback there for me,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.780]   and I think for most people.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.060]   And I should also mention that for those of you
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.420]   that are averse to doing heavier resistance training
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.200]   in this three to five repetition range,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.640]   because you fear that it will make you too big or too bulky,
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.360]   training in the low repetition ranges
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.580]   is actually more geared towards increasing strength
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.600]   and is shifting away somewhat
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.060]   from increasing hypertrophy or muscle size.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.260]   So that's a great benefit for those of you
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.560]   that want to be strong
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.040]   and also want to maintain cardiovascular fitness,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.920]   but you don't want to add muscular size.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.180]   And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.000]   it's well-established that increasing your strength
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.760]   will allow you then to return to patterns
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.720]   of hypertrophy training
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.640]   that will allow you to use heavier weights
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.440]   and therefore induce greater hypertrophy.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.040]   So there are oh so many reasons
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.760]   to incorporate these strength training protocols.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.600]   So the way that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested one do it
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.800]   and it was the way that I did it
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.320]   is to use this three by five protocol.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.280]   The three by five protocol is very straightforward.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.200]   It involves doing three to five exercises per workout, okay?
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.860]   So if it's a workout for legs, it's three to five exercises.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.520]   If it's a workout for some upper body muscle,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.200]   it's three to five exercises.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   Three to five exercises for three to five sets per exercise,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.800]   three to five repetitions per set,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.760]   and three to five minutes of rest between each set.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.360]   In addition, he emphasized that one can do those workouts
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.340]   three to five times per week.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.340]   Although I'm going to put an asterisk
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.040]   next to that last statement
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.440]   because I found that I couldn't do the three by five protocol
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.120]   say for legs specifically three to five times per week.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   I realize that might be possible for some people,
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   but I'm somebody who like many of you out there
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.920]   either doesn't have the time
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   or doesn't have the recovery capacity
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.120]   to train my legs three to five times per week.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.420]   Even though I acknowledge that there are probably ways
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.740]   to do that that would still allow me to recover,
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.180]   it just simply starts to impede
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.500]   into other areas of training.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.720]   It starts to impede other areas of life
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.400]   like work and family and sleep and all the rest.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.720]   So what I did and what I'm suggesting you try
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.000]   is for any existing resistance training that you're doing
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.620]   to take a period of eight or 10 or ideally 12 weeks
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.640]   and do the vast majority,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.440]   if not all of that resistance training
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.200]   in the lower repetition range
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.240]   that's designed specifically to induce strength adaptations
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.860]   and to not pay attention to whether or not
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.600]   you're hitting that same muscle group
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.400]   three to five times per week.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.240]   Rather if you train your legs once or twice per week
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.360]   to simply do all of the work for your legs
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.480]   in that three to five repetition range.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.120]   If you train an upper body muscle or muscle groups,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.280]   chest, shoulders, back once per week or twice per week
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.340]   to just stay within that three to five repetition range
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.380]   for those work sets, right?
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.420]   Warmups can include a few more reps.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.440]   And then to adhere to this three to five exercises,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.680]   three to five sets per exercise,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.720]   three to five repetitions per set
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.380]   and three to five minutes between sets.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.720]   Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.920]   was that for very small muscle groups.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.800]   So for instance, the rear deltoids or for neck work
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.040]   or for calf work to not rely purely
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.480]   on three to five repetitions,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.600]   but maybe to work in a range of anywhere
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.640]   from five to eight repetitions.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.580]   So still fairly low repetitions,
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.200]   but not so low that it restricts you
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.600]   to three to five repetitions.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.720]   The reason for that is that I,
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.160]   and I think a lot of people out there find it hard
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.760]   to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.120]   with good form when restricting oneself
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.720]   to those low repetitions.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.580]   However, for big compound movements like presses and squats
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.520]   and deadlifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.120]   maybe even leg extensions and leg curls,
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.440]   which are isolation exercises, of course,
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.400]   to really restrict oneself to those
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.200]   three to five repetition ranges
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.720]   that take you to failure or near failure.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced,
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.960]   and I'm confident that you will also experience
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.120]   a lot of benefits.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.340]   So just to remind you what some of those benefits are,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.720]   you get stronger, which feels great.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.580]   That occurs within your weight workouts,
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.040]   but it also carries over
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.800]   to your endurance training sessions.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.240]   I also noticed that when returning to higher repetitions
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.560]   for resistance training,
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.160]   so after 12 weeks,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.720]   shifting away from three to five repetition ranges
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.800]   and going back to training in the six to 10 repetition
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   ranges mainly, occasionally up to 12 or 15,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.140]   but really mainly restricting to six to 10 repetitions,
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.800]   that you can move much heavier weights in good form
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.600]   and thereby induce more hypertrophy
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.040]   while still also continuing to gain some strength.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.960]   And another benefit was, again,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.860]   reduced soreness compared to when training
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.580]   with higher repetition ranges and more mental freshness,
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.360]   is I guess the only way to describe it,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.160]   when training in those lower repetition ranges.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.000]   I don't know about you,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.960]   but when I finish a really hard hour long
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.120]   resistance training session
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.140]   done in the six to 12 repetition range,
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.880]   there's a certain type of mental fatigue
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.960]   that even if I eat properly afterwards,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.660]   even if I hydrate properly,
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.800]   that it tends to sap a bit of my mental energy
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.920]   later in the day,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.520]   but that the training at the three to five repetition range
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.840]   did just the opposite.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.660]   It actually enhanced my focus and my cognition,
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.920]   my overall levels of physical energy,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.080]   which is great because it allows you to do
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.880]   all the other things that we're required to do
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.720]   throughout the day.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.440]   And by the way, it'll also allow you
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.600]   to get more of that zone two cardio.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.460]   So if you want more details on the three by five protocol,
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.800]   again, that's timestamped in the relevant episode
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.920]   on strength and hypertrophy
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.820]   that we did with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.420]   I'll also provide a link to that specific timestamp
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.640]   in the show note caption to this episode.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.360]   I do want to point out that
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.120]   you don't just jump right into heavy sets
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.260]   of three to five repetitions.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.120]   You need to warm up adequately.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.780]   For some people that warm up
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.400]   will be higher repetition sets.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.360]   So say 10 to 12 repetitions with just the empty bar
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.280]   or a lightweight and then adding a little bit of weight
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.200]   and doing eight repetitions and maybe six repetitions.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.000]   And then your work sets as they're called
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.840]   of three to five repetitions.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.120]   Or perhaps you're like me
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.600]   and you prefer to do low repetition warmups.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.440]   So this was also something that I discussed
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.180]   with Dr. Andy Galpin and that for me
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.880]   has made a tremendous positive impact
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.380]   on all my resistance training,
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.480]   regardless of whether or not it is low repetition
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.600]   or higher repetition.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.480]   And that's to do a brief warmup set
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.040]   that is somewhere in the range of six to eight repetitions.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.560]   Very light, just to get familiar with the movement.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.320]   Then to do a second warmup set
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.640]   that includes some load on the bar
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.480]   or the free weight or the machine.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   And then a second warmup set.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.440]   Again, this could be free weights or machines
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.420]   that incorporates a bit more load
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.800]   but still keeps the repetitions low.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.360]   So in the four to six repetition range.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   And then maybe,
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.400]   especially if it's at the beginning of the workout
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.600]   and my core body temperature isn't elevated yet,
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.220]   I'll do a third warmup.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.760]   But that third warmup,
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.360]   which of course is going to be
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.720]   progressively a little bit heavier
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.280]   than the first or second warmup,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.720]   is still going to fall within the low repetition range.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.040]   So just two to four repetitions.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.560]   For me, including a few more warmup sets
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.920]   with progressively heavier weight on each warmup,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.940]   but still keeping the total repetition count low,
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.540]   so somewhere in the range of two to six repetitions,
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.300]   has been very beneficial for improving my work output
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.240]   during the so-called work sets,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.720]   regardless of whether or not I'm training
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.360]   in the three to five repetition range
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.660]   or whether or not I'm training
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.220]   in the six to 15 repetition range.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.200]   I know for some people, this might be kind of surprising.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.120]   How is it that my work sets are actually higher repetition
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.500]   than my warmup sets?
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.420]   Or put differently,
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.440]   how and why is it that my warmup sets
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.240]   are lower repetition than my work sets?
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.920]   And that's because I fall into this category of people
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.500]   that tends to fatigue pretty quickly
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.360]   when doing resistance training.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.700]   So for me, keeping the repetition count
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.360]   on any individual warmup set pretty low
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.160]   has allowed me to really improve my strength output
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.860]   and really improve my strength and hypertrophy training
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.880]   when I shift to the so-called work sets.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.920]   So I already listed off
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.800]   a number of important documented benefits
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.000]   and benefits that I've certainly experienced
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.260]   by incorporating low repetition, pure strength work
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.920]   into my yearly training cycle
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.880]   for periods of eight to 12 weeks.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.360]   In addition to that, during my conversation
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.000]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, he said something very important
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.020]   for everyone to hear and understand.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.700]   He said, when you look at the data on aging and performance,
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.980]   in particular, muscular performance,
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.180]   you see some very interesting patterns within the data.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.700]   He said, for instance, that for every year after age 40,
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.300]   there's a 1% drop in muscle size
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.320]   that can be offset by resistance training,
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.660]   but that if you don't do resistance training,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.220]   that you won't offset.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.260]   And during that series, we also talked
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.200]   about the minimum requirement for six
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.660]   and probably more like 10 working sets per muscle group
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.660]   per week in order to at least maintain muscle size,
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.620]   not just age 40 and beyond, but even at younger ages.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.380]   Okay, so that's muscle size, 1% decrease per year
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.800]   unless you do the right thing.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.480]   And the right thing is get six to 10 working sets per week
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.220]   in order to offset that decrease.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.480]   And if you train properly for hypertrophy,
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.100]   yes, you can still increase muscle size past age 40.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.400]   In addition, he said that there is a 3% to 5% reduction
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   per year for every year past age 40 in strength and power.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.920]   Now, that's a very important metric
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.540]   because what it's telling us is that the drop-off
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.240]   in strength and power is significantly greater
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.440]   per each year after age 40
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.320]   than is the decrease in muscle size,
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.220]   telling us that we have to do something
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.720]   to offset that decrease in strength and power.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.220]   In addition, he mentioned that for every year past age 40,
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.220]   there is an 8 to 10% decrease in speed and in explosiveness.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:08.460]   And so if one is interested in maintaining speed
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.380]   of muscular movement and explosiveness of muscular movement,
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.060]   something that's perhaps important to a number of you,
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.820]   one also has to incorporate training specifically geared
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.620]   toward maintaining or improving speed and explosiveness.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.060]   Now, I, like many people,
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.100]   I'm not so interested in speed and explosiveness.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.700]   I know they have their utility,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.480]   but I am interested in maintaining muscle size
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.660]   over the course of my life,
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.580]   perhaps even adding some muscle to particular muscle groups.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.540]   I'm also very interested in at least maintaining
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.540]   and ideally even gaining some strength
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.420]   in certain muscle groups throughout my entire lifespan.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.500]   And that's not just for performance reasons.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.460]   That's also because we know that maintaining
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.780]   or improving strength of our muscles is very important
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.580]   across the entire lifespan.
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.780]   But especially in the years spanning from 40 until death,
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.140]   which I think for most people fall somewhere between 50,
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.880]   60, 70, or ideally out into the 80s, 90s, or 100s, right?
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.420]   That's what we're all seeking is to die later
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.060]   in better health.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.620]   And in order to do that,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.740]   we have to dedicate some very specific training protocols
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.820]   in order to maintain or build strength.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.180]   So to summarize, in addition to all the positive reasons
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.500]   to do dedicated strength training that I mentioned before,
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.260]   it's highly recommended that you do
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.820]   some dedicated strength training for the purposes
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.100]   of offsetting the age-related decline in strength
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.020]   that occurs, again, three to 5% per year past age 40,
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.260]   which is a pretty significant decline.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.260]   But the good news is if you do the three to five protocol
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.020]   for say 12 weeks per year,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.200]   and then you continue to resistance train
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.380]   using other repetition ranges geared towards hypertrophy
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.020]   and strength, or perhaps even muscular endurance,
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.100]   the good news is you'll maintain your strength
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.900]   and perhaps even build your strength,
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.640]   offsetting that natural decrease that would otherwise occur.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.020]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.060]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.540]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.900]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.780]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.480]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.700]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.300]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.380]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.360]   once or usually twice a day
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.260]   is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.960]   that I need for gut health.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.060]   Our gut is very important.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.620]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.360]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.760]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.420]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.260]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.100]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.660]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.580]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.460]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.020]   nutritional needs are met.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.900]   And it tastes great.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.360]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.740]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.720]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.040]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.620]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.020]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.700]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.100]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.100]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.460]   The next tool I'm about to describe
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.460]   relates to your cardiovascular training.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.140]   And it's a tool that can greatly improve
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.880]   your cardiovascular fitness
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.660]   with a limited amount of time commitment.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.220]   But that is not to say it is easy.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.380]   What I'm referring to is the so-called sugarcane.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.820]   If you listen to the series with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.620]   you may recall our discussion about the sugarcane,
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.820]   which is so named after our friend
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.220]   and expert trainer, Kenny Kane.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.940]   And it is a very efficient yet somewhat brutal way
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.540]   to increase your cardiovascular output.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.840]   So the sugarcane is the type of protocol
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.700]   that you would incorporate once in the period of a week,
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.900]   but certainly not every week.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.200]   It's the kind of thing that you might throw in
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.420]   once every two weeks or once every four weeks
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.380]   as a replacement
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.300]   for your other high-intensity interval training.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.640]   The sugarcane involves selecting some form of exercise
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.920]   that you can do at high intensity safely.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.020]   That, of course, will differ between individuals.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.180]   For some of you, it will be a stationary bike.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.580]   For others of you, it will be a road bike.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.060]   For others of you, it will be running.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.240]   And for others of you, it will be rowing.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.800]   The exact form of exercise is not important.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.280]   What is important is that you can generate
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.420]   a lot of intensity.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.880]   So you're going to be doing some sprint-like work,
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.660]   although not all-out sprints, except on the final round.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.020]   I'll explain where all this is going in a moment.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.820]   But again, you need to select a movement
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.280]   that you can do without injuring yourself
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.820]   while still performing a movement at high intensity.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.460]   So for me, that would be running.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.380]   For you, it might be something else.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.280]   The sugarcane is pretty straightforward in structure.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.980]   It involves three rounds after a brief warmup, of course.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.820]   So you're going to do three to five minutes of jogging
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.320]   or jumping jacks or skipping rope,
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.480]   something to get your core body temperature up
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.300]   so that you're prepared to do the high-intensity work.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.580]   And then there are only three rounds of high-intensity work,
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.080]   and they go as the following.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.020]   In round one, you're going to take two minutes,
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.140]   so you'll need to set a timer for two minutes,
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.500]   and you're going to go the maximum distance that you can
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.900]   in that two minutes.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.540]   So run the maximum distance that you can for two minutes,
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   or cycle the maximum distance that you can for two minutes,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.300]   or verse a climber the maximum distance
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.120]   that you can for two minutes.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.460]   Whatever you select, you're going to do that
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.740]   as far and as fast as you can
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.280]   for the duration of two minutes.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.660]   So depending on the movement
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.420]   and depending on your level of fitness,
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.660]   that distance might be 400 meters,
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.860]   600 meters, 800 meters, et cetera.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.400]   Whatever distance you travel in that two minutes,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.540]   you are going to mark that distance down in your mind
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.620]   or in your phone or on a piece of paper.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.460]   And then you're going to rest two minutes.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.000]   So two minutes of work, then rest two minutes.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.340]   Then in round two, you're going to go the same distance
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.900]   that you did in round one,
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.280]   and you're going to take as much time as you need
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.760]   to do that distance as fast as you can.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.400]   So if you went 600 meters in two minutes for round one,
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.160]   in round two, you're going to go 600 meters,
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.960]   and it's going to take you however long it takes you.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.480]   Chances are, if you really did the best you could
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.060]   in round one, you were at maximum output
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.280]   for the first two minutes,
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.600]   that in round two, it's going to take you longer
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.300]   than two minutes to travel that equivalent distance.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.060]   However, there is the possibility
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.640]   that it will take you less time.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.280]   But for most people, it's going to take you more time.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.680]   So staying with this example of 600 meters
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.240]   in two minutes on round one,
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.000]   in round two, you're going to go 600 meters,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.900]   let's say it takes you two minutes and 30 seconds.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:46.040]   You then are going to mark down how long round two took you.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.520]   So in this case, the example is two minutes and 30 seconds.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.120]   Then you're going to rest another two minutes.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.320]   And then in round three, you're going to go all out,
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.920]   again, as fast and as safely as you can
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.160]   for the same duration that you did in round two.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.080]   And your goal is to go at least as far
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.480]   as you went in round one.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.340]   And if there's still time left,
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.400]   you're going to continue to go all out,
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.720]   again, as fast as you safely can,
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.760]   until the entire duration is completed.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.580]   So it's really just three rounds with two rest periods
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.840]   in between round one and round three.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.800]   And then I highly recommend that after round three,
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.880]   that you do some sort of dedicated cool down.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.740]   So instead of just flopping onto the bench
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.180]   or the floor or the lawn,
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.320]   that you walk around slowly until you recover your breathing.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.260]   The reason I like the sugarcane as a tool
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.020]   that one implements once every, say, two to four weeks
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.320]   as a replacement for one's typical
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.680]   high-intensity interval training is several-fold.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.920]   First of all, if you provide the right intensity
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.600]   in round one and round two and round three,
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.060]   it is sure to elevate your heart rate substantially.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.660]   And in doing so, improve your VO2 max,
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.220]   which is correlated with all sorts of important metrics
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.160]   related to healthspan, performance, and lifespan.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.760]   Second of all, it gamifies things a little bit.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.640]   It pits you against yourself
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.720]   in the sense that if you go out at maximum speed,
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.200]   again, performing a movement that you can safely perform
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.720]   at maximum speed in round one,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.720]   well, then you have something to compete against
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.880]   in round two and round three.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.520]   And that makes the high-intensity interval training,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.160]   first of all, very intense,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.520]   but also it makes it kind of fun
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.040]   in a way that lets you forget
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.200]   just how painful the whole thing is.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.400]   The next tool to improve your fitness
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.880]   is called exercise snacks.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.640]   And as the name suggests, this is a fun one.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.740]   And was suggested by Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.400]   as a way to either enhance or maintain your fitness
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.880]   depending on how your core
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.360]   or foundational fitness program is going.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.180]   So when I say core, I don't mean your abs.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.680]   I mean whether or not you're getting your regular cardio
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.560]   and your regular resistance training.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   If you were to add one or several
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.720]   of these exercise snacks per week,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.160]   it can further improve things like VO2 max,
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.800]   muscular endurance, et cetera.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.680]   I'll talk about the specific snacks
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.880]   that you will be doing in a moment.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.480]   However, as Dr. Andy Galpin also pointed out,
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.580]   there are times in which we happen to not be following
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.320]   our foundational fitness program,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.440]   either because work demands or family demands
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.880]   or we're traveling.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.800]   We're simply not keeping up with our basic routine.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.880]   And under those conditions,
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.900]   exercise snacks are a terrific way to maintain the fitness
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.000]   that you've already built and developed.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.920]   And you don't lose any ground in a week say
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.880]   where you get particularly busy.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.200]   Now, exercise snacks can take on a variety of different forms
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.760]   but for sake of simplicity and clarity,
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.560]   today we're going to divide them into two major categories.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.880]   The first category are exercise snacks
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.320]   that are going to improve
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.000]   or maintain your cardiovascular fitness.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.680]   So your ability to run or cycle or row,
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.480]   some distance say 12 minutes or longer.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.040]   But keep in mind these exercise snacks are very, very brief.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.300]   They don't require that you do them
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.920]   for 12 minutes or longer.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.040]   What they're going to do is either maintain or enhance
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.360]   the type of endurance that allows you to continue
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.560]   in an activity for 12 minutes or longer.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.700]   The second category of exercise snack
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.800]   relates to muscular endurance.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.840]   Muscular endurance is a very important aspect of fitness.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.580]   And even though some people are already training
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.920]   for muscular endurance,
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.280]   it's something that most people
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.640]   are not doing enough training for.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.880]   Muscular endurance is your ability say
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.800]   to maintain a wall set or to maintain a plank
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.720]   or to do the maximum number of pushups
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.520]   that you can do in one session,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.760]   the sort of drop to the floor and give me as many pushups
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.160]   as you possibly can type of thing
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.580]   or as many sit ups as you can type of thing.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.800]   Muscular endurance translates
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   to a number of other aspects of fitness.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.140]   And it's something that we should all be working on.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.520]   And again, many people just don't make space for it
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.040]   in their regular routine.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.000]   So now we have these two categories of exercise snacks,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.120]   one geared toward enhancing or maintaining
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.040]   your cardiovascular fitness
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.020]   as it translates to longer duration endurance activity.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.240]   So 12 minutes or longer.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.180]   And then the other category is purely muscular endurance,
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.160]   which is essentially some bout of exercise
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.540]   that's going to be fairly brief,
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.080]   anywhere from a minute to two minutes,
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.660]   but certainly less than 12 minutes.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.440]   Okay, so let me give you an example of an exercise snack
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.200]   for enhancing your long duration endurance,
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.120]   12 minutes or longer.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.560]   And this is the sort of thing
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.000]   that if you are going to incorporate into your routine,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.800]   and I highly recommend that you do,
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.440]   can essentially be done any time with no warmup.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.960]   A good example of an exercise snack of this type
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.980]   would be to suddenly stand up from your desk
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.200]   and to do a hundred jumping jacks.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.080]   Now, depending on how fit you are
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.600]   and how fast you do those jumping jacks
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.640]   and how wide and tall you do those jumping jacks,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.300]   meaning, are you doing these kind of little things
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.960]   where your hands don't actually meet
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.820]   and your hand like parting your legs just a little bit,
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.240]   or are you doing full jumping jacks
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.520]   where you're really jumping and setting your feet out
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.640]   as wide as you comfortably and safely can,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.960]   and then bring your hands together.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.700]   It could take you anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.960]   Okay, so in the case of jumping jacks,
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.000]   you may end up doing this for 90 seconds,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.840]   but the point is to simply do a hundred jumping jacks,
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.360]   or if that takes too long,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.660]   you can even do just 25 or 50 jumping jacks.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.840]   The point is that it's going to get you
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.440]   moving your muscles.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.600]   It's going to get your heart rate up.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.980]   Even if you're very, very fit,
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.300]   if you're doing these fast enough
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.200]   and you're doing them with proper form,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.140]   it's going to get your heart rate up and then you're done.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.540]   You can sit back down to your desk,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.000]   or you can continue to walk through the airport.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.960]   Yes, I've done these in the airport,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.080]   typically not while walking toward my gate, but at the gate,
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.640]   but occasionally I'm feeling lethargic
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.300]   or I haven't had the opportunity to train that day,
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.120]   and perhaps I won't get the opportunity to train,
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.120]   so I'll do something like a hundred jumping jacks
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.940]   while facing the window,
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.880]   so it feels a little less awkward
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.600]   facing people while you're doing them.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.280]   And of course, you don't have to do jumping jacks.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.080]   An equally effective type of exercise snack
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.720]   is to find a stairwell and to simply go up that stairwell
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.160]   as fast as you safely can for 20 to 30 seconds.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.420]   So perhaps just find the bottom of a stairwell
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.520]   and go up that stairwell as quickly as you can,
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.020]   and perhaps go down as quickly as you can,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.360]   and just keep doing that for about 20 to 40 seconds,
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.540]   and then you're essentially done.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.740]   You could also opt to pick some distance
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.640]   away from your car in the parking lot,
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.720]   assuming you're not carrying any heavy bags or anything,
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.520]   and simply run to your car.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.000]   So 20 to 30 seconds of not necessarily all out sprinting.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.120]   You don't want to injure yourself,
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.080]   because again, this is done without a warmup.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.120]   These exercise snacks are designed to be inserted
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.600]   into your day and into your week, essentially at random.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.200]   You could plan them if you want,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.600]   but anytime you feel inspired
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.080]   or perhaps anytime you're feeling
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.360]   like you don't want to do one,
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.000]   you could simply do one of these exercise snacks.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.040]   And of course, doing jumping jacks or running to your car
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.720]   or taking the stairs very quickly up and down
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.100]   or just up and then walking down, for instance,
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.920]   and doing a few jumping jacks, things of that sort,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.360]   of course, can take on a near infinite number
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.300]   of different variations.
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.360]   So if you don't like any of the variations
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.540]   that I just presented,
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.160]   you can easily come up with something else.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.640]   Again, the purpose of these exercise snacks
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.400]   is to get your heart rate up.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.320]   It's, of course, to do this while not getting injured,
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.440]   and it is entirely compatible
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.740]   with an existing exercise program.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.880]   It in no way is going to impede your performance
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.980]   in strength or hypertrophy or other forms
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.640]   of long-form endurance or high-intensity interval training.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.080]   Quite to the contrary.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.780]   Everything we know about these exercise snacks
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.720]   is that they enhance various aspects of your physiology
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.600]   in ways that promote both recovery and performance
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   in your other types of exercise
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.420]   and your other types of athletic endeavors.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.580]   So no reason to think that they are going to be problematic
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.800]   for your training, but of course, don't trip, don't fall,
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.340]   don't undertake a movement
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.680]   that puts you into a range of motion
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.280]   that has you hurting your back or your knee
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.880]   or any other part of your body.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.920]   Start off slowly and find something
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.800]   that really works for you.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.240]   So these are very easy.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.580]   They take very little time.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.220]   They're fun, to be honest.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.860]   And as was discussed in the conversation
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.500]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, they're also very effective.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.420]   The second category of exercise snack
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.200]   are the exercise snacks that enhance muscular endurance.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.480]   So muscular endurance is the type of endurance
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.120]   that allows you to maintain a fixed position
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.480]   for some period of time,
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.320]   usually somewhere between one and three minutes.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.040]   But these endurance bouts
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.720]   are never going to last 12 or more minutes
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.880]   unless you are exceptionally evolved
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.000]   in terms of your muscular endurance abilities.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.480]   What I'm talking about here are things like planks, wall sits,
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.560]   maximum number of pushups, things of that sort.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.160]   And this is an aspect of fitness
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.120]   that translates to other aspects of fitness
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.620]   in a very important way.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.640]   And again, this was covered
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.960]   in the exercise series with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.760]   I don't want to go into any of the details now
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.620]   because it was all covered there.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.360]   It's very easy to look up because it's timestamped.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   But just in brief, muscular endurance allows the buildup
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.760]   of more microvascular supply to muscles and connective tissue
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.420]   in a way that allows delivery and removal
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.200]   of more nutrients and waste products.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.420]   Now, I realize to the physios,
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.080]   things like nutrients and waste products
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.360]   is far too broad a category,
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.580]   but what we're talking about here
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.180]   is the ability to deliver more fuel and oxygen
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.480]   and to remove waste products of muscular effort
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.560]   or to be more specific, neuromuscular effort.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.400]   This is a great thing
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.000]   because it can help you enhance your strength training,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.440]   enhance your hypertrophy training,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.840]   enhance your long distance endurance
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.960]   and your middle distance
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.120]   and even your short distance endurance.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.160]   And these exercise snacks for building muscular endurance
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.240]   are exceedingly easy to do.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.120]   And you can even do them while talking on the phone,
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.760]   especially if you're using headphones
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.820]   or if you have your phone on speaker.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.680]   A good example of an exercise snack for muscular endurance
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.460]   would be a 30 to 60 second or perhaps longer wall sit.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.660]   So remember wall sits?
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.860]   Wall sits are, as the name suggests,
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.140]   where you put your feet out some distance from a wall,
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.320]   you squat down into a seated position,
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.220]   but there's no chair there
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.140]   and then you maintain that seated position
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:58.360]   and that is harder to do over time, okay?
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.740]   You could lean back against the wall a little bit harder
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.060]   if you wanted to gain some extra support and continue.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.960]   But the idea here is that you're going to go
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.660]   not necessarily to muscular failure,
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.420]   but to the point where you can't continue
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.440]   to sit in that wall sit position.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.220]   You could also simply do this as an air squat
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.500]   down to the bottom position where you're comfortable
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.660]   and then you don't want to rest down there,
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.140]   meaning you want to maintain some tension
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.640]   in your quadriceps and other muscles of your lower body
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.220]   so that you're actively trying to support yourself
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.700]   in the seated position, but without a seat below you.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.120]   That can be done, again,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.980]   while on a speakerphone conversation,
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.420]   that can be done at random throughout the day.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.220]   You can just decide, okay, I'm going to do a wall sit now
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.140]   and I'm going to time myself.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.240]   I'm going to see how long I can do this for.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.600]   Or you could decide to do a plank.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.140]   I've done this while on a phone call.
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.720]   Sorry if it was you that I was talking to,
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.340]   but I put the phone on speaker
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.100]   and just gotten into a plank position
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.500]   and then I'll just have the conversation
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.640]   in the plank position.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.180]   I don't fight to maintain that plank position
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.620]   past the point where I could continue
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.940]   to have a conversation.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.720]   So again, this is a type of exercise
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.660]   that one is trying to incorporate into their daily routine.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.780]   If you wanted to dedicate a specific amount of time
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.020]   just to doing these exercise snacks, you could,
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.600]   but it's far more reasonable to assume
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.020]   that people will incorporate these
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.380]   into their daily routine more regularly
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.020]   if you can incorporate it truly
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.820]   into the other aspects of your routine, like work.
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.820]   You do this while watching TV or listening to a podcast.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.980]   One form of muscular endurance exercise snack
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.820]   that's really terrific and is a bit of a challenge
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.700]   that's fun is to just simply see
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.700]   how many pushups you can do.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.060]   And we talked about proper pushup form
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.800]   during the episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.660]   but here what we're talking about
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.300]   is chest all the way to the ground.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.500]   So it touches the ground,
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.520]   then pushing up till your arms are completely straight.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.360]   That's one pushup.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.240]   And then continuing in piston-like fashion,
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.700]   meaning you're not pausing at the top
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.260]   and taking a bunch of breaths.
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.400]   You're not going to a plank position, in other words,
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.420]   but continuing to do as many pushups as you can
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.880]   to see whether or not you can enhance that number over time.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.340]   And in any case, just to simply get your body working
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.260]   to engage the muscles of your chest, your shoulders,
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.500]   your triceps, and your core, et cetera.
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.100]   And to do that every once in a while.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.580]   So instead of needing somebody to say drop and give me 20,
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.800]   just see whether or not some point,
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.120]   any point throughout the day,
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.280]   you can get into a pushup position,
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.620]   do your maximum number of pushups,
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.020]   and then just mentally note that number to yourself.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.880]   Again, these exercise snacks serve multiple roles.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.160]   They're designed to get you moving,
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.660]   to get your heart rate going,
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.080]   to maintain or enhance your fitness
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.260]   in other domains of fitness.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.740]   And this is very important
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.540]   to not take too much time out of your schedule.
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.500]   In fact, like zone two cardio, right?
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.800]   Being the type of movement
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.320]   that you're just going to do a lot throughout the week,
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.860]   carrying groceries, et cetera, as we discussed earlier,
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:38.180]   these exercise snacks are designed to be incorporated
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.580]   into your daily life.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.540]   And I must say that having started doing these
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.100]   after recording the series with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.020]   I've noticed two things.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.700]   First of all, including these exercise snacks
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.780]   at least once a week
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.000]   and more like three to five times a week for me.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.820]   So that's one exercise snack done
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.220]   three to five times per week
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:58.900]   has definitely correlated with improvements in my fitness
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.540]   in other domains of fitness, strength, hypertrophy,
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.020]   long distance endurance, et cetera.
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.540]   Now I've changed a number of other things as well
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.420]   as a consequence of that series with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:12.440]   So I can't say for sure that it's the exercise snacks per se
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.080]   that are causing all those positive shifts.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.760]   I have to imagine that it's not just the exercise snacks,
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.060]   but they've become an important part of my routine.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.540]   And that relates to the second point,
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.300]   which is that the exercise snacks are designed to be fun
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.420]   and easy.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.320]   And so I really enjoy doing them so much so
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.340]   that if I don't do one for a couple of days,
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.660]   I can start to crave them a little bit
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.660]   kind of like the other kind of snack.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.520]   The next category of tool to improve your fitness
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.740]   relates to breathing or respiration.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.660]   Now breathing and respiration is an enormous topic
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:41.520]   in and of itself.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.780]   In fact, I did an entire episode
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.100]   on breathing and respiration.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.020]   And this is a topic that my laboratory works on extensively
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.300]   as it relates to anxiety control
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.380]   and some other aspects of mental health,
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:54.540]   as well as to physical performance.
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.440]   For today's discussion,
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.780]   I want to just review a few tools that one can incorporate
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.860]   both into workouts and around workouts
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.220]   that can greatly enhance fitness and recovery.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.640]   The first one is the type of respiration tool
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.860]   that you use between sets of exercise.
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.800]   And again, here, we're talking about resistance training,
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.520]   but we could just as easily be talking about
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.860]   rest between rounds of say high intensity interval training.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:22.700]   So for instance, between bouts of sprinting on the track
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.920]   or the bike or the treadmill or the rower.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.160]   A great pattern of breathing to incorporate
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.100]   during rest between sets
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.780]   is something that I've talked about before
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.100]   in other contexts, which is the physiological side.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.420]   The physiological side is a deep inhale through the nose
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.500]   to maximally or near maximally inflate your lungs.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.300]   And then a second very brief inhale,
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.860]   and it's necessarily brief
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.940]   'cause your lungs are already pretty full,
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.460]   to maximally inflate your lungs
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.420]   and to make sure that any of the little sacs,
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.580]   the little avioli of your lungs that have collapsed
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.500]   during the exercise exertion will re-inflate.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.820]   And then a long exhale until lungs empty.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.460]   So I'll demonstrate it right now
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.660]   as I've done many times before,
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.660]   but if you haven't seen it or heard it before,
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.420]   it's two inhales followed by an extended exhale
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.580]   and it goes like this.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.740]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.980]   [exhales]
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:21.180]   You'll notice that the inhales were through the nose
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.980]   and the exhale was through the mouth.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.620]   That's the ideal way to do it for a number of reasons.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.020]   Check out the episode that I did on respiration physiology,
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:32.140]   AKA breathing, if you want more details on why that is.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.580]   But two inhales through the nose
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.660]   and a long extended exhale through the mouth,
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.180]   the so-called physiological side, not named by me,
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:42.060]   but rather named by physiologists in the 1930s,
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.680]   is as far as we know,
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.220]   the fastest way to shift your nervous system
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.660]   from so-called sympathetic drive
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.540]   to more parasympathetic drive,
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.140]   from a state of greater alertness
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.240]   to a state of greater calm.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.080]   Now, the reason to do this
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.100]   between sets of resistance training
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.140]   is that the more that you can shift yourself
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.360]   from sympathetic drive to parasympathetic drive,
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.040]   that is from alert to calm in between sets,
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.860]   the more energy and focus you can devote to exertion
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.460]   during your work sets.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.340]   And so one way to do this that's very convenient
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.700]   and very effective
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:17.500]   is to consider the last repetition of your set
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.400]   a physiological side, which is not to say, okay,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.240]   I want to be very clear,
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.380]   which is not to say that you should do
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.220]   the physiological side during your set.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.820]   In fact, I recommend you do not do that,
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.040]   but rather if you're doing six repetitions
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.780]   of a given exercise and you, let's say fail on the sixth
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.180]   or you do that sixth repetition
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.460]   and you're just close to failure,
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.300]   'cause again, your work set should be too failure
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.500]   or close to it most of the time, then set down the weight,
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.340]   and then you're going to do the next repetition
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.020]   as the physiological side,
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.780]   meaning you're not going to do the movement,
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.440]   you're going to think of doing a physiological side
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.220]   as the last repetition of every set,
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.100]   not during the last repetition
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.220]   of the resistance training movement, okay?
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.840]   So the physiological side is something you do
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.100]   at the beginning of the rest period,
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.500]   immediately following a set.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.680]   If you'd rather think about it that way,
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.220]   because it's more convenient than thinking about it
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:04.280]   as the last rep of a set, be my guest,
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.460]   whatever works for you.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.060]   But what you'll quickly find
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.660]   is that if you do a physiological side
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.900]   right after completing your last repetition,
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.300]   you'll calm down much more quickly,
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.260]   your heart rate will come down more quickly,
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.000]   and you'll recover more completely
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.860]   in whatever designated rest period you've allowed yourself,
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.160]   whether or not it's 30 seconds,
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.780]   which would be very short, frankly,
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:26.340]   or it's a five minute period of rest between sets.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.700]   If you do one, truly just one physiological side
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.780]   at the beginning of the rest period,
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.940]   you are going to effectively shift your nervous system
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.460]   in the direction you want it to go
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.900]   during those rest periods.
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.460]   And of course, if you're training hard during your work sets,
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.860]   you run zero risk whatsoever of feeling so calm
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:44.060]   that you don't feel motivated to do your next set.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.720]   I promise you that it will allow you to relax more
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.460]   at the beginning of the rest period
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.040]   than you ordinarily would, to shift into a state of rest.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.140]   There are differing opinions about whether or not
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.900]   you should walk around or stay still
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:56.780]   during your rest periods.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.540]   I like to walk around a bit and stay standing.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.300]   I'm not one of these people that kind of collapses
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.560]   into a C shape on the bench in between sets.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.840]   I like to stand up and breathe normally,
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.520]   walk around, drink a little water, et cetera.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.720]   In any case, doing a physiological side
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.700]   at the beginning of each rest interval
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.360]   between work sets of resistance training
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.260]   is a very effective way to enhance your focus
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.340]   and your output during your work sets.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.060]   Now, the last respiration tool to improve your fitness
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.100]   is again, a tool gleaned from the discussion
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.600]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, and that's to include
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   a three to five minute period
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.240]   at the end of every single workout.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.620]   So it doesn't matter if it's high intensity
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.740]   interval training, or it's resistance training,
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.100]   or it's a long run of some sort.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.700]   At the end of every workout to take three to five minutes,
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.180]   so you'll want to set a timer,
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.560]   and to do some form of parasympathetic
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.240]   that is calming, promoting breathing
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.520]   in order to shift your nervous system
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.520]   from a state of heightened alertness and output
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.920]   into a state of recovery.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.300]   Because as you all well know by now,
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.300]   you get fitter not during your workouts,
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.740]   but rather after your workouts, in between workouts.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.440]   So you stimulate the adaptation during a workout,
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.780]   but you get the adaptation,
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.580]   you get the actual improvement in between workouts.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.620]   And a common mistake that many people make,
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.260]   and I made this mistake for years,
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.900]   was to finish a great workout,
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.020]   and then you're texting on your phone,
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.860]   or you're talking on the phone,
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.760]   you're driving home, it's certainly not as intense
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.160]   as the workout that you just did.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.900]   Maybe you're even feeling really calm from a nice long jog,
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.940]   or you had a particularly good workout that day
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.500]   and you're feeling really happy,
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.120]   so you're enjoying the high, so to speak.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.340]   Well, when you do three to five minutes
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.180]   of what's often called downregulation breathing,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.500]   after a workout, it allows you to recover
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.800]   and to induce the adaptation that you've been after,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.020]   the one that you actually train for, much more quickly.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.860]   I can't tell you how many people I know
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.220]   who start to incorporate this into their workouts
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.340]   find that they recover far better from their workouts,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.620]   which might seem a little bit surprising.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.300]   Why would it be that just three to five minutes
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.500]   of some activity would enhance recovery
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.820]   to such a great degree?
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.160]   And that's because typically
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.480]   people don't bookend their workouts.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.660]   They finish their workouts,
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.460]   and of course they're not continuing to lift weights or run,
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.380]   but they move about their day and their life,
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.700]   even if it's preparing a meal,
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.540]   in a way that the level of stress,
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.260]   and therefore stress hormones,
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.260]   things like cortisol, adrenaline,
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.100]   things that, by the way,
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.340]   are excellent to elevate during a workout,
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.900]   things like inflammatory markers,
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.780]   which, by the way, are great to enhance during a workout.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.020]   That actually happens during a workout.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.260]   You have a massive increase in inflammatory markers,
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.860]   which might seem bad,
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.820]   but all of those things are enhancing
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.780]   the adaptation that you're seeking.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.520]   But as soon as those workouts end,
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.620]   you want to shift into recovery mode.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.200]   And this three to five minutes of down-regulation breathing
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.760]   is a terrific way to do that.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.500]   There are a couple of different patterns of breathing
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.020]   that will work best,
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.500]   but all of them emphasize exhales, okay?
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.360]   I want to repeat that.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.780]   All of them emphasize exhales.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.660]   So for instance,
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.980]   you could just choose slow, deliberate breathing.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.460]   How does that emphasize exhales?
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.900]   Well, ordinarily, when we breathe,
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.520]   we inhale actively and we exhale passively.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.100]   Whenever we deliberately breathe more slowly,
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.420]   we are actively exhaling, okay?
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.060]   So active exhales really promote the calming response
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.680]   in brain and body.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.740]   The other thing you could do,
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.600]   which many people are now doing,
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.520]   is to do a repeated round of physiological size.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.160]   So the double inhale through the nose,
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.580]   long exhale through the mouth,
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.420]   but repeated for, say, three minutes.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.720]   That's another version.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.060]   The other thing you could do
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:32.100]   is simply to notice your exhales
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.700]   and to emphasize your exhales,
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.300]   make them longer and more vigorous than your inhales.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.420]   Now, you don't want to turn this into a breath work session
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.640]   where you're doing pranayama or Kundalini breathing
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   or something of that sort.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.580]   The idea is to calm down.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.560]   So anytime you're extending your exhales,
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.820]   you're actively exhaling,
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.220]   you're trying to slow your breathing down overall,
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.180]   you're going to shift yourself in the right direction.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.380]   So rather than complicate this type of tool,
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.260]   the best thing you can do is just focus on those exhales,
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.860]   slow your breathing overall,
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.420]   use physiological size if you want,
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.560]   or simply sit in your vehicle,
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.700]   or if you have to, drive home
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.480]   while doing this extended exhale type of down regulation.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.900]   Ideally, you would take a couple of minutes
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.860]   and just shift your whole system by not driving,
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.580]   closing your eyes and just sitting in your car,
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.780]   stationary, of course,
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.300]   don't drive with your eyes closed
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.620]   or bike with your eyes closed.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:26.560]   Just simply calm down, extend your exhales
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.940]   and shift from the workout to the recovery mode,
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.460]   which is where the progress is going to arrive.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.580]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:36.280]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.660]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.140]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.680]   to help you better understand your body
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.580]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.900]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.220]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.460]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.020]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.060]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.940]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.100]   about hormones and so on,
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.100]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.400]   With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.180]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.080]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.060]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.260]   and behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.040]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.300]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.620]   Inside Tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.820]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.460]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.040]   and energy regulation.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.500]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.300]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.760]   The next tools to improve your fitness
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.300]   are psychological tools,
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.600]   and they're really geared toward enhancing your focus
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.020]   during your workout and separating
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.660]   or segmenting your workouts
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.660]   from the other parts of your day.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.980]   Now, of course, workouts are naturally segmented
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.300]   from the other parts of your day
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.560]   unless you're running around all day long
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.740]   or you're lifting weights or other heavy objects
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.000]   all day long.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.100]   But one of the more attractive tools
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.980]   that was presented during the series with Dr. Galpin
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.080]   that I adopted and found to be really effective
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.040]   is this concept of the line.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.180]   The line is this concept that you have a physical location,
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.220]   say at the entrance to a gym
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.180]   or at the start of your run or your bike,
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.540]   or maybe it's around the stationary exercise device
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.980]   that you use,
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.440]   for which once you cross that line,
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.800]   you are all about business, okay?
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.140]   You're not socializing, or at least not too much.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.140]   You don't want to be rude to people,
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.240]   but you're really focused on your workout.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.180]   So this is especially effective on days
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.820]   when you're a little bit distracted
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.460]   or you didn't sleep that well the night before,
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.020]   or maybe you got something going on in mind
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.620]   or you're in an argument
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.460]   or you're excited about something else.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.780]   But if you care about your fitness,
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.340]   which I hope everyone does,
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.020]   and your goal during any workout
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.780]   is to stimulate a particular type of physiological
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.320]   adaptation, strength, hypertrophy,
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.300]   long distance endurance, et cetera,
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.660]   and you also don't want to get injured
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.980]   so that you can continue to train for your entire life
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.820]   as regularly as possible,
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.160]   the concept of the line is fantastic.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.820]   Because what it does is it forces you
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.740]   to compartmentalize the portion of your life
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:13.140]   that comes before the workout and after the workout,
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.520]   and also to really enjoy your workouts.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.700]   This is something that's not often discussed,
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.780]   but nowadays with the advent of smartphones,
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.940]   there's a lot of infiltration of other types
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.240]   of communication and information
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.820]   while one is supposed to be exercising.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.940]   And so our life has become far less compartmentalized
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:33.300]   than it used to be before the advent of smartphones.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.640]   Now, of course, smartphones are wonderful.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.440]   They provide all sorts of wonderful tools and benefits.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.640]   And of course I use one.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.780]   And I'll talk about how to incorporate the smartphone
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.720]   in a very specific way to enhance your workouts
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.860]   in just a moment.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.980]   But the idea of a line is you pick a location,
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.360]   it can change each workout,
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.580]   but ideally it would be at the threshold
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.760]   of where the physical location to the workout begins.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.360]   And once you cross that line, you are all business.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.220]   You are taking care of business,
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.460]   which is not to say that you can't enjoy your workouts.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.800]   In fact, you absolutely should.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.220]   One of the best pieces of advice
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.600]   that I ever got about fitness was given to me
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.120]   when I was a teenager and I started lifting weights.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.060]   And the person who was teaching me how to do that said,
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.860]   one of the best things that you can do
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.980]   and you absolutely should do for your fitness now
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.320]   and forever is to learn to enjoy training hard.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.560]   And that really stuck with me.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   I really do enjoy training hard,
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.760]   but that was something that I learned how to do over time.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.660]   I took on the mentality that I'm here by choice.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.040]   I'm here for my own good and my own fitness.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.760]   It's to enhance my life.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.840]   So I'm going to enjoy training hard.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.480]   I'm going to enjoy training effectively.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.520]   And of course there are days when I train a little less hard
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.120]   where I back off quite a bit.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.160]   I even take rest periods of a week every once in a while,
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.800]   every say 12 to 16 weeks, I'll take a week off
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.120]   and just do some activities like hiking
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:48.960]   and things of that sort.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.860]   I talked to all about extended layoffs,
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.820]   meaning a layoff of more than two days
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.340]   during the episode that I did by myself,
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.900]   which is the optimal fitness protocols episode.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.640]   But in any case, learning to train hard
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.340]   and enjoy training hard and really making the workout
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.400]   something that is separate from the rest of your life
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.120]   is one of the most gratifying things that you can do
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.180]   to enhance your overall fitness.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.940]   Because it really teaches you how to designate your mind
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.440]   and your body toward this one specific set of goals
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.480]   while you are there and to really enjoy the process.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:22.080]   Because fitness can be a truly enjoyable process
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.440]   even when you were exerting yourself especially hard.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.120]   And for you masochists out there,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.400]   it can be especially because you're training hard
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.760]   that it feels so good.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.360]   In any event, the key is to set some sort of boundary
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.700]   and know that when you cross into that boundary,
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.540]   you're training.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.760]   And when you cross out of that boundary,
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.960]   you're done training.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.620]   Which also lends itself to more adequate recovery
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.120]   and the decompression type breathing exercises
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.820]   that we talked about before.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.320]   I'm not going to tell you whether or not you need to do
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.460]   the down regulation breathing at the end of your workout
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.800]   within the line or after you cross the line,
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.640]   that's up to you.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.520]   I don't think one needs to get that specific.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.640]   Now, another tool that's wonderfully effective,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.720]   not just for your workouts, but for all areas of your life
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.600]   is if you are going to bring a smartphone to your workouts
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.280]   to set some boundaries around what you're going to listen to
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.040]   and do with that smartphone during your workouts.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.280]   I see people texting.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.540]   I see people doing selfies.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.720]   I see people having phone calls.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.500]   I see people, I presume, listening to music or podcasts.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.800]   Look, I am not the smartphone police, nor are you.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.400]   And everyone has a right to use their smartphone
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.560]   in the way that they choose is best for them
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.900]   in order to distract themselves or focus themselves
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.260]   or enrich their life.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.820]   Look, it's a free world, of course,
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.100]   more for some than for others,
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.580]   but you can do what you want with your smartphone.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.040]   However, if your goal is to improve your fitness,
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.660]   one of the more powerful things you can do
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.440]   with your smartphone is to decide before you cross the line
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.460]   into your workout what you're going to listen to
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.000]   or do with that phone or not.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.360]   So for me, I like to designate a playlist of music
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.120]   for that particular workout.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.600]   And then I just stick to that playlist.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.860]   I might repeat songs that I like a lot,
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.040]   or someone talks to me while the music's playing,
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.440]   I might go back and restart a song if they distracted me,
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.400]   that sort of thing, although I do my best
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.400]   to not get into too much social chitchat during workouts,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.160]   but I'm friendly and it's nice
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.020]   when people come over and say hello.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.260]   I sometimes work out with other people,
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.640]   in which case I don't use headphones,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.120]   I don't use a smartphone.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.320]   But setting a playlist or two,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.720]   designating a podcast or two,
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.760]   designating an audio book or two,
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.680]   whatever it is that you're going to listen to
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.340]   to really decide what that's going to be
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:31.000]   before you do your workout.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.880]   The reason I say this is that I observe a lot of people,
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.620]   and frankly, I've observed myself under conditions
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.740]   where I'm suddenly in a text communication,
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:44.480]   or I'm bouncing between albums or between podcasts
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.640]   or between whatever it is on the phone
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.900]   to the point where rest intervals
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.380]   aren't being controlled well,
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.820]   to the point where focus during sets
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.800]   becomes harder to achieve at the beginning of a set,
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.920]   because in between sets,
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.440]   I was focused on a conversation, not on training.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.380]   I'm a big believer in making your exercise fun,
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.720]   making it accessible,
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:04.480]   meaning not so expensive or geographically difficult
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.360]   to achieve that you don't do it,
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.880]   or that it starts to interfere with other areas of life.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.720]   This is really important.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.200]   You want fitness to be blended with the rest of your life,
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.840]   but you don't want it so blended with the rest of your life
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.800]   that the rest of your life starts to impede your efforts.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.360]   Or, and this happens quite often for a lot of people,
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.060]   that workouts start to take an hour and a half,
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.200]   two hours when they could easily be completed
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.740]   in 45 minutes to an hour
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.440]   if you were just more efficient with your time.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.200]   And of course, you don't need me to tell you this,
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.280]   but smartphones can be one of the major bleeds
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.100]   on our focus and efficiency.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.960]   In fact, it can cause you to hemorrhage focus and efficiency.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.420]   So what I'm suggesting here
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.040]   is not throwing away your smartphone,
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.200]   although some people do benefit
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.820]   from just leaving it in the car
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.600]   or at home when they're training,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.720]   but rather to designate podcasts, books, music playlists
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.600]   for that particular workout,
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.360]   and to just stick to those for the duration of your workout.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.280]   And once you cross into the line,
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.560]   that's what you're listening to and only that or nothing.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.760]   And of course, once you cross back over the line
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760]   as you finish your workout,
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.860]   you can decide to continue to listen to the podcast
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.100]   or continue to listen to the audio book or to the music.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:09.940]   That's up to you.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.800]   Although I highly recommend that you do incorporate
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.800]   that down regulation period of three to five minutes minimum.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.760]   The last category of tools to improve your fitness
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.000]   come from the discussions about nutrition
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.040]   and supplementation and recovery
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.360]   in the series with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.920]   Now the list of tools I'm about to describe
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.240]   is not exhaustive,
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.800]   meaning it doesn't even begin to come close
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.380]   to the total number of tools that one could glean
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.520]   from the discussion about nutrition and supplementation
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.640]   that I had with Dr. Andy Galpin on this podcast.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.800]   But they are the major ones
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.480]   that are definitely worth knowing.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.280]   And those include supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.400]   Now, omega-3 fatty acids are found, of course, in foods,
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.560]   things like fatty fish and krill of all things,
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.380]   certain forms of algae, et cetera.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.560]   But most people do not get enough
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.720]   of so-called EPA form of omega-3s.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.360]   And for that reason, I and many other people
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.000]   choose to supplement with a minimum of one gram per day,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.520]   and in some cases as high as two grams per day,
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.100]   of omega-3s in supplement form.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.440]   So typically one would get to one to two grams of EPA
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.660]   by supplementing their nutrition, their diet that is,
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.860]   with fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.320]   There are many different sources of these.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.640]   That was discussed in an episode
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.040]   that I did with Dr. Rana Patrick.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.700]   I find that it's most cost efficient
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.560]   to get that one to two grams of EPAs from liquid fish oil.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.320]   Despite what you might see on the internet,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.200]   I don't have any relationship whatsoever
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.520]   to a liquid fish oil company.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.000]   You just want to make sure that you go
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.340]   with a reputable brand.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.960]   I like the ones that are flavored with lemon
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.840]   so that it offsets the taste of fish oil.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.960]   And I'll take a tablespoon or two of that per day.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.080]   And if I'm traveling, and even if I'm not,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   I will often use fish oil capsules.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.440]   And there are a variety of different sources
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.400]   of those as well.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.520]   Getting sufficient amounts of omega-3
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.760]   has been shown to be important for mood, okay?
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.320]   So as a way to offset depression,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.780]   but also for enhancing overall mood.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.400]   That probably relates to the omega-3's effect
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.640]   on neurotransmission, not just for neuromodulators
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.180]   like serotonin and dopamine, but for all neurotransmission.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.520]   And neurotransmission, of course,
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.880]   is essential for neuromuscular performance.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.020]   And the omega-3s have been implicated
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.640]   in reducing the inflammation response,
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.580]   cardiovascular health, et cetera.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.980]   I realize that there is some debate about omega-3s,
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.280]   but when I look at the bulk of literature
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.680]   about the omega-3s, it's very clear to me
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.840]   that getting one to two grams of EPA form
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.520]   of omega-3 per day is the right thing for me to do.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.360]   And many others find that as well.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.960]   The second tool to enhance your fitness
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.420]   under this category of nutrition and supplementation
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.320]   is creatine.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.900]   Now, again, creatine is not just found in supplement form.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.540]   It's also found, of course, in foods,
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.880]   in particular, red meat.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.280]   However, the amount of red meat that one would have to eat
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.920]   in order to get the amount of creatine
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.280]   that one would start to see
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.140]   a real performance-enhancing effect is just far too high.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:00.140]   You'd be ingesting far too much of other things in red meat
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.580]   that you wouldn't want that much of.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.920]   And for that reason, I and many other people
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.020]   will take creatine daily.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.700]   We now know there's no need to so-called load creatine
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.540]   in the old days, as it were.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.380]   So old days, by the way, meaning mid-90s and 2000s,
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.160]   we were all told that we had to load creatine.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.580]   We had to take high-dose creatine for four or five days,
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:20.860]   and then you could back off to a maintenance dose.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.820]   Now it's very clear you can just take a daily dose
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.580]   of creatine and that it really doesn't matter
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.080]   when you take that creatine.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.160]   You could take it post-workout, as many people do.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.200]   You could take it pre-workout.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.760]   It really doesn't seem to matter.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.160]   I happen to take it post-workout just as a matter of habit.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.340]   But again, you could take it any time of day.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.280]   Now, the point I want to make about creatine
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.300]   is one that's a bit different
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.660]   than the other discussions out there.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:43.360]   I have no issue with the majority of what's discussed
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.780]   about creatine out there.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.720]   For instance, that creatine monohydrate
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.800]   is the most effective form.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.440]   Unfortunately, creatine monohydrate
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.720]   is also the least expensive form of creatine
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.920]   that's sold out there.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.400]   I see no evidence whatsoever that the other forms
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.360]   of creatine are superior to creatine monohydrate.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.080]   But what you'll usually hear is that
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.360]   taking five grams of creatine monohydrate per day
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.280]   is ideal for everybody.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.400]   And that advice is simply not well-informed
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.920]   by the scientific literature.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.400]   If you are a larger person,
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.340]   so for instance, I weigh 100 kilograms,
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.560]   so that's about 220 pounds,
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.080]   well, it turns out if you look at the literature on creatine
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.600]   and athletic performance,
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.480]   and if you look at the literature on creatine
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.860]   and cognitive performance,
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.720]   because as some of you already know,
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.280]   creatine is a fuel or the phosphocreatine system
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.760]   is a fuel system for the brain as well.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.680]   And if you look at the studies on creatine,
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.240]   they almost always gauge the amount of creatine
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.800]   to give an individual based on their body weight.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.240]   So you don't have to get really specific about this,
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.960]   but if you weigh say 185 pounds to 250 pounds,
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.400]   you can get away with and probably should be
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.760]   taking 10 grams or so of creatine per day,
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.780]   which is what I do.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.000]   Whereas if you weigh less than that,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.920]   five grams or maybe even three grams is sufficient.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.680]   Now I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.740]   during that series.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.740]   And one of the things that I've started to do
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.280]   since the closure of that series
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.120]   is to take more creatine per day.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.340]   So now I'm taking 10, sometimes even as much as 15 grams
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.400]   per day of creatine.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.800]   Again, this is powdered creatine monohydrate.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.200]   My stomach tolerates it very well,
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.400]   but frankly, I don't tend to get stomach aches
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.240]   or gastric distress from pretty much anything,
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.120]   unless it's some form of food poisoning,
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:24.960]   which is exceedingly rare for me.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.760]   So some people out there find that creatine
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.960]   really disrupts their gut
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.120]   and they need to take it with food,
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.960]   or they really need to slowly increase
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.200]   the amount of creatine that they're taking each day.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.760]   I find that I can put 10, even 15 grams of creatine
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.240]   into a whey protein shake or into some water
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.240]   with a little bit of lemon juice
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.680]   just to make it taste a little less chalky,
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.080]   drink that and I don't have any gastric distress from that.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.800]   So you'll need to find what works for you.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.960]   But the point here is if you're going to take creatine,
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.320]   you don't just want to quote unquote take creatine,
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.460]   one scoop per day.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.600]   You really want to adjust the amount of creatine
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.240]   that you're ingesting according to your body weight.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.760]   And I would give you a very specific formula
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.720]   of X grams of creatine per kilogram or pound of body weight,
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.560]   but believe it or not, no such specific recommendation
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.120]   has ever been published in the scientific literature.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.200]   At least I couldn't find it in a whey
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.820]   that's consistent with all the other papers,
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.640]   meaning you see a lot of variation.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.160]   So what I'm talking about here
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.320]   is if you weigh 185 pounds or so,
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.880]   okay, plus or minus five pounds,
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.660]   out to about 250 pounds, 10 to 15 grams of creatine per day
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.740]   is probably more appropriate for you than is five grams,
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.680]   meaning it's going to be more effective
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.080]   for enhancing physical performance.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.800]   And perhaps, again, perhaps even cognitive performance
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.640]   as well.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.240]   And if you're somebody who weighs 180 pounds
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.040]   down to say 130 pounds,
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.260]   five grams of creatine per day is probably sufficient.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.200]   The point here is if you are taking creatine,
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.080]   again, not everyone has to take creatine.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.480]   There's no law that says that you have to take creatine.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.600]   Some people don't like it.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.200]   I know some people fear it's going to make their hair
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.020]   fall out.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.800]   We already talked about that in previous episodes
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.540]   and the lack of data to support that idea.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.560]   But I realize some people steer away from creatine
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.120]   for whatever reason.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.960]   But if you decide that taking creatine is right for you,
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.340]   adjust the total amount of creatine that you take
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.920]   according to your body weight.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.400]   The next supplementation-based tool
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.280]   for enhancing your fitness is rhodiola rosea.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.240]   Now, this very esoteric-sounding supplement
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.040]   is one that I learned about both from Dr. Lane Norton
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.680]   when he was a guest on this podcast, expert in nutrition,
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.600]   and frankly, training as it relates to resistance training,
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.120]   and from Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.580]   Rhodiola rosea is a supplement that's gaining
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.240]   increasing attention because it is what's called
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.920]   a cortisol modulator.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.760]   It does not necessarily suppress cortisol.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.780]   It does not increase cortisol.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:41.440]   It's a cortisol modulator.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.440]   And frankly, the mechanism by which rhodiola rosea
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.560]   modulates cortisol is still under investigation.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.640]   I hope to do an episode about it in the future,
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.520]   or at least make it part of an episode,
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.920]   because the hypothesized mechanism that's starting to emerge
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.960]   is really interesting as it relates to neurons in the brain
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.480]   that control the stress response and glands in the body,
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.680]   like the adrenals that control the stress response
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.340]   and that secrete cortisol.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.980]   Regardless, there's a growing body of research
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.400]   that has explored rhodiola rosea supplementation
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:16.280]   and one's subjective perception of fatigue or output
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.800]   during high-intensity training of various kinds,
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.920]   both resistance training,
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.120]   as well as running and endurance-type training.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.240]   So I started taking rhodiola rosea about six months ago
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.520]   in response to conversations that I had,
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.880]   again, with Dr. Lee Norton and with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.360]   And it's a supplement that I take
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.520]   before high-intensity workouts.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.240]   So I don't take it before a run,
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.840]   because frankly, my run's either very long and slow,
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.280]   or they're very brief,
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.680]   like a high-intensity interval training session.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.440]   And I find those to be pretty easy to recover from,
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.840]   even though they are very intense.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.880]   I might take a rhodiola rosea supplement
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.400]   before doing a 30-minute hill run that's very intense,
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.760]   but typically, I only take it about 10 to 15 minutes
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.800]   before any sort of
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.960]   high-intensity resistance training session,
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.700]   in particular, my leg day,
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:07.020]   which falls on day two of my exercise protocol,
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.000]   or the torso day or the small body parts day.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.240]   Again, here I'm referencing the way
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.040]   that I train across the week,
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.520]   and you can find that training protocol
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.560]   as a downloadable, completely zero-cost PDF if you like.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.200]   But I realize other people are using
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.760]   different body part splits and different combinations
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.640]   of resistance training and endurance training.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.120]   The reason I mentioned rhodiola rosea in this episode
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.480]   is that I realized that
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.520]   while some people might not yet be
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.240]   supplementing omega-3s,
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.340]   they might not be supplementing creatine,
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.800]   there are many of you who are already doing those things,
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.440]   and you're looking for additional tools to give you an edge.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.040]   So again, the rhodiola rosea
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.200]   would not fall into the category of foundational supplements.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.080]   Certainly get your nutrition right, get your sleep right,
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.000]   get your sunlight, all the basics first, please,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.200]   before even thinking about any supplements.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.300]   However, once you get into the category of supplements
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.120]   that can enhance fitness,
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.680]   rhodiola rosea does seem to have some good research
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.460]   to support it in the context of lots of different forms
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.180]   of high-intensity exercise.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.160]   Now, I can't tell you whether or not it's purely subjective
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.080]   or whether or not it's objective and subjective,
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.080]   but my experience has been that when I take rhodiola rosea,
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.400]   I definitely noticed that I can exert myself harder
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.600]   without feeling like I'm bringing myself to the brink
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.880]   of fatigue, either during the exertion or afterwards.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.280]   In other words, I feel like I can do more work
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.920]   without feeling so exhausted,
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.120]   and I feel as if I'm recovering
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.360]   from my workouts more quickly,
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.680]   in particular across the day after my workouts.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.620]   In fact, if I had to cite one specific subjective effect
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.600]   that I've experienced from taking rhodiola rosea
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.720]   before very high-intensity workouts
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.560]   is that prior to taking it,
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.960]   I would often find that three or four hours
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.060]   after the workout, having eaten a good meal,
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.180]   taking a shower, et cetera,
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:54.040]   and I was tired, I have a real dip in energy,
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.760]   but now I notice that I have a lot of energy
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.600]   throughout the day,
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.560]   even after these very high-intensity sessions
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.000]   in the early part of the day.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.260]   And frankly, I haven't changed anything else
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:04.440]   about my supplementation or my nutrition,
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.300]   at least nothing major.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.060]   So I personally am going to continue to take rhodiola rosea
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.560]   before these high-intensity workouts.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.100]   So for me, that's about two or three times per week.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.300]   However, if I forgot to take rhodiola rosea before a workout,
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.760]   I have no reason to think that that workout
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.160]   would go much worse.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.960]   This is a supplement that is designed
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.680]   to sort of give you an edge to be able to exert more focus
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.300]   and intensity during your workouts
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:29.660]   with less perceived exertion and to enhance your recovery.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.380]   The typical dosage of rhodiola rosea
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.960]   that you'll find in most supplements
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.480]   is 100 to 200 milligrams.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.060]   And of course, anytime you're going to take a new supplement,
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.480]   you would be wise to figure out the lowest effective dose
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.320]   from that supplement.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.260]   That's just logic, right?
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.120]   Why spend more money taking more of something
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.080]   that you don't need more of
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.500]   if you could get away with taking less of it,
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.960]   and it's just as effective, maybe even more effective.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.400]   So I typically will take 100 to 200 milligrams
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.180]   of rhodiola rosea about 10 to 20 minutes before a workout.
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.720]   However, I've taken as little as 100 milligrams
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.920]   on a consistent basis.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:04.300]   And frankly, I don't really experience much difference
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.720]   whether I take 100 milligrams
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.600]   or I take 200 milligrams before a workout.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.940]   So lately I've just defaulted to taking 100 milligrams
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.020]   of rhodiola rosea before any high-intensity workout.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.720]   Now, the final tool that I want to review
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.540]   for improving your fitness
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.920]   comes from the category of nutrition.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.440]   I've done lots of episodes
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.520]   about nutrition already on this podcast.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.360]   We've done episodes about intermittent fasting.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.780]   I did a long interview episode with Dr. Lane Norton,
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:32.660]   where we discussed all the ins and outs of nutrition
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:37.520]   as it relates to fat loss, muscle gain, fitness in general,
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.640]   lifestyle in general.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.960]   So check out that episode where you will learn
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.180]   his philosophy on nutrition,
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.300]   which frankly is the one that I largely subscribe to.
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.840]   It of course obeys the laws of thermodynamics,
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.980]   calories in, calories out, being fundamentally important,
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.760]   but also gets into all sorts of details
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.040]   about which sources of protein
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.640]   are most effective and bioavailable,
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.020]   how much protein you can incorporate into your muscles
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.260]   after training, et cetera.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.280]   All of that is included in that episode.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.400]   With that said, the series on exercise with Dr. Andy Galpin
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.040]   also included an episode on nutrition.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.880]   And while having the discussion for that episode
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.120]   and then listening to that episode again,
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.880]   I realized that while certainly I've gotten
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.080]   a number of things right about my nutrition
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.000]   across the years, there are a few areas
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.940]   where I could probably do better without much effort
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.440]   in ways that could really enhance my fitness.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.060]   And the thing that I'm referring to is that for me,
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.880]   my first meal of the day lands somewhere around 11 AM,
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:31.840]   maybe 12 noon.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.480]   Sometimes I'll eat an earlier breakfast,
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.120]   but most typically I hydrate and caffeinate
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.780]   and train in the morning and then I eat sometime
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.180]   around 11 or 12.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.720]   And then I eat my last meal of the day
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.860]   sometime around 8.30 or nine.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.760]   And as some of you already know,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.900]   I tend to organize my meals such that meals
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:51.440]   during the early part of the day tend to lean
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.480]   more toward protein and fibrous carbohydrates.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.880]   So things like meat and salad or chicken and salad,
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.480]   fish and salad, and maybe a little bit of starch.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.120]   And the meals that I eat later in the day
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.480]   tend to be more starch focused and more vegetable focused.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.520]   So things like pasta, rice, et cetera,
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.160]   later in the day because it helps me sleep.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.560]   And the architecture of all that
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.200]   is really about energy and focus.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.120]   I find I can focus a bit better
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.120]   and I have more energy throughout the day.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.800]   When I have my first meal at around 11 or 12
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.800]   and I keep the total amount of carbohydrates
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.800]   that I ingest during the day moderate,
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.880]   not low, but moderate.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.160]   Now there is an exception to that,
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.940]   which is if I do a high intensity resistance training
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.140]   session early in the morning,
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.000]   say train legs or train torso or even small body parts
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.380]   early in the morning,
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.540]   then I make sure to incorporate more starchy carbohydrates
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.820]   and some fruits, some simple sugars as well
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.260]   into the first meal of the day
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.040]   so that I can replenish the glycogen that I depleted
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.100]   during those high intensity resistance training sessions.
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.540]   However, after talking to Dr. Andy Galpin,
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:53.680]   I realized that I really shouldn't worry about
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.920]   or be afraid of eating something before training
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.880]   if I'm really hungry in the morning.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.420]   So what I'm referring to here
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:02.600]   are the times in which I wake up and I want to train,
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.560]   but I personally like to train fasted and caffeinated, okay?
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.500]   Yes, I do recommend that people delay their caffeine intake
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.840]   90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.680]   If and only if you have trouble with an afternoon crash,
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.240]   you know, real fatigue in the afternoon,
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.960]   then it makes sense to delay your caffeine
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.060]   90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.520]   However, the exception to that
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.420]   is that if I'm going to train early in the day,
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.540]   I do ingest water to hydrate as well as electrolytes
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.520]   and caffeine prior to training.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.440]   And sometimes that means I'm drinking caffeine
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.000]   within 30 minutes or 60 minutes of waking.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.440]   I've tried to be clear about this in previous episodes,
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.640]   but I think a number of people have come to think
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.120]   that I always delay my caffeine intake
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.760]   90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.960]   and that's simply not the case.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.520]   If I'm going to train, in particular,
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.780]   if I'm going to do high intensity resistance training
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:52.640]   or a long run, I will ingest caffeine
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.520]   sooner than 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.360]   And in addition to that,
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.160]   yes, I tend to eat my first meal around 11 a.m.,
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.400]   maybe 12 noon, but if I wake up and I'm very hungry,
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.920]   I will eat a small meal that includes
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.480]   typically some protein and some fat,
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.940]   so some Brazil nuts, maybe a couple of scoops of whey protein
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.600]   would be typical for me,
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.820]   or maybe even a little bit of oatmeal, some whey protein,
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:16.520]   not a lot of food in my gut,
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.560]   but after talking to Dr. Andy Galpin,
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.680]   what I learned was for some people training fast,
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:22.680]   it feels best.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.720]   I would consider myself one of those people.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.680]   You may be somebody in that category as well,
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.880]   or you might be somebody who really feels
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.160]   as if you run best, you resistance train best
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.200]   when you've eaten, say, 90 minutes
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.800]   or a couple hours before you do that.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.840]   There are basically no specific rules
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.240]   as it relates to whether or not you train fasted
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.560]   or train fed, except what you can handle
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.840]   in terms of gastric distress.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.400]   So you'll want to make food choices according to that
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.360]   and try and avoid, of course, gastric distress.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.480]   But basically the change that I've made
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.440]   is if I wake up and I'm hungry, I'll eat a small meal,
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.600]   or if I want to work out in the afternoon
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.080]   or I have to work out in the afternoon
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.880]   and I have lunch at, say, 12 or 1230 or 11 a.m.,
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.800]   and the only opportunity that I have to train
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.000]   is 1 p.m. or even 1230, I will go ahead and train.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.520]   And that's a new thing for me.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.540]   Typically, I try to keep my meals
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.900]   at least three to four hours prior to any training bout.
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.640]   And of course, if you're sleeping all night,
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.940]   you're not eating, and then if you wake up
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.000]   and you don't eat and you train in the morning,
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.560]   that's certainly longer than three or four hours
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.080]   unless you're sleeping very, very little, frankly.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.400]   So essentially what I'm saying is
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.080]   figure out what works best for you.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.240]   Do you prefer to train fasted or fed?
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.880]   For some of you, you might prefer fasted before cardio
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.920]   and fed before resistance training.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.200]   For some of you, it might be fasted is always best.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.920]   Again, I put myself in that category.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.700]   For some of you, it might be fed is always best.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.280]   Again, this is highly individual.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.640]   And that's another point that I'm trying to make here,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.000]   which is Dr. Gallopin really impressed upon me
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.240]   that there is no hard and fast rule about training fasted
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.180]   or fed.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:02.080]   And this is the second point that having some flexibility
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.540]   in whether or not you can train fasted or fed
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.040]   allows you to incorporate your fitness training sessions
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.320]   more readily into a shifting schedule.
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.240]   And that's a really overarching theme
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.720]   of everything we've been discussing today,
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.900]   which is, yes, it's wonderful and important
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.580]   to have a core fitness program,
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.560]   something that you're really striving to do
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.400]   each and every week.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.360]   And for me, that's three sessions of cardio,
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.040]   three resistance training sessions,
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.440]   and a day where I'm doing thermal stress training,
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.000]   which is just fancy language for deliberate cold
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.240]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   However, real life happens, travel, work, illness, family,
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.900]   all the sorts of things that can impinge
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.080]   on an exercise schedule and make it less likely
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.000]   that one would complete their workouts.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.760]   So today we've been discussing tools
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.920]   to improve your fitness, which are brief,
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:50.040]   easy to incorporate, scientifically supported,
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.440]   and that are shown to improve the various sorts
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.940]   of exercise adaptations and recovery
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.840]   that will allow you to get the most progress
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.760]   from your schedule.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.840]   So while the tools that we discussed today
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.680]   relate to breathing, they relate to nutrition,
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.920]   they relate to supplementation,
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.120]   they relate to specific set and rep patterns
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.320]   and cadences and rest periods, et cetera,
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.640]   all of those specific recommendations
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.840]   are within a larger container that I hope has become clear,
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.420]   which is the best tools to improve your fitness
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.760]   are the tools that, of course,
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.580]   are going to be effective in improving your cardiovascular
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.740]   and strength and hypertrophy training, et cetera,
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.680]   whatever it is that your goals are,
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.800]   but also tools that are going to make it easier
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.060]   and more likely that you are going to engage
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:34.620]   in your fitness program with enthusiasm,
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.640]   with effort, and with focus.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.880]   And as with any episode of this podcast,
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.400]   I covered a lot of information,
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.280]   and there are a lot of different tools
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.840]   that one could incorporate.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.440]   By no means do you need to incorporate them all,
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.640]   although if you choose to, that's wonderful.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.620]   Just even incorporating one or two of them,
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.480]   say, incorporating this notion of the line
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.980]   and the exercise snacks,
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:55.620]   or adjusting your level of flexibility
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:58.420]   as to whether or not you train fasted or fed and the line,
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:01.280]   or trying a 12-week cycle of purely training for strength
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.040]   when you do your resistance training.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.880]   But whether or not you pick one tool or all the tools
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.520]   or somewhere in between,
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.920]   the key thing is to actually implement them.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.280]   And I like to think that during today's discussion
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.820]   provided a number of tools, again, largely gleaned
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.920]   from the episode series with Dr. Andy Galpin's,
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.800]   and again, if you haven't seen that series,
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.720]   that's linked in the show note captions.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.340]   Those episodes are long, there are six of them,
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.820]   but they are a wealth of information
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:27.360]   of every aspect of fitness.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.320]   During today's episode,
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.620]   we're really just talking about the things that you can,
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.120]   and I do believe should,
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.860]   bring to your existing fitness program
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.960]   that can really make a positive difference
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.720]   without a lot of effort.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.480]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion,
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.880]   all about tools to improve your fitness.

[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.320]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.400]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.640]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.240]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is partnered
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.960]   with Momentous Supplements.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.540]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed

[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.040]   it is Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.720]   So that's Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.200]   And on all of those platforms,
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.020]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.640]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.860]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:51.000]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.240]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.600]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.760]   If you haven't already subscribed

[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.960]   and it includes podcast summaries and toolkits.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.720]   Toolkits are short PDFs that, for instance,
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.160]   describe a toolkit for sleep,
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.220]   a toolkit for learning and neuroplasticity,
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.520]   a toolkit for fitness, and on and on.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.140]   To sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter,

[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.060]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.820]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:37.400]   [upbeat music]
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.980]   (upbeat music)
