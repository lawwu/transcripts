[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.520]   - So we've been talking about anxiety and ADD
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.140]   in the last two episodes, episodes 281 and 282.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.040]   And Pastor John, you wanted to talk specifically
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.960]   about physical forces on our lives
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.360]   and how to use natural strategies to both cope and flourish
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.240]   within our personal limitations and challenges.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.920]   - Right, this is huge to me.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.520]   And I think I'm still learning about it.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.980]   It relates to ADD, it relates to anxiety and anxiety attacks
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.000]   panic attacks, to the issue of whether they're sin
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   or sickness or a mixture.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And it might be helpful to lay out just a little bit
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.560]   of what I've learned about making the physical remedies
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.980]   or strategies spiritual.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.920]   And that's the way I think about it is,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.840]   what makes the use of a physical strategy
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.960]   in coping or flourishing with ADD or anxiety attacks
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.920]   or any other problem for that matter,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.920]   what makes a Christian experience Christian or spiritual
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.580]   when they use the things that the world would use?
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.540]   And we all know that our spiritual condition
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.700]   is affected by physical aspects of life.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.380]   Our souls are woven together with our bodies
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.700]   and our environment in ways that are complex, inevitable.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.300]   God made us that way.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.780]   We are souls with bodies.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.840]   We always will be souls with bodies.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.940]   We're not platonic trying to slough off our body.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.060]   We are gonna be raised as bodies and souls in the last day.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.540]   And so this is huge.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.060]   We are physical, spiritual creatures.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060]   And we know that our spiritual responses in life
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.700]   are treating people with grace, for example,
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700]   is affected by sleep, food and nutrition,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.580]   drink, whether water for hydration or coffee or alcohol,
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.260]   all those affect us.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.940]   Exercise affects brain chemicals
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.380]   are brought about by heavy workout,
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.260]   weather conditions with high and low pressure.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.540]   When I was in Germany,
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.380]   everybody blamed certain traffic patterns on the food.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.700]   This was a weather condition of certain kinds of pressures
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.380]   that made everybody more irritable, they thought.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.660]   Inactivity, sitting around all day can make you listless
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.220]   and it has an effect on your mind.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.260]   A bracing walk on the beach
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.980]   or a peaceful chair by a sunset on a lake
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.740]   will have a different effect on your mood
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.980]   than if you're stuck in traffic all afternoon.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.440]   Smells of new moon grass and pine woods
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.500]   and ocean spray and cooking bacon.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.180]   I mean, you're talking about the things
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.900]   that just changed my whole outlook, right?
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.900]   On life hormone replacements for women, for example,
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.140]   in menopause, things like that,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.300]   iron supplements in your diet,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.060]   and then of course, antidepressants.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.020]   And so you see the whole range
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.140]   all the way from sleep to antidepressants.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.140]   We are people who are affected by the physical strategies
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.260]   and physical remedies that we embrace.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.100]   And so the question that we ask is one that Paul asks,
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.020]   I think in 1 Timothy 4, 4 and 5,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.420]   where he's referring to food and sex.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.460]   And he says, "Everything created by God is good.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.020]   "Nothing is to be rejected
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.600]   "if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.300]   "for it is made holy,"
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.500]   so now he's thinking sex and food,
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.900]   "it is made holy by the word of God and prayer."
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.140]   So embedded in those two verses is the question,
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.540]   how do you take a natural thing
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.460]   that the world enjoys as well as we do
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.900]   and turn it into something spiritual or holy?
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.500]   And here are my five steps for doing that, Tony.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.660]   This may be, this is my best shot
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.760]   at trying to help a person practically
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.680]   think about sleep or antidepressants
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.280]   or the whole range of everything else in between
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.020]   that affects our moods and our spiritual condition.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.060]   Number one, acknowledge this physical benefit
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.900]   that we are now getting,
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.260]   whether it's sleep or food or exercise or medication,
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260]   acknowledge that this physical benefit is a gift of God,
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.380]   not just nature.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.060]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.980]   Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4, 7.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.500]   Number two, admit you are dependent utterly on God,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.900]   totally on God,
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.560]   whether through a created help or supernatural,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.220]   this is gonna make a difference.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.060]   I mean, God can step in supernaturally
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.020]   and cause a difference,
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.420]   or he could use the natural means we're using.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.260]   John 15, five, "Without me, you can do nothing."
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.980]   And so we're utterly dependent on him.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.700]   Number three, pray for his intervention
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.980]   through this physical means,
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.340]   or if he pleases, supernatural.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.220]   Let all your requests be made known to God
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.300]   and the peace of God will keep your mind.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.240]   So pray. Number four,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.440]   trust him to fulfill the promise of his help.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.920]   This is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920]   I will help you, I'll strengthen you,
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.000]   I'll hold you up with my righteous right hand.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.440]   So trust me, trust me that this is gonna make a difference
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.360]   and I'll help you through this physical means.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.280]   And then finally, number five,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.960]   thank him for what he does.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.200]   Give thanks in all of those circumstances.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   So, conclusion, whether it's sleep or coffee
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.960]   or exercise or antidepressants,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.200]   this is how we take the gifts of God in the physical world
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.120]   and sanctify them for the sake of our souls.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.280]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.700]   And thanks for listening to this episode.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.000]   This episode follows two earlier ones on anxiety and ADD.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.080]   Those were episodes 281 and 282,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.600]   which can be found in the Ask Pastor John archive.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.840]   Well, imagine you meet a young man
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.320]   who is a brand new believer.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   He holds out to you his brand new Bible
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.320]   and he asks you where he should start reading
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.960]   this intimidatingly long and old book with no pictures.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.200]   Where do you encourage him to start reading?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   I'll ask Pastor John that very question on Monday.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.320]   Have a great weekend.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
