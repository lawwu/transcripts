[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   Pastor John, what hope would you offer to a listener right now who is a stressed wife
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.000]   or a stressed husband, who is disappointed in their spouse, they are frustrated with
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   their marriage, and they're now considering a divorce as a way of escape out of the frustrations?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.320]   Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is that more pain is experienced in marriage
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   and parenting than anywhere else in the world.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.920]   This is the cost of covenant making and covenant keeping love.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.600]   It cost Jesus his life to be in that kind of relationship.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.080]   So I'm not making light ever of the kind of pain that can be sustained in a parenting
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.320]   or a marriage relationship.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:10.200]   And the first thing I'd say is that the path to hope is not the path of divorce.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:21.600]   God can rescue sinners from the disaster of a divorce, but he warns, "Let us not sin that
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.040]   grace may abound."
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.080]   Planned sin is not accompanied by any promises of hope.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:39.120]   Jesus said, Mark 10, 9, "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.600]   And the deepest reason for that prohibition of breaking a marriage is that marriage was
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.800]   created by God from the beginning as a picture or an expression of the covenant-keeping love
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   of Christ and his church, Ephesians 5:22 following.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.240]   So my word of hope begins with a plea.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.600]   I've given it countless times to women and men.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.480]   Put divorce out of your mind as a remedy.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.000]   Don't consider it.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.560]   Say to yourself in the truth of Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit, this is not
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   an option.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.520]   I'm not going to pursue this.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.640]   It may be forced upon me, but I'm not going to pursue it.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.960]   Don't want it.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.640]   Pray and work in the other direction.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.320]   You might have sinned your way into this marriage.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.880]   Lots of people say, "Well, I just blew it at the front end.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   I made all kinds of stupid judgments about this man.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.360]   I wasn't acting in a mature, biblical way."
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.640]   And that's true.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.320]   You may have sinned your way into this relationship, but now that you're married, this man, this
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.840]   man is God's man for you.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   That is an amazing truth.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   He is God's choice for you.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.320]   Yes, he is, no matter how you may wish that you could do it all over again.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.640]   So I would say, look to Jesus as the one who satisfies in measure now and immeasurably
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.480]   later.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:33.360]   Believe that the path of lost dreams in this life is the path of greatest joy overall.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:44.440]   Know this, maximizing your earthly happiness is not the goal of life or marriage.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.560]   Maximizing your eternal happiness is, because God said, this is really crucial, I think,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:00.960]   for marriage, Romans 5, verse 3 following, "Rejoice in tribulation, because tribulation
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.680]   works patience, and patience works approvedness, and approvedness works hope, and this hope
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.000]   does not disappoint."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   In other words, marriage may disappoint with a thousand tribulations, but hope-filled obedience
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.400]   to God will never, never disappoint us.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.680]   God says so.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.320]   Hope does not disappoint.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.920]   But escaping tribulation, the tribulation that obedience calls for, escaping tribulation,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.200]   that is not hope-promised, hope-filled.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   It's not the path to greatest hope or greatest joy.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.040]   It is good and it is right to want things to change now.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.240]   Oh yes, we all do, don't we?
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.880]   We want things about our spouses and ourselves to change now.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I think that's why Peter wrote 1 Peter 3, 1-7 for wives in particular, because these
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.360]   words are meant to help a woman know how to think about changing her husband, in this
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.960]   case an unbelieving husband.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.520]   And she should pray earnestly for him and for the whole situation.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.760]   That's why those verses are there.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.160]   I would recommend that she pray over them long and hard, but don't stake your greatest
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.280]   happiness on his change.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.600]   If you do that, you'll probably become demanding and nagging and angry, all of which will be
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   self-defeating.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:43.840]   So, focus your main heart energies not on fixing his failures, but on deepening your
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.280]   own godly responses to those failures.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.000]   That's what God expects from you.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.920]   God does not hold you accountable for your husband's sins, but he does hold you accountable
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.240]   for the godliness of your responses to those sins.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.600]   There will be a thousand acts of grace that your husband will not reward or perhaps not
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.920]   even notice, and you will feel so alone in your sorrow.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.800]   But hold fast to this truth.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.320]   God sees in secret.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.880]   That's Matthew 6, 3 and 4.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.080]   God sees every tiny expression of your patience and mercy and respect.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.520]   He sees them all, and he writes them down.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.040]   Your quiet sorrows are never wasted.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.680]   You will be repaid at the last day, and perhaps, perhaps in this life, more than you could
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.840]   ever imagine.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   In the decades that have gone by, God might work a miracle in that man, and you might
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.280]   end in a way that you never dreamed.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.880]   Let me close with one illustration.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.840]   A woman came to me one Sunday, about 30 years into my ministry.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.000]   I remember it so clearly.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.240]   It was at our South Campus, and she reminded me that when she was about to leave her husband
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.280]   20 years ago, she came to me, and I pleaded with her, "Don't do it."
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.440]   And she gave me all the reasons why he was just totally unresponsive, unaffectionate,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.480]   traveled all the time, didn't pay any attention, didn't care for the kids, every reason that
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.720]   he was just not there.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.900]   And she told me now, at this point, 20 years after that, having stayed in the marriage,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:47.360]   she said, "He's building a room on our house for my mother to stay with us in her final
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:55.160]   years, which is the most wonderful, sacrificial act of love he could possibly have done for
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.280]   me."
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:03.540]   He had become a kind and thoughtful and very different man, and she just thanked me and
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.400]   said, "That's what I'd be missing today."
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.120]   That's a wonderful testimony to end on.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.560]   And it's worth mentioning another episode where Pastor John addresses divorce, which
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.880]   is episode number 165.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.040]   It's titled, "Is My Husband's Porn a Marriage Deal Breaker?"
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.560]   Also one of our most popular episodes on marriage is episode number 144 of this podcast.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.800]   It's titled, "What Advice Would You Give Newly Married John Piper?"
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.160]   These episodes can be found in the Ask Pastor John app for the iPhone and the Android.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.320]   Well, we are Christian hedonists.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.660]   We believe that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.520]   But do Christian hedonists confuse joy and faith?
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.200]   I'll ask Pastor John that very question tomorrow.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.700]   Thanks for listening.
