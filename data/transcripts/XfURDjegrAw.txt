[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.880]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.680]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.480]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.540]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.560]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.640]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.400]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.560]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.120]   Our first sponsor today is Theragun.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.800]   Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400]   that releases deep muscle tension.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.040]   I was first introduced to Theragun in 2017
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.160]   while on a laboratory expedition.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.800]   We were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000]   filming great white sharks for my laboratory studies
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720]   on fear using virtual reality.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.880]   We were working very hard around the clock,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.360]   and I and other people on the trip
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.900]   were picking up a lot of aches and pains
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.440]   and just kind of chronic soreness.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.680]   A couple of people had injuries that were flaring up
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.500]   because of all the hard work and lack of sleep.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.960]   Someone had a Theragun,
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.720]   and pretty soon it was getting passed around.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.740]   It became the most coveted device on board.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.800]   Everyone was using it to work
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.440]   on these different sites of soreness.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.960]   And I really fell in love with the thing,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.560]   so much so that when I got back,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.040]   I immediately purchased one,
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.720]   and I've used it almost daily ever since.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.240]   I use it on muscles that are sore.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.440]   I use it on areas that I'm really working on
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.120]   to release tension and improve tissue quality and so forth.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.180]   The great thing about Theragun is it's really quiet,
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.340]   so you can use it while you're in a conversation
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.600]   or while you're watching a movie,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.460]   and it doesn't disrupt those activities at all.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.400]   If you want to try Theragun,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.300]   you can try Theragun by going to theragun.com/huberman
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.720]   to get your Gen IV Theragun.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.440]   They start at $199,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.420]   but if you think about it,
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.400]   a massage, which is an hour long or 90 minutes long,
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.640]   is typically in that range of cost.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.440]   And this is something you can use every day
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.160]   whenever you want and even while enjoying other activities.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   So that's theragun.com/huberman.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400]   The second sponsor of today's podcast is Inside Tracker.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.920]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.760]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.360]   to help you better understand your body
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.100]   The great thing about Inside Tracker
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940]   is that it gives you data that you can make sense of.
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.200]   I've long been a believer in getting blood samples taken,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.940]   and more recently I've become a believer
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.680]   in getting DNA samples taken.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.300]   In order to understand what's going on
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.640]   at the level of hormones, metabolic factors,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.960]   and other things that profoundly influence
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.060]   our immediate and long-term health.
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.440]   The problem always has been getting those samples taken
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.640]   and making sense of those samples.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.160]   Inside Tracker makes all of that really easy.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580]   They'll even come to your home to take the samples.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.200]   Then you get the information back.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.880]   And while typically after getting information back,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.240]   there's these long list of numbers
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.680]   and nobody knows what to do with them,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.200]   Inside Tracker makes it really easy
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   to interpret what those numbers mean.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.080]   And it points to things in terms of lifestyle,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.680]   exercise, nutrition, and so forth
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.600]   that can help you adjust some of the numbers
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.680]   that you might need to bring down or up
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.340]   to put into the appropriate normal range.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.760]   So I find this whole process to be immensely valuable
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.400]   for guiding my health choices
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.100]   and also just for giving me peace of mind
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.880]   about how my body and the rest of my health
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   are doing internally.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.280]   Something you just can't know without a blood and DNA test.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.240]   If you want to try Inside Tracker,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.400]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.880]   and you'll get 25% off any of their programs.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.540]   You want to put Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.780]   So that's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.640]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   and put Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.720]   The third sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.300]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.640]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.480]   I started using Athletic Greens in 2012.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.280]   So I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of the podcast.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.100]   The reason I started using Athletic Greens
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   and the reason I still take it once or twice per day
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.720]   is that I find it very hard to know
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.200]   what vitamins and minerals I need to take.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.840]   And by drinking Athletic Greens,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.440]   I get it all in one easy to consume, great tasting formula.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.680]   I really do like the way it tastes.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.200]   I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon or lime juice
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.260]   and to me, it's delicious.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.920]   The other thing about Athletic Greens
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.320]   that I really like are the probiotics.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.540]   There's so much data out there now telling us,
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.460]   and I certainly believe based on the data that I've seen,
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.220]   that probiotics are really important
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.220]   for support of the gut microbiome, the gut brain access,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.520]   the immune system, and many other aspects of our biology.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.720]   So with Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins, the minerals,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   and the probiotics that I need.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.280]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.720]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.040]   And if you do that, they'll also give you a year's supply
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.140]   of vitamin D3K2.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.400]   Vitamin D3, we also know is really important
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.360]   for things like immune system and metabolic support.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.220]   So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.140]   to get Athletic Greens, the year supply of vitamin D3K2,
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.560]   and they'll give you five free travel packs.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   Today, we're talking all about emotions.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.000]   Emotions are central to our entire experience of life.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   Whether or not we're happy or sad or depressed or angry
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.240]   is our life experience.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.800]   And yet, I think with all the importance
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.140]   that we've placed on emotions,
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.960]   very few people actually understand how emotions arise
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.180]   in our brain and body.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.640]   And I mentioned brain and body because as you'll see today,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.280]   emotions really capture the brain-body relationship.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.300]   We cannot say that emotions arise
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.720]   just from what happens in our head.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.840]   It also involves events, biological events,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.120]   chemical events within our body.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.440]   The other thing about emotions is that
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.060]   there's no real agreement as to what's a good emotion
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.880]   or a bad emotion.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.680]   Today, we're going to talk about the biology
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.880]   of the chemicals and pathways that give rise to emotions.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I'm going to equip you with several, if not many tools
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.120]   that will allow you to regulate and change
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.220]   and steer your emotions should you want,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.440]   but not using the typical advice.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.660]   Everyone's probably heard of this thing,
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.480]   "Oh, if you're feeling depressed, just smile.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.180]   It's impossible to be depressed while smiling."
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.280]   Look, if that were true,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.820]   we wouldn't have any depressed people
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.440]   because depressed people don't want to be depressed.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.280]   And it is not the case that simply smiling
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.520]   will reverse depression or sadness.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.000]   And it's simply not the case
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.640]   that smiling can inhibit sadness.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.380]   It just doesn't work that way.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.540]   However, it is the case that certain things
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.800]   that are happening in our body
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.020]   influence how our brain functions
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.360]   and the chemicals that are released.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.420]   And today we're going to talk a lot
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.340]   about how the brain and body interact
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.480]   to create these things called emotions
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.880]   in the context of food and nutrition.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.200]   And the reason we're doing that
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.600]   is not because I'm beating the drum
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.640]   about particular diet regimens or anything.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.960]   In fact, I'm not going to do any of that.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.080]   What I'm going to do is I'm going to review
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.040]   some of the most important scientific data
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.280]   that point to how ingesting certain nutrients,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.520]   both macronutrients like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.800]   as well as micronutrients can impact the chemicals
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.240]   in our brain that give rise to the feelings
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.520]   of being happy or sad or sleepy
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.880]   or alert when you want to be sleepy
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.720]   or sleepy when you want to be alert.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.480]   So this is sure to be a broad discussion
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.120]   and yet we're going to get very specific
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.280]   about what emotions are, how they arise in the body,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.600]   tools that one can use
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.620]   in order to better control their emotions,
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.340]   tools that people can use to, believe it or not,
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.980]   feel happier or feel calmer.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.880]   And that's because in the last 20 years or so,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.540]   there's been an explosion of scientific studies
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.040]   exploring how the brain and body interact
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.520]   to support certain neurochemicals
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   that give us these feelings of being alert and happy
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.580]   or depressed or certain that our life is going to be terrible
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.760]   or certain that our life is going to be great.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.620]   So as mysterious as all that might sound
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.040]   and confusing as all that might sound,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.820]   we're going to make it very clear today.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.820]   And you're going to come away from this conversation
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.500]   with a lot of tools that you can act on immediately.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.880]   And those tools are grounded in scientific data.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.000]   We are going to provide links to several of the studies.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   And I'm going to mention several of those studies
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.020]   as we go along.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.880]   But overall, the goal today is for you to understand
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.960]   how moods and emotions arise
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.900]   and the different pathways in your brain and body
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.180]   that allow them to happen
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.540]   and how you can use those pathways to change those emotions
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.480]   and the tools that you can rely on in very specific ways
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.440]   to shift from being, say,
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.240]   slightly depressed to feeling happier.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.340]   There actually are ways to do that,
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.480]   or from feeling too alert and anxious to feeling calmer.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.700]   And these are tools that are distinct
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.660]   from the tools I've talked about in previous episodes.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.260]   The discussion around emotions has a long and rich history
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.580]   going back to Darwin, and even long before Darwin.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.260]   This is a conversation that philosophers and scientists
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.740]   have been having for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.980]   The idea that Darwin put forth
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.060]   and that was really attractive for about the last 100 years
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.640]   was that emotions are universal
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.140]   and that some of the facial expressions
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.840]   around emotion are universal.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.540]   And other people have capitalized on that idea.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.160]   And to some extent, it's true.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.920]   I mean, I think that the two most robust examples of that
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.380]   would be when we see something or we smell something
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.260]   or we taste something that we like,
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.620]   there does tend to be a postural leaning in.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.100]   We tend to inhale air at that time.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.700]   We tend to bring in more
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.420]   of whatever chemical substance is there.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.740]   So we tend to do these mmm and kind of lean in closer
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.780]   to things that are attractive to us.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.280]   And when we see and experience things that we don't like,
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.860]   sometimes it's a mild aversion.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.620]   We just kind of lean back or look away.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.700]   Other times it's an intensive version of disgust
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.340]   and we tend to cringe our face.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.700]   We tend to avoid inhaling any of the chemicals.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.860]   This probably has roots in ancient biological mechanisms
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.540]   that are to prevent us from ingesting things
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.580]   that are bad for us,
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.460]   chemical compounds and tastes that might be poisonous.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.740]   So much of the foundation of any discussion about emotion
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.920]   has to center around this kind of push-pull
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.700]   of attraction to things or aversion from things.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.560]   Now that's a very basic way of thinking about emotions.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.740]   But if you think about it,
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.920]   it works for a lot of different circumstances.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.080]   And in the brain,
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.260]   everywhere from the deep circuits of the brain
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.900]   to the more kind of what we call higher order evolved
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.260]   centers of the brain, we have this push-pull thing.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.860]   We're either, in a previous episode, I talked about GO,
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.440]   the circuits that allow you to emphasize action
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.500]   and then no-go circuits,
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.860]   the circuits in the basal ganglia
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.300]   that allow you to de-emphasize action and prevent action.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.080]   We talked about how that's a push-pull.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.860]   So aversion and attraction is a push-pull too.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.620]   Delight or happiness or excitement are attractions
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.500]   to certain things and ideas, songs, people, places, foods.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.420]   Aversion is a leaning out.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.180]   It's a disgust, it's an avoidance.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.540]   And so we can break down the discussion about emotions
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.500]   into these simpler versions of themselves.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.540]   But at the core of that, of attraction or aversion,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.900]   is an important theme that you might realize already
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.760]   but most people tend to overlook,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.180]   which is that there's an action there.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.700]   You're either moving forward
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.860]   or you're moving away from something.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.660]   And anytime you're talking about action
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.820]   in the nervous system, you're talking about motor behaviors.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.660]   You're talking about literally the contraction of muscles
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.620]   to move you toward or away from things.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.220]   And anytime you're talking about nerve to muscle and action,
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.740]   you're talking about the brain and the body
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.260]   because the brain can't move itself.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.580]   The brain has a body so that the organism can move.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.300]   And the body has a brain so that the organism, you,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.100]   can move toward or away from things
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.380]   that you deem to be good or bad for you.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.340]   Now, some of these things that we're attracted to
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.840]   and some of them that we avoid
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.380]   are what we call innate or hardwired.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.900]   You know, when we taste bitter compounds,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.780]   I'm not saying about bitter,
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.260]   like you like a little bit of bitters in your drink
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.380]   or something like that, but really bitter compounds,
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.420]   we tend to avoid those
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.480]   because they're associated with poisons.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.960]   When we taste things that are sweet or that are savory,
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.700]   we tend to pursue more of those.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.140]   We tend to lean toward those, so to speak.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.100]   And we tend to not avoid them.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.720]   So there are circuits in the brain for aversion
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.340]   and for attraction toward things.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.200]   And the body is governing a lot of that.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.160]   And so immediately in this conversation,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.320]   I want to raise an important point,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.600]   which is about a nerve pathway
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.720]   that many, many people have heard of
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.200]   that gets discussed all the time.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.320]   And that is one of the most kind of oversold
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.440]   for the wrong reasons and undersold, unfortunately,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.840]   for its real power, which is the vagus nerve.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.540]   So the vagus nerve is one, not the only,
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.420]   but one way in which our brain and body are connected
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.880]   and regulates our emotional states.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.220]   Now, many of you have probably heard
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.520]   about polyvagal theory.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.000]   I'm going to talk about this today.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.280]   Polyvagal theory was popularized by Stephen Porges.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.600]   And it's an interesting theory.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.480]   Certain aspects of it, frankly, hold up to the science.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.800]   Some of it doesn't.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.780]   And I'm going to discuss all of that today.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.040]   A lot of the vagus and the excitement about the vagus,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   V-A-G-U-S, is because it somehow got into the mind
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.140]   of the public that the vagus is involved in calming us down.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.540]   So what is the vagus nerve?
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.680]   Okay, we're going to make this really simple.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.240]   In particular, for those that are just listening,
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.260]   you can just imagine this.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.540]   For those of you that are watching,
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.800]   I'll point to the various areas.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.840]   But basically, vagus is the 10th cranial nerve,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.060]   which basically means that the neurons,
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.160]   the kind of the control center of each of those neurons
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.100]   in the vagus lives just kind of near the neck, right?
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.560]   And a branch of the vagus goes into the brain.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.180]   They send a little wire into the brain.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.240]   The other branch goes into the periphery,
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.920]   but not just the gut.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.700]   It goes into the stomach, the intestines, the heart,
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.640]   the lungs, and the immune system.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.700]   So this vagus nerve is incredible
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.060]   because it's taking information from the body
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.320]   and it has two directions.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.200]   The first is what we call sensory.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   So it's sensing things that are happening
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.880]   in the gut, in the lungs.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.120]   Everything, for example,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.640]   in the lungs when our lungs are distended,
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.160]   the vagus nerve senses that
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.600]   and sends that information up into the brain.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.540]   It also can sense things in the gut,
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.900]   like how distended or empty your stomach happens to be.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.280]   It can sense heart rate.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.920]   It can sense your immune system,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.320]   whether or not you have bacteria
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.580]   or things invading you in your body.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.520]   So it sends that information up to the brain.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.480]   So it's a two-way street
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.740]   and sensory information is going up to the brain.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.480]   That's all vagus.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.400]   So it's like a super highway.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.840]   Sensory information going one way.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.120]   And then the other direction is motor control.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.160]   So the vagus is not just for sensing things,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.520]   it's actually for controlling things.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.000]   It's got a sensory pathway and a motor pathway.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.120]   So that's the first thing I think everyone should know
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.000]   about the vagus.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.560]   In fact, it's so important
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.160]   that I feel like this is as important as people knowing
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.800]   that walking involves flexors and extensors.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.380]   And if you don't think that's important,
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.280]   it's as important as walking frankly,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.840]   because the vagus is the way in which you can govern
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.620]   the brain-body connection
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.600]   and in which you can steer various aspects
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.760]   of your mood and wellbeing.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.200]   But most people just don't understand how to use it.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.920]   So first you got to understand what it is.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.520]   So you've got sensory information coming
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.080]   from all these different organs of the body up to the brain.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.460]   You got motor information going
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.080]   from the brain back to the body.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.520]   And so you've got this super highway within you.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.080]   Now what actually regulates the vagus?
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   Oftentimes you'll hear things like,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.200]   oh, this particular behavior,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.880]   rubbing your face at a particular location
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.120]   or breathing in a particular way,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.560]   or a warm bath or something stimulates the vagus.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.180]   Well, right now I want everyone to know
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.640]   that "stimulating the vagus" broadly speaking
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.920]   is a terrible way to think about the vagus.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.420]   Because did you know what?
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.260]   If you have a contaminant inside your body,
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.200]   the vagus senses that
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.320]   and projects that information to your brain
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.600]   and you start to generate a fever.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.980]   You start to try and kill that contaminant in your body.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.120]   So I don't know that you want to stimulate the vagus
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.460]   just as like a general theme.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.920]   Today we're going to get specific
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.200]   about how you can activate particular circuits,
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.180]   certain pathways from certain organs to the brain
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.680]   in order to feel better or relieve certain conditions.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.880]   But you certainly don't want to just stimulate the vagus.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.340]   Now, excitement about the vagus in part
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.680]   is because of what quite honestly
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.760]   was a fairly pioneering theory about the vagus,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.320]   which is polyvagal theory.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.120]   So polyvagal, the word poly means many,
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.280]   is cool because it acknowledges
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.160]   that the vagus has a lot of different branches.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.760]   It's not just one thing.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.100]   And so I really like that.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.100]   I like the naming polyvagal.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.660]   The idea that Portis put forward
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.840]   was that there's a dorsal vagus,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.200]   which is kind of runs the back of the spinal cord,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.520]   which is involved in alertness and activation
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.560]   and kind of fight or flight type stuff.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.600]   And that there's a ventral pathway
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.760]   and that that's involved in more kind of empathic behaviors.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.480]   That is not quite in agreement with the modern anatomy,
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.700]   but he was doing the best with what he had at the time.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.240]   So, okay.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.840]   The problem I have with the polyvagal theory
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   is the way that it's discussed.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.600]   People will often say,
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.620]   oh, if your dorsal vagus is too active,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.520]   then you tend to be someone who's a little too keyed up.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.420]   And people who are kind of in a state of freeze
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.420]   or kind of flaccid and kind of like just not really active
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.960]   and they're just lethargic,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.000]   well, then that pathway is hypoactive.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.240]   It should be more active.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.600]   So there are a lot of theories
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.680]   about how psychology maps onto the vagus
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.340]   that as far as I know, don't map to any real physiology.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.760]   Now, the other problem with this kind of the way
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.720]   that the polyvagal theory is discussed,
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.160]   probably not by the real experts, but by a lot of people,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.240]   is that people start to diagnose different psychological
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.740]   and physical manifestations through the vagus.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.700]   They would say things like,
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.060]   oh, this person is hyper-flexible at the joints
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.020]   and therefore their dorsal vagus isn't active enough
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.120]   or something like that.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.080]   And it's really kind of gone way outside the lane lines.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.280]   So today we're going to clean up a lot of that.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.460]   Let's make it really simple
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.160]   about how the vagus actually works,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.040]   at least as we understand it today in 2021.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.360]   First of all, as I mentioned, you have sensory information,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.440]   the same way that you detect light with your eyes
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.460]   or you hear sounds with your ears,
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.560]   you have sensors in your gut
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.580]   that sense how full or empty your gut is.
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.520]   It can also sense how acidic your gut is.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.620]   It can sense various things within your gut.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.740]   Your heart is doing the same.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.820]   It's informing the brain how fast your heart is beating,
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.040]   how full your lungs are has been communicated,
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.060]   and then the status of your immune system.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.740]   So the way to think about the vagus
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.820]   is the same way I would think about the eyes.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.780]   The eyes are looking at colors, they're looking at motion,
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.120]   they're looking how bright it is.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.980]   And each one of those things, those features,
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.340]   is telling the brain something different.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.680]   So the brain can decide when to be awake or asleep,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.320]   whether or not it's looking at somebody attractive
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.680]   or unattractive.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.840]   The vagus nerve is also analyzing many features
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.320]   within the body and informing the brain
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.860]   of how to feel about that and what to do.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.220]   So a really good example that I think is an exciting one
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.940]   is as it relates to sugar.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.340]   So we all know that sweet things generally taste good.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.460]   I'm not particularly a fan of very sweet things.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.440]   I'd much rather have cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.320]   I like savory, fatty foods, but I do like sweet foods.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.980]   And most people find sweet foods to be attractive.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.820]   They want them.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.660]   Or they might not be able to regulate their behavior
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.520]   around them, but they want them.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.940]   And what's really interesting is that for hundreds of years,
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.660]   people have thought that that's because of the way
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.720]   that sweet foods taste.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.780]   So that makes sense, right?
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.440]   You eat something, it tastes sweet, you want more of it.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.460]   Well, it turns out that it's much more interesting
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.300]   than that.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.940]   When you eat something sweet, within your stomach,
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.800]   you have cells, neurons that sense the presence
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.060]   of sugary foods independent of their taste
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.740]   and signal to the brain.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.260]   So those sensors, those neurons send information
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.900]   up the vagus to your brain, goes through a series
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.540]   of stations, and then you release dopamine,
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.820]   this molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.380]   that you just ingested.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.440]   In fact, this pathway is so powerful
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.620]   that they've done experiments where they completely numb
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.640]   all the taste and feeling in somebody's mouth.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.440]   They're blindfolded so they don't know what they're eating.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.820]   And they're eating a food that's either sugary
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.980]   or not sugary.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.600]   And what they find is that even though people can't taste
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.220]   the sugary food, they crave more of the food
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.020]   that contains sugar because of the sensors in the gut
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.460]   that sense sugar.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.660]   So to put this differently, you actually have sensors
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.100]   within your body that make you crave sugar independent
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.240]   of the sweet taste of those things.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.540]   Now that's incredible.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.300]   And what it does and what it tells us is that we have
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.260]   circuits in our body that are driving us towards
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.200]   certain behaviors and making us feel good,
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.220]   even though we can't perceive them.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.940]   Now, for those of you that are really interested
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.800]   in gut intuition and kind of gut feelings,
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.180]   this is a gut feeling,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.280]   except this is a chemical gut feeling.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.620]   This is a particular set of neurons detecting that something
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.620]   in your body has a particular feature, in this case,
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.100]   the presence of sugars and sending information to the brain
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.020]   to essentially to control your behavior.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.140]   And I find this remarkable because what it means is that
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.980]   what we call attractive isn't always coming from our
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.580]   thoughts about that, or our feelings or even our perception.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.100]   We are drawn to particular foods and we're drawn to perhaps
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.580]   also to particular people, places and other things
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.900]   because of information that's coming from our body.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.140]   And we're gonna talk about what one can do
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.980]   with this information.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.860]   I know many people are thoughtful or concerned about
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.220]   sugars these days thinking, you know,
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.720]   we all ingest too much sugar.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.060]   There's sugar snuck into all the things we eat.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.140]   And indeed that's true.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.160]   I mean, this should completely reframe the way
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.560]   that we think about the sort of so-called hidden sugars
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.400]   in foods.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.780]   What this means is that even if a food is very savory,
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.660]   like a piece of pizza or a piece of bread,
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.480]   or even like a salad dressing,
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.140]   if there's sugar snuck into that and you can't taste it,
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.460]   you will still crave more of that thing without knowing
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.560]   that you crave it because it has sugar.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.500]   In other words, you might find yourself wanting
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.540]   certain foods and not knowing why you want those foods.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.420]   So I find this to be a fascinating aspect of our biology.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.880]   And yes, it relates to mood and emotion.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.220]   And we'll talk about how that is in a moment.
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.320]   So let's just back up a bit and ask the question,
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.640]   why do we eat certain things?
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.440]   And why do certain foods make us feel good
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.040]   and other foods actually make us feel anxious?
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.680]   I think some people may be familiar with this,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.060]   other people might not,
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.700]   but most people don't realize that as you approach eating,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.240]   there's an anxiety associated with that.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.080]   It's an alertness.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.380]   Remember in the previous discussions,
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.000]   or even if you don't and you haven't seen those,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.180]   all of your moods and feelings of wellbeing
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.160]   are anchored on this continuum of alertness versus calmness.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   And we hear so often about rest and digest,
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.880]   that, oh, after we eat, we feel really nice and full,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.500]   hopefully comfortably full and not too full,
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.240]   and we're relaxing and we feel satiated.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.440]   It's associated with serotonin, this molecule of satiation.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.080]   That's all true.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.720]   But what most people don't know is that
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.200]   there's an area of the hypothalamus,
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.160]   so deep in the brain, kind of in the middle,
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.640]   deep portion of the brain, called the lateral hypothalamus.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.200]   And the lateral hypothalamus is really interesting
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.800]   because it controls feeding, but it inhibits feeding.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.940]   It stops us from feeding.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.120]   And there's another area in the brain,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.480]   if you want names, I'll give them to you.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.120]   If you don't want names, just ignore them,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.740]   delete them from your memory and awareness,
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.120]   called the locus coeruleus.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.360]   Now, the locus coeruleus sits back further
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.640]   in the brainstem and it releases norepinephrine,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.240]   which is essentially adrenaline, and makes us feel alert.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.480]   Now, locus coeruleus has a lot of different functions
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.660]   in the brain, but when we are going to eat,
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.000]   let's say we walk into a restaurant,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.960]   we sit down or we're preparing a meal,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.440]   locus coeruleus is known to release
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.080]   norepinephrine in the brain.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.160]   It's creating a kind of alertness.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.320]   This has ancient utility, but it's creating this alertness.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.100]   And for many people, they experience that
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.060]   as they approach food as stress, as anxiety.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.820]   But what's interesting is that as we approach food,
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.040]   locus coeruleus is releasing all these molecules
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.460]   that make us feel more anxious and alert.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.100]   Sometimes it's felt as excitement,
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.260]   and that has probably to do
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.820]   with how we feel about food generally.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.820]   Are we happy with our relationship to food?
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.840]   Are we trying to restrict our relationship to food?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.220]   Are people coming over for dinner?
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.060]   All that will play in, of course,
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.900]   but there's a certain stress and anxiety
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.880]   on approach to food.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.200]   And as we approach food and we feel that anxiety,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.160]   locus coeruleus activates the lateral hypothalamus
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.640]   in a way that inhibits feeding,
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.180]   that makes us not want to eat.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.040]   So a lot of people who have kind of pre-meal anxiety
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   or anxiety around food,
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.560]   and they can't seem to just calm down and have a good meal
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.200]   to access that later rest and digest,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.800]   a lot of that is because of this heightened stress
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.160]   upon approach to food.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.700]   And a lot of the tools that are out there,
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.860]   both for eating disorders
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.760]   and for just kind of the general public
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.560]   who isn't suffering from eating disorders,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.180]   things like mindfulness around meals.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.020]   They always tell you,
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.480]   "You should never eat when stressed."
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.180]   I'm sorry, but my life is not organized
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.380]   in a way that I can't do that.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.700]   I would never eat, right?
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.140]   Because I eat when I'm awake,
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.060]   and I don't know if I'm stressed,
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.840]   but I don't think I am,
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.260]   but I tend to run around a lot during the day.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.180]   I don't generally take time
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.320]   to do two or three deep breaths before I eat.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   I generally will just keep, will eat.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.840]   That can be healthy or unhealthy
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.140]   depending on the quality of your digestion.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.680]   I think using digestion as a guide is good.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.300]   But a lot of people aren't aware
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.760]   that this interaction between locus coeruleus
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.560]   and lateral hypothalamus is a basic mechanism
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.760]   where we are supposed to get a little bit alert
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.040]   and anxious around mealtime.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.880]   And then as we eat,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.320]   the mechanisms for calming and satiation
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.760]   are supposed to kick in.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.560]   And those mechanisms involve,
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.020]   as I mentioned earlier, two things.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.400]   One is how things taste.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.240]   Digestion starts in the mouth, of course.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.140]   We taste our food.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.080]   Everyone tells us we should chew our food more.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.440]   Yes, that can improve digestion.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.600]   We're not supposed to drink too many fluids as we eat.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.920]   That's true too.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.580]   But a lot of how we feel while we eat
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.960]   and after we eat is because of this
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.440]   vagus sensing of what's in our gut.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.880]   It's sending information all the time.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.640]   Is there sugar?
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.180]   Are there fats?
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.200]   Are there contaminants?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.600]   There are a lot of information,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.940]   these so-called parallel pathways
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.180]   that are going up into our brain
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.300]   that regulate whether or not
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.360]   we want to eat more of something or not.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.840]   And there are accelerators,
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.760]   things that make us want to eat more,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.920]   like sugar and fats,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.400]   because those are nutrient dense
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.620]   and they helps generally, at least in the short term,
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.120]   support the survival of animals,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.120]   but also amino acids.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.520]   And this is very important.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.540]   There are a lot of data,
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.200]   but much of what comes from the data
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.840]   on what people eat and how much they eat
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.500]   is from a subconscious detection
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.140]   of how many amino acids and what the array,
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.640]   meaning the constellation of amino acids is in a given food.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.600]   And it's fair to say that the sum total of these studies
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.140]   point in a direction where people will basically eat,
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.780]   not until their stomach is full,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.500]   but until the brain perceives
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.840]   that they have adequate intake of amino acids.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.380]   Now, this is a conversation that comes up
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.740]   in the context of the meat only, the keto,
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.860]   the kind of zone diet, the Mediterranean diet,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.700]   the vegan diet.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.600]   I'm largely going to ignore the kind of strict camps today.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.100]   I will talk a little bit about it
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.400]   because I think each one of them
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.220]   actually taps into something important
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.700]   about this brain-body relationship
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.540]   that the other ones don't.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.220]   But I don't want to get into a discussion
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.420]   about the ethics of different foods
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.860]   of animal-based or non-animal-based
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.260]   'cause that's not the topic today.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.740]   It's really about nutrient sensing and amino acid sensing.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.820]   So we generally will eat until our gut tells our brain
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.460]   that we have adequate amounts of these amino acids.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.300]   Amino acids, of course, are important
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.780]   because they are the building blocks of sure,
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.500]   muscle and the other things in our body that need repair.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.380]   But what most people don't realize
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.600]   is that amino acids are what the neurochemicals
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.800]   in the brain are made from.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.260]   Now, this is vitally important, okay?
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.060]   So we've heard dopamine is this molecule
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.180]   that makes you feel good.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.760]   Actually, dopamine is a molecule that makes you feel good.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.740]   It's released within the brain
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.460]   and it does feel very good when you have dopamine release.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.720]   Dopamine release is caused by surprise, excitement,
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.860]   events that you're looking forward to and that turn out well.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.380]   It is inhibited by events you're looking forward to
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.840]   that don't work out.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.020]   When someone says they're going to call
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.560]   that you're really, really excited to talk to
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   and then they don't.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.740]   Or you thought a movie was going to be really great
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.580]   and it's not.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.400]   Or you expect a meal to be really delicious
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.060]   and it's kind of eh.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.000]   And we actually, there's a name for that.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.260]   It's called reward prediction error.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.460]   So if, and you can actually use this
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.140]   in the context of meals and plans
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.180]   in a way that's very useful with yourself
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.820]   and people you know.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.340]   Essentially, if you expect something to be really terrific,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.660]   it really does place a higher expectation
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.080]   at the chemical level.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.600]   So if you don't get as much dopamine
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.980]   as you're expecting from something.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.860]   So you hear about a really great restaurant
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.400]   or a place that has a really, in my case,
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.300]   I wouldn't call it an addiction.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.020]   I would call it more of an affliction for croissants.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.260]   The best vegetable of course is the croissant.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.180]   And I get really excited about the fact
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.300]   that someone will tell me, oh, there's this place
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.820]   and they have incredible croissants.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.780]   You got to go there.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.340]   So I get really excited and I'll go
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.540]   and just them telling me that it's going to be
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.020]   really terrific raises an expectation,
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.780]   a dopamine expectation.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.980]   And unless those croissants are amazing,
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.420]   chances are I'm going to experience them
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.300]   as less good, less satisfying.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.440]   I will truly release less dopamine
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.000]   than I would had they just said,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.100]   oh yeah, I think that there are croissants down the street
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.720]   or if I just tried one at random.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.260]   And that's because of this reward prediction error.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.660]   Your expectation of something releases dopamine
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.040]   and the actual event releases dopamine.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.520]   And if the event related dopamine
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.740]   does not exceed the expectation or at least match it,
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.240]   there's a much higher tendency
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.500]   that you won't pursue that thing again.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.120]   So dopamine is really powerful
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.320]   and it's not just the molecule of reward.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.960]   It is the molecule of desire.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.100]   It's the molecule of wanting,
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.420]   not just the molecule of having.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.580]   And a book, since people often ask for book recommendations,
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.760]   I don't know the author personally, but I love the book.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.340]   It's called "The Molecule of More."
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.720]   It's a terrific book.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.760]   I wish I had written it frankly,
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.580]   but if you want to learn more about dopamine,
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.100]   reward prediction error and how dopamine regulates
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.820]   various aspects of your emotional and motivational life,
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.000]   it's a terrific read.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.700]   Dopamine is what's going to lead us
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.500]   to want to eat more of something
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.140]   or to not want more of something
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   because dopamine really is about craving.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.120]   It's about motivation and it's about desire.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.440]   And as I mentioned, these amino acid sensors in our gut
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.780]   are detecting how many amino acids,
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.300]   but they're also detecting which amino acids.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.600]   And there's a particular amino acid called L-tyrosine,
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.920]   which comes from food.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.860]   You can look up online which foods contain L-tyrosine.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.660]   It is in meats, it is in nuts.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.200]   It is also in some plant-based foods.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   L-tyrosine is the precursor to a couple other molecules
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.580]   like L-DOPA, et cetera, that make dopamine.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.260]   And so there's a misconception out there
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.400]   that most of the serotonin is in our gut
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.540]   and most of the dopamine is in our gut
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.880]   and therefore our mood is in our gut.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.060]   That's not quite the way it works, okay?
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.500]   We'll talk about serotonin in a moment,
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.160]   but dopamine is synthesized
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.900]   from the amino acids that you eat.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.200]   However, the dopamine neurons that give rise
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.380]   to these feelings of good or wanting more
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.640]   or desire and motivation, those reside in the brain.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.900]   So we don't want to get too confused.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.700]   We want to respect and honor the power of the gut
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.140]   and this vagal pathway,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.740]   but it's really neurons within your brain
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.660]   that drive the pursuit and decision-making.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.620]   So what does this mean?
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.460]   Well, some people make too little dopamine.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.940]   Some people make so little dopamine
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.300]   that they need prescription dopamine.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.260]   They need L-DOPA.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.380]   People with Parkinson's take L-DOPA
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.420]   and other compounds to increase dopamine
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.900]   because Parkinson's is associated
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.900]   with deficits in movement.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.660]   It starts as a tremor,
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.460]   actually starts as some other things that are interesting
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.440]   we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.540]   but Parkinson's is a depression.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.640]   It's a blunting of motivation and mood and affect,
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.540]   and it's a tremor.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.220]   And then eventually in severe conditions,
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.340]   it's challenges in speaking and walking.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.420]   So some famous examples would be Muhammad Ali,
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:41.280]   Michael J. Fox, the great boxing trainer, Freddie Roach.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.240]   Like these people have Parkinson's
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.160]   and they at least later in their life
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.780]   had challenges speaking.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.380]   Now it's not just fighters that develop Parkinson's.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.640]   As far as I know, Michael J. Fox wasn't a fighter.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.980]   People can develop Parkinson's
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.660]   and Parkinson's is a depletion
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.160]   of dopamine neurons in the brain.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.100]   And it's not just movement challenges,
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.620]   it's challenges with mood.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.900]   Now, hopefully most of you,
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.400]   all of you don't have Parkinson's,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.380]   but it's clear that dietary L-tyrosine
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.380]   supports the healthy production of things like dopamine
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.340]   and as well as other factors within the brain.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.000]   Now, some people immediately ask,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.820]   well, should I supplement L-tyrosine?
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.000]   So let's just talk about that
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.160]   because that's going to come up.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.600]   Full disclosure, I sometimes take L-tyrosine.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.640]   I'm not taking it right now,
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.500]   but I take it only occasionally.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.540]   You can buy this in capsule form.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.560]   It does increase kind of mood and elevation and alertness.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.680]   It is over the counter.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.940]   You have to check with your doctor.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.420]   I'm not responsible for your healthcare
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.940]   and I'm not a doctor.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.980]   Whether or not it's safe for you.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.920]   People with preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.840]   like mania should probably not take L-tyrosine.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.340]   The other thing about taking L-tyrosine
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.060]   is there is a crash, okay?
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.300]   It's not a massive crash
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.220]   if you take it at appropriate doses and it's right for you,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.020]   but it can produce a crash and a lethargy
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.540]   and a kind of brain fog after the next day or so.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.100]   And so L-tyrosine, however,
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.700]   can be ingested through foods or through supplementation
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.880]   to increase dopamine levels.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.020]   That's well known.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.660]   Taken chronically, however,
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.900]   it can disrupt those dopamine pathways.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.060]   Now there are other drugs that will increase L-tyrosine
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.540]   and dopamine as well,
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.620]   but those are severe enough
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.680]   that they generally tend to have addictive properties.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.600]   So things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.760]   are terrible because they really ramp up
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.460]   the dopamine system so much
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.060]   that people really can't achieve dopamine release
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.660]   through any other mechanisms.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.900]   But food and the ingestion of L-tyrosine
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.880]   has a profound effect on our levels of dopamine.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.160]   It takes a little while,
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.400]   but that really will impact level of mood.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.060]   Certain antidepressants fall into the category
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.020]   of dopaminergic antidepressants.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.020]   One of the most famous ones, of course, is Wellbutrin.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.560]   Wellbutrin was developed
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.960]   because a lot of the other antidepressants
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.060]   tend to make people feel kind of lethargic
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.860]   or they had side effect profiles that people didn't like.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.580]   So they developed this thing
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.060]   that the generic name is different,
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.760]   but it's generally called Wellbutrin.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.840]   Wellbutrin activates dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.700]   which is a substrate of dopamine,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.820]   and both of those are involved in motivation
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.380]   and alertness and effort.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.240]   So you might say, wow, this sounds like a great drug.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.640]   However, this drug, the side effect profile
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.320]   tends to be the things that are associated
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.980]   with elevated mood and alertness.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.100]   So this isn't like taking some L-tyrosine,
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.180]   this isn't like eating some tyrosine rich foods,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.740]   this is really a much greater release
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.380]   of dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.900]   and it increases things like anxiety, sweating,
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.380]   the pupils dilate.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.820]   It has certain effects on, in particular,
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.260]   people with epilepsy.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.760]   It's been used somewhat successfully for smoking cessation,
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.380]   but again, it's not for everybody,
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.100]   and I'm not here to encourage the use of these things,
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.460]   I'm just describing the biology
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.680]   and the rationale for why these drugs were developed.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.400]   So let's back up a second.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.040]   Let's just kind of take stock of where we're at.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.560]   We have a brain-body connection.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.600]   There are many of them,
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.560]   but one of the main ones is the vagus nerve.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.020]   The vagus collects information about a lot of things,
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.380]   breathing, heart rate, stuff that's happening in the gut,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.600]   et cetera, and gut, by the way,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.420]   includes the stomach and the intestines,
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.700]   sends that information up to the brain.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.420]   The brain is using that information
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.140]   to decide one of two things,
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.620]   move towards something or move away.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.640]   It can also pause,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.460]   but essentially pausing is not moving toward.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.860]   So that's the dopamine pathway,
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.480]   and foods rich in L-tyrosine generally give us
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.900]   an elevated mood and make us want to do more
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.100]   of whatever it is that we happen to be doing,
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.220]   as well as other things, motivation generalizes
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.060]   to other things.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.260]   It's not unique to just ingesting foods,
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.040]   but foods that give us a big pulse of dopamine
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.940]   will make us crave more of that food.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.220]   It will make us crave more of the activity
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.900]   that led to the ingestion of that food.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.980]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.860]   a lot of that is happening at a subconscious level
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.140]   that you're not even aware of.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.220]   And this is why I think the concern about hidden sugars
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.740]   and over-ingestion of sugars is serious
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.180]   because it's not just that the sugars are impacting
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.180]   our blood glucose in negative ways,
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.380]   although often it is,
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.260]   it's not just the obesity crisis that's happening,
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.700]   it's also the fact that it's disrupting
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.220]   our dopamine systems.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.340]   Now that doesn't mean all sugar is bad.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.420]   Some people have a quite healthy relationship to sugar,
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.060]   but I think most people are just not aware
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.700]   that sugar isn't just operating at the level of taste,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.580]   it's operating at the level of neurochemicals
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.940]   and it's doing it subconsciously.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.120]   So I'd like to talk about some of the other pathways
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.700]   between brain and body that regulate our moods and emotions,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.820]   but also are actionable.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.200]   So the other neuromodulator that's really interesting
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.280]   in the context of the vagus is serotonin.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.660]   Serotonin, just to remind you, is a neuromodulator,
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.160]   therefore it creates a bias in which neural circuits,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.140]   which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.440]   and it makes it less likely
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.000]   that other ones are going to be active.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.660]   I think it's fair to say without ever having measured it
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.480]   that my bulldog Costello, just his brain and body
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.140]   must be swimming in serotonin because he's very calm
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.300]   and he eats a lot, but he generally feels pretty sated.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.700]   He's kind of an animal that's obsessed with comforts.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.180]   He's a bit of a hedonist.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.800]   And serotonin, when it's elevated,
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.100]   tends to make us feel really comfortable
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.980]   and kind of blissed out wherever we are.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.480]   And that contrast with dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.180]   which mainly put us in pursuit of things,
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.260]   motivation is pursuit.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.500]   Serotonin is more about feeling really comfy where we are.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   The conversation around the brain-body relationship
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.420]   and mood in serotonin for many years was,
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.000]   well, you eat a big meal, the gut is distended,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.980]   you've got all the nutrients you need, you rest and digest,
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.820]   and serotonin is released.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.880]   That's sorta true, but there's a lot more going on
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.240]   and a lot more that's interesting
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.060]   and actionable that's going on.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.100]   First of all, some of you, but perhaps not all have heard
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.800]   that more than 90% of the serotonin that we make
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.020]   is in our gut.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.860]   And indeed, we have a lot of serotonin in our gut.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.180]   We have neurons in our gut that make serotonin.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.940]   We have neurons in our brain that make serotonin.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.940]   But here's the deal.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:11.540]   Most of the serotonin that impacts our mood
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.600]   and our mental state is not in our gut.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.720]   Most of it is in the neurons of the brain
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.060]   in an area called the raphe nucleus of the brain.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.860]   There are a few other locations too.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.340]   And those are the neurons that control
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.700]   whether or not we feel satiated or not,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.000]   whether or not we feel happy and calm.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.280]   You can't have a discussion about serotonin
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   without having a discussion about antidepressants
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.420]   because during the late '80s and early '90s,
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.700]   there was this explosion in the number of prescription drugs
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.640]   that were released, things like first one
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.500]   and most famous one is Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil,
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.260]   a number of other ones that are so-called SSRI,
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.420]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.720]   That's a long acronym, but basically those drugs work
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.240]   by preventing the gobbling up of serotonin
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.400]   or reuptake of serotonin into neurons
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.380]   after it's been released,
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.560]   which leads to more serotonin overall,
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.120]   which means to elevate serotonin.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.200]   And indeed those drugs were and can be very useful
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.680]   for certain people to feel better in cases of depression
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.080]   and some other clinical disorders as well.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.900]   So I really don't want to dismiss them as useless
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.660]   or dangerous for everybody.
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.620]   They can be quite useful for many people.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.480]   Not everyone responds well to them
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.140]   as I'm sure you've all heard.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.880]   And their side effect profile
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.760]   has effects like blunting affect.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.180]   It can make people feel kind of flat, kind of meh.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.800]   It can reduce appetite for food.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.320]   It can reduce appetite for sex.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.400]   It can do all sorts of things or it can work really well.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.720]   Sometimes it's a dose related issue, et cetera.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.000]   Serotonin is fascinating, however,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.480]   because how well those neurons in the raphe work
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.880]   is impacted by some events within the gut.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.800]   Although you might be surprised
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.280]   to find out what those events are.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.100]   So let's go a little bit deeper into the gut.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.740]   And again, the gut includes the stomach
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.840]   and then the small intestine and the large intestine
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.400]   and ask like, what is going on with serotonin in the gut?
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.600]   How is it impacting serotonin in the brain?
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.960]   And let's think about this in the context
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.480]   of how some of us might want to increase
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.280]   or decrease our serotonin levels.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.340]   So as far as I know,
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.980]   there aren't any really good at home blood tests
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.240]   for things like serotonin and dopamine.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.880]   There are some commercial products out there,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.120]   but to me, just to me, I'm not particularly impressed.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.960]   It's not the same as getting your hormones levels measured
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.700]   or your metabolic factors measured.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.320]   That can be done and can be done rigorously.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.440]   There are tests out there.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.960]   There are even some, believe it or not,
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.680]   there's some questionnaires.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.040]   And I think actually last year
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.560]   it made some of the bigger newspapers.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.760]   Are you more of a dopamine or a serotonin?
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.280]   Are you a this or a that?
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.820]   I find that stuff to be a little silly,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.160]   although I do appreciate and like the fact
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.220]   that people are thinking about
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.460]   and talking about neuromodulators.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.760]   There aren't really great ways to measure these things
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.680]   outside the clinic.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.980]   There's some great clinical tools
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.480]   that you can get inside of a hospital
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.720]   or from a proper endocrinologist or neurologist,
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.400]   but no great at-home tool.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.600]   So maybe that's a call to arms
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.320]   for some of you entrepreneurial folks out there
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.120]   to create these tests, accurate tests, please.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.680]   They could be done at home.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.640]   But some people feel like they're too anxious
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.920]   or they're always in a motivated state
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.680]   and they're trying to adjust their serotonin.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.320]   Many people adjust their serotonin by just eating more food
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.160]   and carbohydrate-rich foods will increase serotonin.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.920]   I've talked about this on a previous podcast,
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.700]   but I personally am a big fan, at least for me,
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.780]   as I usually fast and exercise in the early part of the day,
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.420]   I eat a relatively high protein and moderate fat,
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.700]   zero carb or low carb meal at lunch
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.460]   and in the afternoon to stay alert
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.760]   because those foods tend to favor dopamine production,
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.820]   acetylcholine production, epinephrine production
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.940]   and alertness.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.480]   My mood is generally pretty good most of the time.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.240]   And then as evening comes around
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.720]   and I'm concerned about sleep and a good night's sleep,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.980]   not concerned in an anxious way,
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.620]   but I want to get a good night's sleep,
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.600]   I will ingest foods that promote serotonin release
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.500]   because they contain a lot of tryptophan.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   So if I do eat meat,
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.100]   it would be like a white meat, turkey meat.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.500]   I don't tend to, I've never liked turkey.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.160]   I don't mind the animal, but I don't like ingesting the meat.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.840]   But starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.220]   Some people also will take serotonin.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.280]   You can now buy 5-HTP supplements.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.700]   This is a little bit tricky.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.720]   5-HTP supplements can of course increase 5-HTP.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.480]   It is 5-HTP or serotonin,
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.360]   but that sometimes can create problems
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.660]   in endogenous or self-made production of serotonin.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.160]   So I'm never a fan of taking things
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.420]   very close to the chemical you're trying to increase
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.820]   for very long periods of time, maybe for occasional use.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.700]   I have the problem that if I take serotonin supplements,
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.120]   5-HTP, I fall asleep, the sleep I have is very intense
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.620]   and I wake up three or four hours later.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.180]   And we know based on sleep studies
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.660]   with good measurements in the lab
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.040]   that serotonin release tends to be
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.520]   in the later part of the night.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.200]   And so by taking it early in the night,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.240]   it really can disrupt the pattern of sleep
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.440]   and the depth of sleep.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.420]   Nonetheless, some people are interested in taking serotonin
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.980]   to get some of the more blissed out effects.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.760]   You can achieve that with foods, as I mentioned,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.420]   that are carbohydrate rich.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.260]   So as you're seeing,
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.400]   this isn't really a discussion about nutrition per se.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.760]   This is a discussion about food, which contains amino acids.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.440]   Amino acids being the precursors to neuromodulators
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.320]   and neuromodulators having a profound effect
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.360]   on your overall state of alertness or calmness,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.420]   happiness, sadness, and wellbeing.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.600]   So there are a number of things that one can take.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.160]   As I mentioned, one of them being 5-HTP itself.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.520]   Now I'm not recommending people take anything,
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.360]   but if you're interested in what this does
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.640]   and you want to explore this,
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.760]   of course you'd want permission from your doctor.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.680]   You can go to this free website.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.280]   I love this resource.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.660]   They don't pay me to say that, but I just love this resource.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.540]   I followed it for a long time, called examine.com.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.640]   Thank you folks at examine.com
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.420]   for putting this free resource out on the web
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.120]   that has links through what they call
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.040]   the human effect matrix.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   So it's links to all the PubMed studies
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.280]   for particular effects of particular compounds
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.360]   that one can buy and ingest.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.920]   Incredible, as well as important health warnings.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.160]   So I'm not going to read through everything,
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.760]   but if you were to go to examine.com, as I have now,
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.280]   and you'd put in 5-HTP,
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.540]   they're only looking at things that have strong evidence.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.540]   PubMed articles, articles are in the PubMed archives.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.520]   So for instance, I didn't know this,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:44.000]   but 5-HTP produces a notable decrease in appetite.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.360]   Three studies.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.000]   And this appetite suppression makes sense of course,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.440]   because we ingest foods to get serotonin.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.420]   And if we have enough serotonin,
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.700]   then there's no reason to ingest more foods.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.560]   It tends to have a blunting of appetite.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.640]   It probably does that also through other mechanisms.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.160]   So I'm not saying you should do this,
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.380]   but if someone's trying to blunt their appetite,
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.740]   could be a interesting route.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.800]   Although I don't recommend chronic use.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.960]   Not surprisingly, there's a decrease in body weight
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.120]   as a consequence, an increase in cortisol.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.040]   So that's kind of important to note that when you,
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.320]   typically in biology,
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.580]   if you pull on one string really hard, another one moves.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.880]   It's a little bit like a puppet
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.040]   and there's more than one string on the puppet.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.400]   So it does seem to increase cortisol,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.880]   though they report as a minor effect.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.160]   Again, links to all those studies are there,
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.480]   which is why I'm not listing them out in our caption notes.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.280]   You can go and get them at examine.com,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.700]   put in serotonin and you'll find that.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.880]   So I find it fascinating that nowadays,
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.980]   there are things that are somewhere between doing nothing,
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.440]   getting serotonin from tryptophan in foods
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.560]   and prescription drugs.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.080]   There's this other category of supplements
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.840]   that are really interesting for modulating
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.200]   these chemicals in the body.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.180]   And I should mention before I move on,
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.460]   because I mentioned L-tyrosine,
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.480]   I neglected to mention earlier
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.060]   in our discussion about dopamine.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.140]   If you're interested in the dopamine pathway,
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:08.260]   go to examine.com, put in mucuna pruriens,
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   it's M-U-C-U-N-A, P separate word, P-R-U-R-I-E-N-S.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:20.060]   It is a velvet bean that grows from vines
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.460]   and is very itchy to touch due to serotonin on its surface.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.900]   Amazing, this bean has serotonin on its surface.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.060]   And indeed serotonin, if you were to put it on your skin,
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.620]   would cause some irritation of the skin, amazing.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.260]   Inside the bean is L-DOPA.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.780]   Mucuna pruriens is not just something
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.620]   that promotes dopamine release
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.740]   because of some weird mystical ancient thing
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.980]   or whatever, or sorcery, it is chemically L-DOPA,
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.340]   the precursor to dopamine.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.480]   It contains some other molecules as well
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.820]   and low levels of other psychoactives.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.580]   This stuff is available over the counter,
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.240]   incredible, I personally find it incredible.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.580]   Its effects are really interesting,
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.940]   I'm not going to read them all off,
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.460]   but I mentioned these effects
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.220]   not because I'm encouraging you to take it,
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.100]   but because you get a window into what dopamine,
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.340]   acute dopamine increase does
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.840]   in the non-Parkinsonian context.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.600]   And you can start to think about foods
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.580]   that are rich in L-tyrosine
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.100]   as biasing certain effects or not others.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.420]   So when you hear food is medicine,
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   food isn't really medicine, food is food,
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.900]   but food has these chemical effects as well.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:30.900]   So first one listed is three studies with very high rigor
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:35.780]   that overall have a minor effect on,
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.300]   of all things, sperm quality.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.820]   So it appears that sperm motility itself,
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.300]   I'm assuming when they say sperm quality,
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.260]   I don't know what features of sperm of quality
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.100]   they looked at with sperm,
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.740]   that's not a discussion I want to have,
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.240]   but I'm assuming it's motility
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.940]   because I know enough about reproductive biology
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.860]   to know that sperm ability to swim
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.220]   depends on some proteins
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.580]   that are present in the front of the sperm, et cetera,
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.000]   things like pentraxins,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.940]   and sperm motility is generally associated
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.100]   with sperm quality.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:05.620]   Sperm that don't move are generally not very useful sperm.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.260]   Symptoms of Parkinson disease
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.100]   are notably degraded with macuna prurin.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   So fascinating, that's not surprising.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.840]   And there are a lot of other effects here,
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.420]   feelings of subjective wellbeing,
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.860]   testosterone, reductions in prolactin, not surprising.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.240]   Prolactin is a hormone that's involved in milk letdown.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.500]   It's in lactating mothers.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.940]   It's involved in feelings of peace
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.900]   and generally is antagonistic to sexual desire
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.260]   in both men and female.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:37.180]   So it's really interesting that things like macuna prurin,
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.260]   which are L-DOPA, reduced prolactin, increased motility,
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.180]   increased testosterone, subjective wellbeing.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.020]   So you're starting to see a theme, right?
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.180]   Dopamine really makes us motivated, feel in pursuit,
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.220]   makes us feel good.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.760]   Serotonin makes us feel more relaxed and calm.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.540]   Now, this whole month is about emotions.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.940]   So you might be thinking, well, wait,
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.240]   where are we going with all this as it relates to emotions?
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.540]   But in the last episode,
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.860]   I said something I'm gonna repeat it now briefly,
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.120]   which is that much of what we talk about
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.060]   as good emotions or bad emotions,
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.620]   there's a context to that, there's a social context.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.380]   You can't really say an emotion is good or bad.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.500]   Grieving at a funeral is healthy, okay?
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.500]   Being happy at a funeral,
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.580]   assuming you loved the person that died,
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.580]   is most people probably wouldn't think that was healthy.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.700]   So we can't really say that certain, you know,
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.840]   emotions like sadness or happiness are healthy,
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.920]   it's context is important, cultural context is important.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   Many of you have asked for book recommendations.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.100]   This is an opportunity to raise a mention of another book.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.260]   Again, I don't have any financial affiliation or anything,
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.280]   but if you wanna read more about emotions
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.360]   and how the context and cultural things impact our emotions,
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.000]   I'm a huge fan of Lisa Feldman Barrett.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.440]   I learned about her from the Lex Fridman podcast.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.720]   I've had discussions with her on my Instagram Live.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.060]   She's at Northeastern University, a world expert in emotions.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.420]   Her first book is "How Emotions Are Made."
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.580]   This is not a book she sent me.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.640]   I paid for this with my own money years ago,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.740]   bought it, read it, loved it long before I met Lisa.
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:06.760]   I'm just delighted that we've got
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.060]   to known each other a little bit.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.400]   It's a really interesting read
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.940]   into the psychology of emotions
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.740]   and some of the subjectivity of emotions.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.820]   So whereas I'm talking about mainly the biology of emotions,
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.880]   this gets a little bit more into the psychology
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.160]   although the biology as well.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.200]   And Lisa's just terrific.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.560]   She's also putting a lot of information
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.920]   out into the world about emotions.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   So if you wanna learn more about that, check out her work.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.040]   Again, it's Lisa Feldman Barrett
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.120]   and that book is "How Emotions Are Made."
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.520]   Hopefully she'll continue to write many more books.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:41.680]   So now you understand the relationship, I hope,
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.200]   between foods and dopamine, foods and serotonin,
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.920]   and that they're both being communicated
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.640]   to the brain via the vagus, right?
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.100]   We ingest these foods.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.680]   These supplements are things people take.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.520]   They don't put them directly into the brain.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.420]   They put them in our gut.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.660]   So yes, there's a gut-brain connection,
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.760]   but it's not about the serotonin in the gut
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.160]   that makes you feel calm and placid.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.480]   It's not about the dopamine in the gut.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.760]   It's just been oversold that way
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.720]   because I think there's something really attractive.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.160]   And I understand about the idea
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.060]   that because certain things about our experience of life
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.620]   and our emotions is happening in our body,
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.720]   that maybe we have a little more control, right?
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.400]   Because this thing is a hard container.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.100]   We can't just stuff some dopamine in there.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.340]   I can't just let, you know,
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.760]   I could probably take a macuna purines bean
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   and stuff it in my ear.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.600]   Please don't do that.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.520]   It'd make my ear itchy
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.960]   'cause of the serotonin on the outside,
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.480]   but you can't get stuff in there.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.280]   What you have to do is ingest things
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.360]   that are metabolized in certain ways
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.440]   that communicate to the brain,
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.300]   or so maybe they pass into the brain themselves
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.680]   across what's called the blood-brain barrier.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.280]   I'll talk about the blood-brain barrier in a minute.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.800]   It's actually called the BBB.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   So it ends up sounding like baby, BBB.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.900]   I guess that's like BB.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.720]   Anyway, BBB.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.980]   But there are also nerves in the gut
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.680]   that are sensing the nutrient contents of food
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.160]   and then saying, oh, you should feel better and want more.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.880]   Oh, that's got a lot of bitterness and acid taste to it.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.080]   You should want less of that, okay?
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   So as I transition out of the discussion
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.880]   about dopamine and serotonin and the gut,
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.160]   hopefully you've got some actionable items there
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.380]   under your belt, pun intended,
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.960]   where you can understand how certain foods
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.040]   and certain nutrients, and you can look these up,
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.840]   might impact your mood.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.620]   If you're somebody who's really anxious and really wired,
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.900]   well then the dopamine adrenaline pathway,
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.440]   epinephrine pathway is probably not one
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.880]   that you want to lean on any harder.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.320]   If you tend to be someone who's pretty passive
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.740]   and you're having trouble with motivation,
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:44.320]   well then, think about ramping up the dopamine pathway.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.920]   I always think behaviors and proper food choices
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.200]   is the best way to start,
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.340]   and behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.280]   But one of the problems with the discussion
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.200]   around mood and exercise or mood and meditation
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.480]   is that it's so subjective.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.920]   It's like I love certain forms of exercise and not others.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.320]   Certain ones are aversive to me.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.000]   Certain ones are attractive to me.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   And it's never really clear.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.200]   No one's ever told me, okay,
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.760]   you have to do 10 minutes on the bike
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.940]   at X number of RPM at so-and-so or on the skier
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.460]   in order to get your dopamine up.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.680]   But we can actually say if you ingest more L-tyrosine,
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.920]   there's a high probability
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.240]   that you're going to make more dopamine.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.600]   And I'm talking about ingesting it through food
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.460]   or through supplementation, if you like.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.520]   Macuna purines I've tried, I should just mention,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.540]   it was too dopaminergic for me.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.280]   I really, really jazzed up
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.560]   and then severe crash for me the next day.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.320]   But that's, I think, because I tend to ride pretty high
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   on the kind of alertness and motivation scale.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.640]   I'm always being told by Costello
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.960]   and other people in the podcast studio
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.640]   to slow my speech down.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.860]   This is me uncaffeinated and I could probably afford
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.760]   a little more serotonin in my life.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.520]   So whereas Costello, he could afford,
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.440]   well, he could afford to wake up every couple of days
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.680]   and just say hello to us.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.560]   This dog sleeps more than any other creature.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.660]   It's remarkable.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.960]   So there are things that we can do and they're actionable
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.520]   and they are, in some ways they're quantitative
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.120]   because you can regulate dosages
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.500]   and you can regulate amounts and you can regulate timing.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.760]   And everyone has to play with these things
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.400]   and figure out what's right for them in terms of feeding.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.680]   And everyone has to explore
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.760]   and understand what's safe and right for them.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.000]   But, and of course, exercise is still very important.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.320]   I talked about social connection in the last episode,
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.800]   super important for activation of serotonin.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.040]   But when it comes to this gut brain,
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.440]   body brain relationship, what we eat really matters
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.960]   in terms of the neurochemicals that we make.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.120]   So let's talk a little bit more about things
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.680]   that we ingest in our body and then allow our body
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.280]   to inform our brain to shift our mood.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.800]   And this is something I've been doing for years
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.080]   and I just want to say,
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.560]   I've found to be a complete game changer.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.120]   There's excellent science to support it.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.960]   And I think most people are familiar with it
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.100]   in a different context,
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.460]   but I don't think most people know this simple fact,
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:08.460]   which is that the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.600]   has a profound effect on depression.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.160]   It has a profound effect on mood.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.040]   So much so that in a double blind placebo controlled study
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.220]   that I will provide the link to,
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.300]   this was a study first published in 2008,
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.200]   but there've been many others as well.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.740]   First of all, in an experiment done in animals,
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.940]   they found there's a model of learned helplessness
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.780]   in animals.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.840]   Not very kind to the animals,
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.680]   but they put rats or mice in a jar.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.440]   They let them swim and they'll swim, swim, swim
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   to try and save their life.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.560]   And eventually they give up.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.460]   It's a learned helplessness.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.680]   They don't let them drown, they take them out.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.140]   Adjusting the omega-3 omega-6 ratio
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.620]   so that the omega-3s are higher
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.900]   led to less learned helplessness,
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.080]   meaning these animals would swim longer.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.660]   Now that's an animal that's a rat,
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.940]   not a particularly kind study,
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:01.440]   but that same study was essentially done in humans,
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.680]   although they didn't have them swim
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.500]   to the point of near drowning.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.700]   What they did is they took people
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.580]   who were clinically depressed, major depression, okay?
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.540]   Major depression is severe maladaptive state,
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.900]   meaning it inhibits job, relationships, appetite,
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.620]   all sorts of negative health effects.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.940]   And they did a comparison
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:26.300]   of 1,000 milligrams a day of EPA.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.300]   So EPA is one of the elements
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.300]   that contains high levels of omega-3s
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.820]   that's in things like fish oil.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.060]   Talk about other sources in a little bit,
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.520]   but it wasn't 1,000 milligrams of fish oil.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.760]   It was 1,000 milligrams of EPA.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.220]   Compare that to 20 milligrams of fluoxetine,
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.480]   which is Prozac, okay?
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.440]   Really increases serotonin.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.280]   And in this study of 60 individuals,
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.980]   again, I'll provide the links to the study,
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:59.540]   they found that they were equally effective
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.260]   in reducing depressive symptoms.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.060]   So imagine that.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:07.820]   A food-based compound that you can't make without, right?
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.300]   This is not a situation
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.980]   where you can make your own omega-3s.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.360]   You have to get them from food sources
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.020]   or from supplementation was as effective
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.440]   as 20 milligrams of fluoxetine
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.380]   over the course of eight weeks.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.560]   And what was really interesting in addition to that
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.320]   is that the combination of 1,000 milligrams of EPA
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.500]   and fluoxetine had a synergistic effect
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.300]   in lowering depressive symptoms.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.540]   I find this remarkable.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.380]   I heard about this when it first came out
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.020]   and I wasn't sure what to make of it
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.380]   'cause there are a lot of studies that come out
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.740]   and I generally like to focus my changes in behavior
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.700]   around things where there's a large center of mass.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.180]   There's a lot of information.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.100]   A couple of years later,
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:52.100]   I did in fact start taking 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.300]   in fish oil.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.020]   Now, there are a few side effects of fish oil.
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.820]   People who have blood, who are bleeders,
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.280]   who have factor V Leiden mutations,
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.620]   or women who are taking birth control,
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.260]   which can affect blood clotting and things of that sort
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.340]   really should talk to your doctor,
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.080]   make sure it's okay for you.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.900]   Fish oil also can give people fishy breath,
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.060]   which is pretty gross, frankly.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.180]   But there are now fish oils
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.340]   that either because of the encapsulations
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.960]   or because they put some lemon flavoring in there
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.620]   doesn't have that effect.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.020]   In any event, 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.720]   I started ingesting that regularly.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.620]   I just felt better.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.840]   I wasn't clinically depressed,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.700]   but I generally, I did feel, at least for me,
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.780]   an increase in mood and affect
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.060]   and a number of other things.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.340]   It's supposed to reduce inflammation.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.340]   The cardiovascular effects are controversial.
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.180]   For a long time, everyone thought
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.060]   the effects on platelets were really terrific.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.080]   Then there were articles that came out in major newspapers
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.660]   saying maybe not so much,
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.800]   but the effects on mood are really profound.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.140]   And now there are lots of studies.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.520]   If you go into PubMed and you were to put EPA
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.280]   or fish oil and depression,
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.040]   you would find that there were a number
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.660]   of really impressive results
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.700]   showing that it's at least as effective
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:11.620]   as certain SSRIs antidepressants at these dosages.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.860]   And it can amplify or improve the effect of low dosages
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.300]   of some of these SSRIs.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.220]   So I feel like more people should know about this.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:21.220]   This is nutrition, but it's profoundly affecting mood.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.140]   And depression is terrible, right?
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.100]   Depression can have a component of anxiety in some cases
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.660]   where people are, they feel lousy and very uncertain.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.700]   That's kind of how I talk about depression with anxiety
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.500]   is you talk to someone who's anxious
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.300]   and you can tell them everything's going to be okay, okay.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.420]   And they're always concerned
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.380]   about what they might not know.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.300]   You don't really know the plane isn't going to crash.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.860]   You don't really know that life is going to go okay.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.920]   And in some sense, they're right.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.700]   No one has a crystal ball or can predict the future,
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.940]   but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.420]   And then of course, there are the versions of depression
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.080]   that involve certainty.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.540]   People are lethargic and they're certain.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.860]   They say, yeah, I'm certain
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.960]   I'm never going to get another job.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.580]   I'm certain I'm never going to meet anyone new.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.740]   I'm certain I'm going to fail.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.480]   So there's this kind of a divide in the sphere of depression
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.820]   around certainty and uncertainty.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.680]   But what's interesting is this thousand milligrams per day
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.420]   or more of EPA has been shown to relieve
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.280]   both forms of depression.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.500]   Now, does that mean it's going to work for everybody?
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.660]   No, I'm not here to try and play psychiatrist.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.520]   I want to point you in the direction of these manuscripts
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.140]   so that you can make informed choices for yourself.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.140]   You can discuss it with your doctor and family
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.420]   and make the choices that are right for you.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.540]   But here's what's especially interesting
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.480]   about the heart effects,
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.860]   because we've heard that these omega-3s,
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.860]   which of course you can get from other sources too.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.700]   You can get from fatty fish, there are flax seeds,
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.840]   hemp seeds, there are a number of chia seeds,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.940]   these kinds of things.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:51.340]   But the levels of EPA that are required are quite high.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.580]   So this thousand milligrams per day,
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.140]   that's pretty hard to get from food,
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.480]   although it can be done depending on what you're eating.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.480]   What's interesting is that the heart effects that are solid,
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.700]   that really stand up in the literature,
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.860]   have a lot more to do with something we talked about
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.620]   in a previous episode and I'll mention again,
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.620]   which is heart rate variability.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.980]   So we know that having a heart rate that's really high
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.580]   or a heart rate that's really low,
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.020]   neither of those are good.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.720]   A lot of people think, "Oh, you just want a low heart rate,
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.660]   "big stroke volume."
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.060]   You know, if you're running a lot,
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.180]   you may have 30 or 40 beats per minute.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.460]   That's great to be in shape,
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.720]   but you still want heart rate variability.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.340]   It has a lot to do with the tone
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.220]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.140]   I talked about last time how when you inhale,
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.260]   it speeds up heart rate.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.840]   When you exhale, it decreases heart rate.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.580]   That's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.980]   It's the basis of heart rate variability.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.500]   We'll maybe do a short post about this
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.340]   so you can get all the mechanism
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.900]   and the behaviors that spill out of that
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.180]   that might be useful for you.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.760]   But the point is heart rate variability, HRV, is good.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.860]   And what's interesting is that there was a study in 2009
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.580]   that showed that people who eat a diet
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.500]   and fail to supplement in a way
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.240]   that there's a high omega-6 to 3 ratio,
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.260]   so not enough omega-3s,
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.620]   not only are there markers
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.980]   of inflammatory cytokines elevated,
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.500]   things like IL-6 and TNF-alpha,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.540]   but they tend to be non-responders to antidepressants.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.900]   Shifting that omega-3 omega-6 ratio did a couple things.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.660]   First of all, increasing the amount of EPA,
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.580]   shifted the ratio so it was higher omega-3 to omega-6 ratio,
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.380]   which was good, lowered the inflammation markers,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.500]   and then allowed antidepressants
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.000]   to have their effect even at low doses.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.060]   And here's the really interesting thing.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.060]   It worked by increasing heart rate variability.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.700]   And you think, well, how in the world would this happen?
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.720]   But I mean, that's a ton of effects.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.620]   But the way it works is because of the way
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.540]   that these things are impacting the gut
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.980]   and the autonomic nervous system.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.020]   Remember, earlier I said the vagus
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.080]   includes connections from the heart
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.780]   signaling about sensory information
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.340]   about how fast the heart is beating to the brain,
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.560]   not just stuff from the lungs,
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.580]   but information from the heart.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.400]   And the brain then adjusts heart rate
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.140]   by heart rate variability.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.280]   So it's incredible that there's a way
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.080]   that one can use the gut,
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.260]   the ingestion of more of these EPAs,
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.280]   either through food or supplementation,
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.980]   to increase heart rate variability
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.800]   and thereby to improve symptoms,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.060]   meaning reduce symptoms of depression,
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:28.540]   and to even make low levels of antidepressants
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.480]   that wouldn't otherwise work work.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.640]   And I think I like this study so much
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.400]   because A, it's super cool.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.140]   It bridges the brain-body axis.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:39.420]   It incorporates nutrition and micronutrients in the brain,
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.080]   but also because it really points to something
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.460]   that we hear all the time,
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.140]   which is that our body is a whole system.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.180]   It's working as a whole system,
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.980]   and the brain isn't working in isolation
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.400]   up there in the skull.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.800]   It's reacting to things that are happening in the body,
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.180]   in the gut, and in the heart rate,
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.380]   and heart rate variability,
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.660]   and that the things we ingest
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.500]   can have a profound effect on them.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.260]   Now, of course, I really want to emphasize something,
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.780]   which is that no one compound,
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.700]   or nutrient, or supplement, or drug,
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.580]   or behavior for that matter,
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.380]   is going to be the be-all, end-all
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.820]   of shifting out of depression,
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.760]   or improving one's mood, or improving sleep.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.540]   It's a constellation of things.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.140]   And this is especially true
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.460]   when people start to get excited
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.680]   about supplements and drugs of all kinds,
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.300]   and their potential for various things.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.700]   Right now, there's a lot of excitement
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.500]   about psychedelics and their therapeutic uses,
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.400]   and I think, great.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.820]   But as a good friend of mine,
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.560]   who's a physician clinician, says,
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.220]   "Better living through chemistry
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.380]   still requires better living."
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.260]   You cannot expect to take a compound
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.640]   regardless of source or potency,
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.760]   and have it completely shift your experience of life
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.660]   without having to continue to engage
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.860]   in the proper behaviors, all the things we know,
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.440]   proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.380]   There are many others as well.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.820]   So I still find that this collection of studies
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.180]   about omega-3 to omega-6 ratios to be profoundly important,
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.740]   so much so that it's completely changed
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.420]   the way that I think about food, the foods I eat,
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.260]   I do supplement,
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.780]   I don't necessarily think that's for everybody,
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.740]   but I really think it's incredible
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.700]   that there are these compounds
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.140]   that have these robust effects
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.640]   on our feelings of wellbeing, and there are others too.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.340]   So that 1,000 milligram per day threshold
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.580]   of fish oil that's beneficial
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:28.740]   requires that one take a reasonable amount of these things,
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.840]   either through food or through supplementation.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.980]   I acknowledge that not everyone wants to take fish oil.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.780]   There are a couple reasons why one might want to avoid that.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.060]   One would be for ethical reasons.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.060]   You have an emotional relationship
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.020]   or a relationship to the environment
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:47.660]   that makes you not want to ingest fish-related products.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.940]   There's krill oil, krill is still an organism.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.380]   It's a little tiny thing that whales eat a lot of
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.080]   and people generally eat very little of.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.100]   So krill is out there.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.500]   I personally, just me, I don't know why,
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.660]   I didn't react well to krill.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.060]   It didn't make me feel very good.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:05.580]   I had some like kind of skin itchies and things like that.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.940]   And they stopped when I stopped taking it,
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.980]   but I don't want to bias you against it
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.920]   if that's your preference.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.260]   Some people really like krill oil as a source of omega-3s.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.340]   I did mention some of the other sources
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.180]   like chia seeds and flax seeds.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.720]   But as you'll notice, these are not things
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.600]   that we tend to ingest a lot of on a regular basis.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.640]   It is possible to get omega-3s from meats
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.540]   if the animals have grazed on grasses
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.040]   that contain a lot of omega-3s.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.540]   So for those of you that ingest meat,
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.220]   the source of those meats is going to be very important
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.160]   as it relates to omega-3s.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.500]   Even within the category of fish oil,
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.360]   there's a concern sometimes about mercury
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.020]   and other contaminants.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.700]   You want to go with a brand that emphasizes
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.820]   that they've gone to really good sources
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.500]   and that they decontaminate regardless.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.680]   And so you have to search out those brands.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.600]   There is a test that you can do as to whether or not
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.300]   the fish oil is rancid or not.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.980]   Some people take in liquid form.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:06.380]   Some people take in capsule form.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.780]   The liquid form is going to be more affordable.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.820]   The capsule form is a little easier and a little more
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.640]   portable.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.700]   You can actually just chew one of the gel tablets.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.800]   And if it tastes really fishy and kind of rancid,
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.060]   you'll know it's disgusting.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.420]   You'll want to spit it out.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.340]   And if it doesn't and it's tolerable,
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.860]   then you'll know that it's okay.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.240]   Unfortunately, you have to buy it first
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.080]   in order to do that.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.940]   Although, I don't know, maybe you can get them
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:33.140]   to open up the bottle for you in the store
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.660]   and tell them that you don't want to try it.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.420]   Someday, perhaps, fish oil and omega-3s,
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.040]   it'll be like tasting wine at a restaurant
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:39.960]   where you can send it back.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.260]   For now, I think you have to purchase it first,
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.460]   but find a brand you trust and like
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.260]   and then work with them
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.500]   if you decide to go that route, of course.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.220]   There are other compounds that are also interesting
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:56.220]   for mood elevation that are essentially like foods
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.500]   or are supplement-based that now, fortunately,
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.160]   there are really good data from peer-reviewed studies.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.700]   And the next one I want to mention,
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.340]   'cause I think it's really interesting, is L-carnitine.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.300]   Now, L-carnitine has been around a long time
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.720]   and it's been discussed in the context of heart health
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.560]   and a number of other things.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.460]   It was actually touted as a bit of a weight loss agent
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.460]   in the early '90s, but L-carnitine
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.660]   actually has some really impressive effects on depression.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.020]   And again, we will look to PubMed
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.260]   because looking at examine.com is essentially,
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.780]   for me anyway, looking at PubMed, what is L-carnitine?
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.020]   L-carnitine is most prevalent in meat
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.660]   and in beef in particular.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.460]   Now, for the vegans, please know that L-carnitine
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.140]   is available through non-meat sources as well,
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.940]   although it's not as enriched in non-meat sources.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.700]   It's a really interesting molecule
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.900]   because L-cetyl L-carnitine
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.540]   is essentially what's made from L-carnitine,
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.420]   but it's acetylated.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.940]   If you're interested in the biochemistry,
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.760]   you can look that up.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.840]   It's acetylated into a form
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.380]   that can cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.260]   The blood-brain barrier or BBB is a barrier.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.820]   It's a wall around the brain.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:11.280]   And you have this barrier because the brain is so important
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.300]   and it has this feature that the neurons there
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.500]   don't recreate themselves after injury.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:16.980]   Like other organs of the body,
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.980]   there's not a lot of turnover of cells
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.500]   despite what you might've heard.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.180]   And so nature has created this BBB,
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.860]   this blood-brain barrier to make sure
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.660]   that certain molecules, in particular large molecules,
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.900]   don't get across the blood-brain barrier
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.020]   'cause it can be damaging to those tissues.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.960]   Incidentally, you also have a very rigid
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.240]   or stringent barrier around other organs,
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.120]   which are the gonads.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.920]   So the ovaries and the testes and the brain
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.680]   are the organs of the body
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.780]   that nature has gone out of its way to protect,
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.900]   give this additional layer of the blood-brain barrier,
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:54.820]   or as you might imagine for the testes and the ovaries,
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.520]   it's going to be the blood gonadal barrier.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.820]   So these barriers exist and make it such
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.620]   that just because you eat something,
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.580]   just because you ingest it,
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.900]   doesn't mean it's going to cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.420]   But L-carnitine, when taken,
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.520]   is acetylated and converted into this form
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.700]   that gets across the blood-brain barrier.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.200]   And it has a lot of effects.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.940]   It's involved in mitochondrial activation
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.300]   of long-chain fatty acids,
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.060]   which that's a big mouthful that we can get into sometime
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.660]   when we're talking about metabolic.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.780]   But it has some interesting effects on the neuro side.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:28.600]   So if you decide to check it out on examine.com,
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.760]   you'll see some really interesting things.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.960]   Lots of effects on ammonia, C-reactive proteins,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.980]   things of that sort, blood glucose is lowered, et cetera.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:39.620]   That's all stuff that's the level of blood in periphery,
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.720]   slight effects in lowering cholesterol.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.120]   Here's some interesting ones.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.200]   Rates of pregnancy go way up
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.140]   when people are taking L-carnitine,
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.840]   both the father and the mother,
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.260]   both the source of sperm and the source of egg
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:59.660]   are affected in ways that favor pregnancy.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:02.260]   It does increase, here we go again with sperm quality,
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.640]   sperm motility in males,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.340]   and it seems to have positive effects on females
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.080]   that have polycystic ovary syndrome.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.100]   So check that out.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.780]   The effects are very strong.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.300]   There are three studies listed there.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.060]   Again, I'm not promoting this,
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.340]   but that people take L-carnitine,
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.180]   especially if you're trying to get pregnant.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.040]   But check it out because the effects there
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.320]   and the studies that are mentioned
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.220]   are published in peer-reviewed rigorous journals.
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:34.240]   In terms of the neural effects, those are quite interesting.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.180]   The effects on depression are still emerging,
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.780]   but they do seem to exist,
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.940]   that people feel a notable decrease in depressive symptoms.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.500]   There are seven studies listed on examine.com
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.960]   that it has a notable benefit in a variety of circumstances
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.740]   where participants have heightened depression already.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:55.420]   They start taking L-carnitine and they start feeling better.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.780]   And they talk about dosages in those various studies.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.980]   It also has been shown to have a notable decrease
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.400]   in the symptoms of autism, which I find fascinating also.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.600]   Again, the things we ingest impact the chemicals
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.540]   in our brain and how they impact the rest of our body.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.920]   There's other things that's been used
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.480]   to treat certain forms of alcohol dependence.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.740]   I think this is going to be
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.300]   a very exciting emerging area.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.940]   We're going to do a whole month about addiction.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:23.260]   I've got a great guest lined up for that month,
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:27.060]   but there's now an emerging field
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.400]   about what people can take and supplement
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.860]   to help ease the cravings and the withdrawal
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.660]   when trying to quit drugs of abuse, like cocaine, alcohol,
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.100]   heroin, and smoking, and things of that sort.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.700]   So really interesting area.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.740]   This is, I like to think is early days,
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.900]   and then we're going to discover a lot more.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.300]   There's a huge list of things here.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.180]   Since we talked about pain in a previous episode,
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:52.140]   and I know a lot of people have written to me
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.300]   about fibromyalgia, it does,
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.660]   carnitine has been shown to reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.340]   Again, all the links to studies are on examine.com,
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.740]   totally free site.
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:05.660]   And that was my bulldog being a battering ram.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.620]   There's nothing graceful about this bulldog.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.840]   He's decided he wanted to leave to go get a drink of water,
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.500]   and so please forgive the noise.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:15.220]   Okay, so now let's turn to another aspect
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:20.140]   of the gut-brain relationship that will surprise you,
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.100]   in some cases might shock you,
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.780]   and that has some really cool and actionable biology.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.780]   And that's the gut microbiome, probiotics, and prebiotics.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.220]   I know today we're talking about emotions and not pain,
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.580]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention another effect
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.020]   of acetyl-L-carnitine that's been reported,
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.500]   and that you can find listed with link to study
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:45.300]   on examine.com, which is its effect in reducing
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.160]   the symptoms of migraine.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.740]   This was a randomized controlled trial
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.300]   with 133 participants who had frequent migraines.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.500]   They were taking 500 milligrams of L-carnitine
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.420]   or nothing for 12 weeks.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.220]   So the control is a little bit,
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.120]   the control experiment there is a little bit tricky,
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.920]   but it had a significant effect on reducing the number
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.340]   of migraine attacks per month.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.460]   So I find that really interesting.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.740]   And there's a lot more listed there about the study.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.260]   And I think these compounds are powerful.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.680]   They carry risks for certain people, not for others.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.960]   So again, you have to find out what's right for you.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.760]   But I do think they are super interesting
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.800]   as potential therapeutics for various people.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.260]   So what's the deal with the gut microbiome
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.300]   and the gut-brain axis?
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.700]   Today we've actually been talking a lot already
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.740]   about the gut-brain axis
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.860]   that has nothing to do with microbiomes.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.180]   We've been talking about this vagus nerve
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:47.380]   that connects providing sensory information
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.820]   from the body to the brain.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:52.560]   And then the brain also sends in the same nerve
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.220]   motor information to control the motility,
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.880]   the gut, the heart rate, how fast we breathe,
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.100]   and deployment of immune stuff, killer cells,
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.300]   and things of that sort.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:08.500]   But oftentimes when we hear about the gut-brain axis,
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:13.100]   these days, it's a discussion about the gut microbiome.
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.220]   And once again, we're in a situation
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.140]   where there's incredible biology.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:20.100]   I'm very happy there's so much discussion
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.780]   about the gut microbiome.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.260]   I am somewhat dismayed and concerned
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.140]   that most of what I hear out there
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:29.440]   is either false or partially false.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.580]   So we're going to clear up some of the misconceptions,
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:34.100]   first by understanding the biology,
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:34.940]   and then we're going to talk about
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.420]   some of the actionable items.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   It is true that we have a lot of these little microorganisms
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:46.200]   living in our gut.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.380]   They're not there because they want to help us.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.660]   They don't have brains.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.440]   They are adaptive, however.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.540]   They try and find and create environments
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.140]   that make it easier for them to proliferate.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.340]   So they don't care about you and me,
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.640]   but they are perfectly willing to exploit you and me
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.180]   in order to make more of themselves,
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.320]   the same way viruses are.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.620]   Viruses don't have a mind.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.660]   They infect cells, they hijack the genome,
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.260]   and they use that genome to make more of themselves.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:19.620]   The microbiota that live in us
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.720]   vary along the length of our digestive tract,
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.760]   but let's just take a step back
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.740]   and think about how our body plan is made.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.660]   We are actually a series of tubes.
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:29.860]   Our brain is actually a tube.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.740]   You see it's all squishy on the outside,
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.980]   and then it's got that long thing,
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.980]   the spinal cord that goes down to the base of the spine.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.420]   That's the central nervous system.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.920]   That all started out as a tube.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.960]   It just looks like a cauliflower on the other end
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.200]   up in the brain because the tube is so big
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.660]   and it has to be crammed into the skull
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:48.200]   so it gets all wrinkled up.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.720]   But if we were to splay it out,
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.280]   you'd find that it's just one big tube.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.200]   Similarly, our digestive tract and our airways
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.660]   are essentially one big tube.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.220]   It starts with our mouth, also our nose,
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:01.640]   and then we have all these other tubes
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.040]   that go down through our throat and then into our stomach
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.300]   and then into our various intestines,
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:10.480]   and then the tube ends out the other end.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.760]   So we are one long tube for digestion.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:16.480]   And inside of that tube is a mucosal lining.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.320]   It's these little microvilli, tiny, tiny, tiny little,
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.000]   like velvety ends of cells that are able to move
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   and move things along, and mucus, mucosa.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.640]   And the conditions of that mucosal lining
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.660]   set a number of different things.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.840]   It sets the rate of our digestion
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.920]   and the quality of our digestion.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.360]   It sets, for instance, our immune system.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.800]   Most people probably don't realize this,
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.080]   but most infections in the environment,
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.080]   well, they have to get into our body somehow.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.400]   Some of them are inhaled.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.160]   A lot of them go into our mouth
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.760]   and lodge in the mucosal lining of the mouth,
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.000]   and then infections start there.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.040]   You probably had the experience, unfortunately,
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.060]   of feeling like you have a tick in your throat,
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.360]   like something's irritating your throat,
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.160]   and then it kind of migrates up into a head cold
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.120]   or a runny nose.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.520]   Sometimes it'll start as a headache.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:08.800]   Sometimes it won't.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.680]   But things that can migrate down into the gut.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:14.720]   So we're ingesting things all the time.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.540]   Think about air, bacteria, viruses.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.440]   They're making their way into our gut.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.920]   And some of those bacteria live in the gut,
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.440]   and some of those bacteria bias the mucosal lining
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.800]   in the gut, stomach and intestines,
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.920]   to be more acidic or more basic
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.140]   so that they can make more of themselves,
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:36.980]   so they can replicate.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.400]   They like a particular comfort.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.840]   It's like they like a particular kind of bedding
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.680]   to lie down in and create more of themselves.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.960]   Now, some of those mucosal linings that they promote
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.200]   make us feel better.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.400]   They make us feel more alert.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.760]   They bolster our immune system,
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.520]   and others make us feel worse.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.520]   So first rule, the microbiome isn't good or bad.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.440]   Some of these little bugs that live in us
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.600]   do bad things to us.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.120]   They make us feel worse.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.520]   They lower our immunity.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.840]   They affect us in negative ways.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.400]   Some of them make us feel better.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.960]   And they do that mainly by changing the conditions
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.680]   of our gut environment.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:21.680]   In addition to that, they do impact the neurotransmitters
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.360]   and the neurons that live in the gut
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.960]   and that signal up to the brain
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:28.960]   to impact things like dopamine and serotonin
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.280]   that we've been talking about previously.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.200]   So there's a vast world now
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.520]   devoted to trying to understand what sources of food,
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.280]   what kinds of foods are good or not good
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.460]   for the gut microbiome.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.800]   So let's just talk about some general rules of thumb
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.040]   related to the research,
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.000]   quality research that's peer reviewed.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.560]   And then in a future episode,
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.540]   we will go far deeper into the gut microbiome
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.040]   and gut brain access.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.140]   But here's a few things
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.200]   that I think you might find surprising.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.740]   First of all, supporting a healthy gut microbiome
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:05.760]   is good for mood, great for digestion
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.560]   and great for immune system function.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:13.240]   However, that does not mean maxing out
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:16.280]   or taking the most probiotic and prebiotic
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.200]   that you can possibly manage.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.740]   As I mentioned many times before,
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.400]   I do believe in probiotics.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.780]   I take probiotics.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:23.920]   But there are studies that show
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.320]   that if you take lots and lots of certain probiotics
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.740]   like lactobacillus and you really ramp up the levels more,
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.040]   it is not a case of more is better.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.120]   There are things like brain fog that can come from that.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.400]   Brain fog is just this inability to focus.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.920]   People feel really not well generally.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.560]   Some of those studies are a little bit controversial
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.100]   but I think it's fair to say that if people
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.880]   really increase the amount of probiotic
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.480]   that they're taking beyond a certain amount,
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.440]   then they start feeling foggy in the mind.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.160]   Now, what's too much?
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.240]   Well, I get probiotics from,
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.760]   I've mentioned before, from athletic greens.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.380]   You can get them from fermented foods
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:07.840]   like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, natto.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.920]   These are different sources from around the world.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.860]   Actually, I'd love to hear some of the other sources
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.740]   that people know, other foods from around the world.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:17.080]   I'm fascinated by the way in which different cultures
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   have all arrived at these foods that provide
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.600]   and support healthy microbiomes because they're fermented.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.760]   I have a colleague at Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.760]   He and I have talked about this.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.880]   I don't want to quote him inappropriately
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.060]   but we've had discussions about it and they've published
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.840]   that the ingestion of fermented foods
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.280]   is one of the best ways to support healthy levels
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.480]   of gut microbiota without exceeding the threshold
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.940]   that would cause things like brain fog.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:51.240]   So foods and fermented foods are going to be the best source
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.060]   and there are a number of different ways
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:54.900]   that one could do that.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:55.920]   Some people don't like fermented foods,
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.920]   however, some people supplement it.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.760]   So it isn't a case of more is better.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.220]   Okay, so we know that.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:06.920]   The other is that it is true that healthy gut microbiota
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.860]   have been shown to improve symptoms
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.160]   of certain psychiatric illnesses
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.600]   as well as certain conditions like particular features
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.920]   along the autism spectrum, which is interesting.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.880]   And those effects are probably due to not just improvement
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.480]   of immune system function but to the conditions
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.140]   in which the neurons that sense nutrients
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.720]   convey information to the brain
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.280]   and increase levels of serotonin and or dopamine.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.400]   So gut microbiome provides kind of a foundation
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.160]   for healthy gut and healthy gut brain access.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.860]   So much so that some people report
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.440]   that when they start eating small bits,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.640]   'cause it doesn't require a lot of fermented foods,
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.080]   that their overall mood is better.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.560]   Not unlike the effects of EPA,
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.600]   although I don't think it's been looked at
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.760]   directly in the context of clinical depression yet.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.440]   And if someone knows of a study,
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.720]   please mention it in the comments.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.880]   That would be terrific.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.200]   There are some things that you can do
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.540]   to really damage your gut microbiome.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.860]   And this is where there's a huge misconception
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.480]   that I want to clear up.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.580]   There was a study that was published in Nature,
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.260]   which is among the three top journals
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.700]   that we have in Science.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:17.460]   Nature, Science, and Cell are considered the top tops,
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.260]   but excellent journal that showed
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.880]   that artificial sweeteners,
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.440]   but a particular artificial sweetener, which was saccharin,
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.660]   can disrupt the gut microbiome
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.060]   in ways that is detrimental
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:32.120]   to a number of different health markers,
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.500]   increasing inflammatory cytokines
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.720]   and all the other bad things that happen
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.420]   when the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.740]   That study was widely discussed,
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:46.300]   but there were a few things that were not mentioned there
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.700]   that are really important.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.860]   That study was about saccharin in particular.
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:54.620]   Saccharin is not the most typical
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:56.980]   artificial sweetener that's used.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.640]   The most typical artificial sweeteners that are used
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.180]   are things like aspartame, so-called NutraSweet,
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.640]   or sucralose, or these days, stevia.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.860]   There's monk fruits, to my knowledge,
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.900]   and please correct me if anyone knows of any studies,
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:13.420]   to my knowledge, the negative effects
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:17.540]   of these artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:20.100]   were restricted to saccharin.
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:22.580]   Now, there is enough chemical similarity
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.540]   between saccharin and some of the other ones
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.900]   that I mentioned, but not all of them.
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:29.660]   For instance, stevia, monk fruit are distinct
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.660]   in their chemical makeup so that they probably don't have,
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:37.100]   if they have any, have lower effects,
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.780]   negative effects on the gut microbiome,
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.560]   but it should still be tested.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.780]   So saccharin is really, it was shown in this study
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.000]   and several other studies,
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.480]   can really negatively impact, excuse me,
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.680]   the quality of the gut microbiome.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.380]   Interestingly, the narrative around artificial sweeteners
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:58.920]   and gut microbiome is incorrect.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.900]   Most people thought, oh, saccharin is bad for the microbiome.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.840]   It must kill the microbiome.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.480]   And so you hear people saying, oh, you know,
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.300]   artificial sweeteners kill the microbiome.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:09.140]   That's not true at all.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.740]   In fact, in that very same study published in Nature,
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.380]   they showed that the negative effects of saccharin
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.500]   on the microbiome could be blocked or eliminated
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.620]   by giving antibiotics.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:22.260]   So what happens is certain artificial sweeteners,
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:26.260]   in particular saccharin, disrupt the microbiome
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:29.120]   and make the environment within the gut,
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.220]   that mucosal lining, more favorable
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:37.220]   to bacteria microbiota that are not good for the organism.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:40.260]   Okay, this is an important distinction.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:42.800]   It's not just that a language thing where people say,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.860]   oh, you know, it kills the microbiome.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.280]   It doesn't kill the microbiome, it shifts the microbiome.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.420]   And shifts in the microbiome can be good
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:51.340]   or they can be bad.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:53.460]   And that takes us to another topic.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.880]   That's a bit of a hot button topic,
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.780]   but I'm willing to go there
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.080]   'cause I think it deserves conversation,
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.620]   which is nowadays there are many examples out there
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.640]   where people have switched from a kind of standard diet
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   or even a vegetarian diet or vegan diet to a keto diet.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.380]   Now, keto doesn't necessarily have to mean
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.380]   the ingestion of meats, but it can.
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:17.040]   And they experience positive effects for themselves,
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.880]   not everybody.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.980]   And I've talked previously about some of the
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:23.500]   kind of the incorrect,
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.760]   what I believe is incorrect marketing of keto
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.020]   as it relates to the cosmetic effects
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:30.060]   and some of the challenges with sleep that some people have.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.340]   But some people love keto and it works great for them.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.340]   But the ketogenic diet is interesting
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.860]   because when one shifts to the ketogenic diet,
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.720]   there is a shift in the gut microbiome
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.580]   and some people end up feeling better.
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:43.800]   Some people end up feeling worse.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.280]   Likewise, some people go from ingesting animal products,
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.860]   including meat or they're vegetarian and they go to vegan,
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:57.140]   and they experience positive shifts in mood and affect.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:01.940]   And we know that the transition to a more plant-based diet
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:04.420]   and especially the enrichment of fiber
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.660]   that's present in those diets
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.940]   also creates dramatic shifts in the gut microbiome.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.740]   Some people feel better doing that, some people feel worse.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.540]   And of course, it's going to depend on whether or not
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.300]   you're ingesting a lot of processed foods or not.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.940]   There was a paper published in Cell,
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.140]   a Cell Press Journal, obviously, excellent journal,
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.540]   showing that ingestion of processed foods,
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.360]   regardless of whether or not they come from animal sources
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.000]   or non-animal sources,
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.420]   the processed foods themselves
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:33.100]   tend to create activity within the body.
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.960]   And this surely has roots in the nervous system
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.860]   that lead to over-consumption of calories and weight gain,
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:40.940]   even some weight gain that couldn't be explained
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:41.820]   by increased calories.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:43.380]   In other words, processed foods are bad
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:44.640]   regardless of whether or not
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.580]   you're talking about animal products or non-animal products.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.700]   Probably not surprising now,
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.700]   given what you know about these sugar sensing
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.300]   and other amino acid sensing cells in the gut
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.820]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:57.680]   So the point of all this is that when I say
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.240]   you have to find what's right for you,
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.180]   that's not a throwaway statement.
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:06.180]   Some people's microbiome and the lining of their mucosa,
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.800]   excuse me, the mucosa lining of their throat,
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.400]   of their gut, of their nose, everything is improved
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.380]   by diets that are heavily meat-based
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:17.480]   and don't have many plants.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:20.300]   Other people do much better on a plant-based diet
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.480]   without many meat products or animal products.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.900]   It's highly individual.
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:26.660]   And this probably has roots in genetic makeup.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:30.460]   This probably has roots in what people were raised on.
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.900]   Because remember, the nervous system, of course,
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.580]   is set up by your genes, your genetic program,
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:36.740]   but your nervous system,
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:40.300]   it adapts early in life to your conditions.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.140]   That's what it's for.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.420]   The reason you have a nervous system
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:44.620]   is to move your body appropriately
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.820]   towards things that are good for you
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.080]   and away from things that are not.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:50.160]   But also, it was designed to adapt.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.280]   The early life period has this incredible thing
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.260]   about plasticity that we spent a whole month on
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.520]   so that it can change so that, yes, indeed,
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.920]   some people may like certain foods
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.140]   and react to certain foods better than others
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:03.280]   because of the way that their nervous system was wired,
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.460]   this enteric, as it's called, nervous system
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.320]   that lines the gut and that communicates with the brain.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.060]   So most of what I've talked about today
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.560]   is black and white.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.160]   These are things that are present in all of us,
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.560]   the sugar-sensing neurons of the gut,
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.240]   the way the vagus is wired,
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.040]   the fact that omega-3, omega-6s tend to improve,
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.920]   that the ratios tend to impact mood with high omega-3,
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:25.240]   omega-6 ratios improving mood.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.580]   We talked about all sorts of things
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:30.080]   in the gut-brain and body-brain axis.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.320]   But when it comes to the microbiome,
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.740]   the key thing is that we all have a microbiome.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.200]   You want a microbiome,
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.680]   but you want to promote the microbiome
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.300]   that is right for you.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.080]   And that can be shifted and steered
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.320]   by ingesting certain categories of foods and not others.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.120]   And one thing that really frustrates me
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.360]   is when the people show up with an agenda,
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:55.680]   like an all-meat agenda or a vegan agenda or a keto agenda,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.320]   and they talk about these positive effects
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.240]   on the gut microbiome, and it's all true, frankly.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.440]   And so it's highly individual.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.600]   Now, this doesn't get to any of the ethical issues
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.160]   around animals or the planet,
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:10.600]   and you hear rabid debates about that on both sides.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.980]   And I am not qualified or equipped to talk about
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:16.480]   whether or not regenerative agriculture
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.400]   or animal products or farming or any of these things,
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.540]   how those actually impact the environment.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.220]   That is not my expertise.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.520]   But when it comes to your health and your microbiome,
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.040]   you want to support the microbiome.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.460]   It's very clear that these fermented foods
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.040]   support the microbiome,
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.640]   that we should be ingesting at least two servings per day,
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.280]   which is quite a lot.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:38.760]   That supplementation at low levels can be good.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.280]   Supplementation at high levels can create this brain fog.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.240]   Even though some people say that result is controversial,
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.520]   I've experienced this myself,
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.080]   and the data looked to me pretty darn solid.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.560]   So that's one thing to think about as well.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.500]   And the other thing about the gut microbiome
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.160]   is that it's highly contextual
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.700]   based on other things that you're doing.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.440]   So even things like exercise and social wellbeing
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.280]   and connection,
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.280]   those things are also impacting the gut microbiome.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.280]   So find the diet that's right for you
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:10.360]   and that works for you in the context of the other ethical
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.380]   and lifestyle choices that are important to you.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:13.440]   That's my advice.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.980]   A note about fasting.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.160]   I have a colleague at Yale
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:18.040]   who's an expert in the gut microbiome,
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.560]   and he told me something really interesting,
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.000]   which is when we fast,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.880]   we actually digest certain components
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.980]   within our dietary tract.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:33.320]   It actually depletes a good amount of the gut microbiome.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.240]   And this is interesting.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.700]   I've had good results from,
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.120]   I guess you would call it intermittent
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.040]   or kind of circadian type fasting
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.400]   where I've never done long fast,
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.840]   but where I push out my first meal by a few hours.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.640]   My first meal is generally around lunchtime or so.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:49.280]   But the longer periods of fasting
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.240]   that go for a day or two or three days
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.720]   are known to deplete the gut microbiome in major ways.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.120]   And, but that's not always necessarily a bad thing
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.100]   because when it's replenished,
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.440]   it often is replenished at levels
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.600]   that exceeded its previous level.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.200]   But I think that some of the GI tract
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.920]   and even some of the mental effects
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.580]   of returning to eating after feeding,
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.620]   sometimes people don't feel so good when they start eating.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.360]   They really want food, but then they start eating again,
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.240]   they don't feel as good as they did on the fast.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.800]   Some of that may be related to the depletion
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.120]   of the microbiome that occurs during long fast.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.800]   So again, this is something to think about
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.440]   and talk about with your doctor.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.000]   But the idea that fasting across the board is good,
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.320]   there may be some merits to that,
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.700]   and certainly in some cases,
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.640]   but it does deplete the microbiome.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.960]   And that depletion of the microbiome is significant
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.160]   because it means when you return to eating,
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.180]   you're actually not in the same position
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:45.200]   to digest and assimilate those foods.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.060]   And those foods are not in the same position
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.300]   to impact your brain and body
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:50.920]   the same way they were prior to the fast.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.480]   And this is, I think, why people suggest
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.800]   a kind of gradual transition back
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.280]   to consuming nutrients after a fast.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.500]   So as we round up, I want to share some results with you
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:04.680]   that without question will impact the way
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.780]   that you respond to food mentally and even physically.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:11.500]   And I know that because that's the central theme
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.860]   of the studies I'm about to tell you about.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:16.660]   I have a colleague at Stanford, Aaliyah Crum,
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:20.880]   who's done some remarkable experiments on mindset.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.320]   And some people could think about these
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.120]   as placebo effects or belief effects,
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.460]   but they actually go way beyond those terms.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:32.300]   And there are a number of different examples of this
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.440]   that Aaliyah's lab and her coworkers have demonstrated,
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.640]   but two that are particularly interesting to me,
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.700]   I want to share with you now,
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:44.100]   because they really emphasize how our beliefs
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.340]   can really impact the way
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:47.560]   that our brain and body work together.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.080]   I think the most famous of these is an experiment they did
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.100]   where they had two groups of individuals.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.760]   They were each given a milkshake,
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.840]   and they had some factors measured from their blood
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.280]   by an IV while they ingested the milkshake
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.360]   and then afterwards as well.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.760]   And one of the factors that they were looking at
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.720]   was something called ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:13.820]   Ghrelin is a peptide that increases with hunger.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:16.300]   So the longer you haven't eaten, the ghrelin goes up.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:18.740]   And I know some of you say, well, I fast, I fast, I fast,
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:19.980]   and I eventually lose my appetite.
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.140]   Well, ghrelin still goes up and then it drops.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:24.020]   So if you were one of these people
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.180]   that eats every three hours regularly,
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.000]   ghrelin kind of gets a little pulse
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.540]   as you get to that two hour and 50 minute mark.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:32.340]   So it's a little bit of a timer as well.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.760]   It's really interesting peptide.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.020]   In any event, what they did is they gave people milkshakes,
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.580]   two groups, one group got a shake that they were told
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:44.700]   was a low calorie healthy shake.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:48.300]   The other group got a milkshake that they were told
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:52.180]   was the very decadent high calorie shake.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:54.360]   I think it was something like two or maybe even
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.380]   two and a half times as many calories as the other,
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.760]   perhaps even more.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.700]   I don't recall the details,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.220]   but you had a high calorie and a low calorie condition.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.580]   And then they drank the shake,
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:08.440]   and then they measured ghrelin in these subjects blood.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.060]   And what they found was that the high calorie shake
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:15.980]   had a much more robust effect on blunting ghrelin
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.800]   and reducing ghrelin.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.900]   But the interesting thing you probably guessed already
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:24.580]   is that it was the exact same shake given to both groups.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:28.740]   So people's belief about the content of something
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:31.260]   impacted their physiology.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:35.260]   And this speaks to these so-called top-down mechanisms
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.500]   or modulation of our physiology.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.740]   In the previous episode about pain,
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.100]   we talked about the effects of obsessive,
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:44.700]   believe it or not, it was kind of obsessive infatuation
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:47.660]   and love on pain responses and pain thresholds.
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:50.040]   This is yet another example where beliefs
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.940]   or subjective feelings can impact physiology
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.080]   at the level of the periphery,
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.660]   because ghrelin is released in the periphery in the body.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:01.680]   Now, these belief effects extend beyond examples like this.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.440]   Another good example that I'd like to share
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:08.440]   is Ali Dr. Crum and her colleagues did an experiment
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.620]   where they took housekeepers,
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.180]   they were essentially hotel workers,
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.400]   divide them into two groups.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.140]   They had them watch a short film.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.460]   In one case, the film was about how
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.620]   their work was important,
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.400]   it helped people feel comfortable in the hotel,
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.740]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.680]   The other group heard that the activity
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.620]   that they were doing,
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:29.200]   cleaning and taking care of the hotel was good for them,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.620]   it was good for their health, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.940]   They controlled very nicely in the study
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.960]   for health parameters, for individual differences,
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.820]   and for the behaviors of these people
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:43.820]   in the period that followed this short tutorial.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:47.700]   And what they found was eight weeks later,
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.620]   the group that had been told
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.860]   that the activity was good for them
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.500]   showed lower blood pressure,
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.060]   they had lost a significant amount of body fat,
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.620]   and they reported enjoying their work
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.040]   far more than the other group.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.740]   The same work, simply biased mentally
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.500]   by the information that they were given,
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.740]   but their physiology followed that information.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:14.140]   And so this is not just the placebo effect,
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.560]   this is an incredible set of findings
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.140]   that illustrate the extent to which
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:21.000]   whether or not we believe a food is gonna be good for us
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.860]   or not good for us,
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:24.620]   well, we can't escape the reality.
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:26.180]   You can't tell yourself that a poison
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:27.980]   is gonna be good for you and ingest that poison
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.980]   and expect it to not kill you,
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:34.980]   nor can you tell yourself that eating 12 croissants,
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:36.500]   confess I've done it,
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:39.100]   it was after a very long run, a long time ago,
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:40.080]   but you can't tell yourself
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.960]   that that's necessarily going to be good for you
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.940]   or that it's gonna make you lose weight.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:48.040]   These belief effects are not about lying to yourself.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.780]   In these cases, in these experiments, as you'll notice,
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:53.740]   the subjects didn't have prior knowledge
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:56.920]   about ghrelin or about the effects of their daily routine
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.940]   on weight loss and blood pressure.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.080]   So in order for them to work,
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:03.700]   you have to be naive to the information, right?
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.300]   You can't simply lie to yourself
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.740]   and tell yourself what you want to believe.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:12.300]   And that's important, but also important is that the mind
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.780]   and the body are in this fascinating interplay.
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:16.780]   And today we've talked mainly about
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:20.580]   how the body and things that we put inside this tube,
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:24.220]   this that runs from our mouth to the other end,
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:28.040]   to our rectum basically is impacting all these cells,
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.180]   these neurons, microbiota in there,
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:34.080]   mucosal lining, heart, lungs,
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.160]   and how all that information is feeding up to the brain
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.080]   to impact how we feel up here.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.700]   But also how we feel up here
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.380]   is impacting how our body reacts
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.860]   at levels of very core physiology
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:46.820]   that you couldn't just tell yourself
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:47.860]   that this was gonna work,
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:51.100]   but what you believe about certain substances,
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.980]   certain foods, certain nutrients
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.500]   does have a profound effect
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:57.260]   on the magnitude of their impact
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.320]   and sometimes even the quality and direction of that impact.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.160]   Well, first of all,
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:05.240]   I wanna thank everybody for their support of this podcast.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.740]   The response that we've received since releasing
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:10.260]   at the beginning of the new year has been tremendous
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:12.340]   and we're so grateful for it.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.060]   I know some of you and people you know have said,
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.420]   well, it's a lot of information.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.260]   It's like a college lecture.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:19.980]   Indeed, there's a lot of information,
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:24.020]   but I believe very strongly that if you learn mechanism
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.620]   and maybe even if you hear it several times over,
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.620]   eventually those mechanisms become embedded
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:31.460]   into the way that you view an entire topic.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.820]   As well, I always try and put tools
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.460]   as I go along that you can look to immediately.
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.880]   Some of them might be right for you,
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.140]   others might not.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.900]   Try them if you like and don't if you don't want to,
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:44.400]   and if they don't work for you, then discard them.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.520]   If, however, you are finding benefits from the information
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.580]   and from the tools and you know others
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.480]   that you think could benefit from it,
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:55.040]   please pass along information about the podcast.

[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.680]   All those things really help us.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.640]   In addition, if you'd like to support the podcast further,
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.240]   we've set up a Patreon account.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.460]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.140]   It allows you to support the podcast
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:20.940]   at a variety of levels.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.480]   We have the 5HTP, serotonin for $5 a month,
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.560]   the Costello, $10 a month in honor of Costello, et cetera.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.240]   You don't have to, but if you'd like to,
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.640]   that would be terrific.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.480]   In addition, please check out our sponsors
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.600]   that we've mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.880]   That's one of the best ways to help support us.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:41.480]   And we do believe in all the products that we support
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.080]   and our sponsors very much.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.760]   Otherwise we wouldn't be working with them.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.880]   So much so that when I mentioned supplements
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.360]   and I talk about supplements
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   throughout the course of the episodes,
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.800]   I don't mention specific brands,
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.720]   but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.440]   that we have partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.200]   And we've done that because we know
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.640]   that Thorne uses the highest levels of stringency
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.360]   in terms of the products they produce,
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.960]   what they say is in each capsule and tablet actually is,
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.320]   they're used by the Mayo Clinic,
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:15.700]   by all the major sports teams
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:18.480]   because of their level of stringency and rigor.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.600]   If you want to know which supplements I take,
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.600]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.240]   and you can see the supplements that I take
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.520]   and you can get those as well as any of the other supplements
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.160]   and products that Thorne makes for 20% off.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.960]   So it's thorne.com/u/huberman
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.880]   to get 20% off any supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:44.320]   So today's episode, we took a full journey
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.960]   into the brain-body relationship
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.800]   and discussed a lot of the mechanisms
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.760]   and the actionable items that you can approach
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.480]   if you want to explore this aspect
