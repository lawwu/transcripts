[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:13.260]   I took a question from a listener who was talking about closing credit cards to avoid annual fees and I wanted to I had a couple listeners that wrote in with some suggestions on that.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:13.260]   So if you have a credit card with a company and especially this happens if you're playing the mileage game you've a pro you've applied for a premier card and they'll waive the annual fee for the first year and give you a 30% credit card.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:13.260]   You've applied for a premier card and they'll waive the annual fee for the first year and give you a 30% credit card.

[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:43.280]   a premier card and they'll waive the annual fee for the first year and give you a 30% credit card.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   That increases utilization ratio that will lower your credit score that will shorten up the length of your credit history so if you keep that card open it's your it'll improve everything there's no reason to close it except for that $300 annual fee well many with what listeners
