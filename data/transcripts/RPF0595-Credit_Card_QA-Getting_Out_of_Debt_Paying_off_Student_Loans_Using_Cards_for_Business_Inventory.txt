[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.600]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   Today, we talk about credit cards.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.180]   I didn't plan to do any more shows on credit cards
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.980]   for a while, but last Friday,
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.640]   I did a show on a credit card Q&A show.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.620]   And in preparation for that show,
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.880]   I had written to my current students
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.120]   of my newest course called How to Borrow Money Safely
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.320]   and Never Pay Interest using credit cards.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.220]   I'd written to those students and I said,
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.660]   I'll answer all your questions, so call into the show.
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.600]   So I did the Q&A show, the call-in show.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.540]   And after the show, I was looking at my email
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.240]   and I found several questions that I just missed.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.840]   I don't know how I missed them.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.740]   I guess my email didn't download properly.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.900]   Who knows, my fault.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.780]   So I am today, I told my students I would do it.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.320]   So today I'm following through
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.980]   and finishing another Q&A show.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.420]   So I hope you've enjoyed these.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.920]   It's been a great, I've enjoyed covering these topics.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.500]   The things I haven't really seen addressed very much
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.920]   out in the world of personal finance
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.160]   and I hope you've enjoyed it.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.700]   I've had a lot of great feedback
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.740]   from people who have put some of these strategies
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.600]   into action and that's what I love.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.380]   The most important thing to any teacher
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.440]   is to see a student actually doing something
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.780]   with what they have taught.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.520]   Here's a tip to those of you who are younger
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.920]   and who are older.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   The most powerful strategy,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.080]   if you wanna be an effective student,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.500]   the most powerful strategy for you to take as a student,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.960]   be it in primary school, in secondary school,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.140]   in upper university education, advanced education,
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.140]   is ask your teachers what their advice is,
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.340]   what they want you to do, and then do it.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.600]   And then go back to the teachers
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.100]   and tell them how you did what they told you to do.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.800]   What they told you to do.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.700]   Because almost nobody does that.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700]   But if you do that, you'll quickly become the teacher's pet.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.740]   Just like that.
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.040]   I mean, it's a can't lose strategy.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.080]   If you actually do what your teachers recommend,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.040]   you are such a weirdo, you'll be on their radar screen.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.680]   Here's a part number two for those of us
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.180]   who are not students, or excuse me,
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.660]   those of us who are not formally enrolled
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.880]   in formal student teacher relationships necessarily.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.920]   If you wanna bring yourself to the attention
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.160]   of an important business leader, a wealthy person,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.720]   it's very simple.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.840]   One, ask for advice on something that's actually relevant
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   and specific to you.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.560]   That advice can be as simple as,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   what do you think I should do
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.440]   with my money in this circumstance?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.060]   Or what do you think, what book do you think I should read?
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.000]   Or what do you think I should be studying right now?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.240]   Or what should I be paying attention to?
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.060]   I don't know.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.920]   You ask for advice.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   One, ask for advice.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.960]   Two, do what you're told.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.440]   If you do what you're told,
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.160]   and then three, go back and tell the person
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.320]   that you did what they told you to do,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.480]   you are such a weirdo,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.360]   you will stand out on anybody's radar screen.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.080]   So tip for you.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.240]   Back to credit cards.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.760]   I love to hear people taking advice.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.640]   Let me give you an example.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.600]   On the most recent Friday Q&A show,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.440]   sorry, the most recent Friday credit card Q&A show,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.760]   which was the second one ago,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   I had a listener, a student of mine who called in,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.800]   and this student was asking about
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.200]   if they should refinance a portion of their mortgage debt
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.000]   onto a credit card in order for them
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.520]   to be able to remove the PMI,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.000]   the private mortgage insurance,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.720]   from their mortgage payment.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.060]   Their calculation is if they were able to refinance
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.400]   that portion of their mortgage debt
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.160]   to get them down below that 80% loan-to-value ratio
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.760]   such that they could get rid of PMI,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.460]   if they could refinance that over onto a credit card,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.960]   it would save them about $1,500.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   Now, they were also working hard
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.880]   to pay off their credit card debt separately.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.680]   And so we talked through the different strategies
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.800]   and options, and I recommended,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.720]   yeah, I think it's a good idea if you can do it.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.200]   Well, here was the feedback.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.680]   Listener wrote in and said,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200]   "Joshua, thank you for the Q&A.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.280]   "I got approved for two cards in about five minutes.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.760]   "I increased my available credit by 50%
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.940]   "even after including the mortgage principal payment
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.600]   "to get rid of PMI.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.140]   "I also found a better daily use card,
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.160]   "an Amex Blue, which gives me 6% back on groceries
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.360]   "and 3% on gas, up to $6,000 a year.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.200]   "Thank you."
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.720]   Now, here's the cool thing about it.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.600]   Number one, that listener is saving money.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.480]   They're saving money two ways.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.680]   Number one, they are removing the PMI payment
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.280]   from their mortgage.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.240]   That's gonna save them 1,500 bucks.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.000]   Number two, although they didn't tell me
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.040]   all the details of it,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.960]   number two, they're actually gonna be saving money
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.780]   on interest because I bet their effective interest
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.500]   on these credit cards is cheaper
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.940]   than what they're paying on their mortgage.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.620]   So they're saving a tiny little amount of interest.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.380]   They're improving their safety and their security,
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.020]   and they're improving their credit score all at once.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.100]   And when you put all of these things together,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.500]   it's going to help them to get out of debt faster,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.580]   to get their credit card paid off faster
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.140]   because they're spending less money.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   So $1,500 not spent on private mortgage insurance
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.200]   is $1,500 that can be spent
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.480]   on lowering credit card balances.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.480]   And so that's what I call a win, win, win, win, win,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.040]   or win, win, win, win, win, win, win,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.780]   or however many wins you want to insert.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.800]   Which brings me to my first letter
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.160]   that I wanna talk about with you
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.720]   that's not specifically related
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.920]   to a question from a student first.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.760]   Listener writes in and says,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.320]   "Joshua, been a listener for a few years now,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   and I've truly enjoyed your podcast and your ideas.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.800]   Two things I'd like to share though.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.920]   First, I'm a little disappointed in your recent class
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.800]   regarding the benefits of credit cards.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.280]   I didn't purchase the class,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.600]   so I haven't heard all of the material.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.760]   All of the points you made
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.800]   and the portions you shared on the podcast are legitimate.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.440]   However, the last thing Americans need
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.040]   is a reason to use credit cards.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.880]   There's more than enough debt in this country.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.440]   I didn't realize it at the time,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.840]   but when my wife and I carried credit card debt,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.560]   it stressed me out and it stressed our marriage.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.080]   I have to go with Dave Ramsey on this one
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.960]   and argue that debt is generally not good for your health.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.760]   I'm not angry, I'm just surprised that you took this angle
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   and felt like I should give you that feedback."
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.680]   Now, this is a great letter,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.160]   and I know that I have no problem with it.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.600]   I responded to my listener very clearly,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.040]   and it's not a problem in the least,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.400]   but I've received other communication.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   I know that there's a good chance
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.760]   that you've probably thought exactly the same thing.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.960]   Just a couple of quick comments.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.600]   Number one, I tried to be clear,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.640]   and I try very hard to be clear,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.720]   that there are people who should not
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.240]   take my credit card course.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.800]   And those are people who don't have a credit card,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.560]   don't have credit card debt,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.680]   and will never, ever, ever have a credit card
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.880]   or go into debt.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.720]   Now, if that is you,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040]   you are not wrong,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.640]   but you are very rare.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.320]   I repeat, if you don't owe any money,
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.400]   you don't have a credit card,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.440]   you will never borrow money in the future,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   you'll never get a credit card or any other form of debt,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.400]   no matter what,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.640]   you are not wrong,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.720]   but you are very rare.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.600]   I encourage you, maintain your convictions.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.880]   It's going to be very hard for you to get into trouble.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.040]   I can design a few circumstances
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.880]   in which things will not work out as well for you
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.080]   as they might for other people,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.520]   but I could also design other plans
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.200]   that would help you to avoid them.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.960]   For example, I was working with a client the other day,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.160]   and we were talking about asset protection planning,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.120]   and I was talking about equity stripping.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.200]   And one of the valuable ways
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.480]   of doing asset protection planning
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.240]   is to remove equity from certain assets,
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.080]   especially assets that are not otherwise protected,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.200]   in order to reduce their economic value
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   or to reduce their attachableness by a creditor.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.800]   There are three overall basic asset protection strategies.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.080]   One is exemption planning,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.120]   two is asset titling,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.480]   making sure that all your assets are titled
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.800]   on some form of protective entity,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.440]   and then number three is equity stripping
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.360]   or encumbering an asset with debt.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.760]   Now, that's a very useful tool
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.920]   in the hands of a good planner to say,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.800]   "Hey, here's an asset that is exposed
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.480]   "to the claims of creditors.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.760]   "Let's encumber this asset with debt
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.360]   "so that if a creditor were to attack this asset,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.400]   "there would be no equity for them to get.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.160]   "And then let's take that equity
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.480]   "and let's move it over into another space."
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.760]   I was working on this the other day.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.240]   And the point is, in this strategy,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.600]   you can say, "I'm not gonna borrow money."
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.360]   But at the end of the day,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.320]   if you're not going to strip that equity off the asset,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.560]   you've got to use some other plan and some other approach.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.360]   And you can usually do that.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.280]   So I commend to you
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.760]   that if you're not gonna borrow money, great, I support that.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.240]   I encourage you in that, but you're very rare.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.300]   Now, the next thing is to know this.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.720]   Ignorance of how things work
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.480]   is not necessarily a virtue.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.740]   For example, I recently, I shouldn't even,
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.920]   I should be a little circumspect about that.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.560]   Let me put it this way.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.120]   I read things about things that I will never do,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.280]   but I still wanna know about them.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   I still am interested in them.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.480]   And I still feel like the strategies
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.240]   or the ideas are applicable.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.120]   And so that's one of the things
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.000]   that I always hold to with education.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.580]   Ignorance is not, it's not a virtue.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.680]   Just because I know how to screw my creditors out of debt,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.440]   out of all the money they've lent me,
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.580]   doesn't mean I'm going to do that.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.400]   But I also need to know how the systems work
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.120]   so I can be protected no matter the circumstance.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.720]   Because people who are ignorant
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   are usually spit up, chewed up,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   and spat out to die in a financial system
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.340]   that preys upon them.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.920]   One of the things I'm most hoping can happen
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.240]   from this newest course that I built
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.160]   is that you will take the information that you are learning
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.240]   and you will go and help that person
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.940]   who will never listen to me.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.060]   Most people will never listen to me,
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.700]   but you can go and you can help them.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.900]   And you can help them to be on the defense
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.500]   because here's the reality.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.180]   Most people bumble into credit card debt.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.660]   They don't have a clue what they're doing
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.260]   and they get eaten up and destroyed
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.020]   because they don't know how to defend themselves.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.580]   Please let that not be you.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.820]   Now let's answer some questions
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.860]   and here's some info for you.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.620]   We begin with a question from
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.780]   from Mario.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.860]   Mario writes in with a question.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.100]   I'm going to simplify, he gives a lot of data.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.860]   Hold with me, I'm gonna simplify the data
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.420]   for verbal audio math.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.980]   Mario's working with some clients who live in Florida
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.560]   and he's trying to help them.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.860]   They owe a total of $7,200 of credit card debt
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.020]   across three cards with 11 1/4% interest,
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.180]   24 1/4% interest, and 24 1/2% interest
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.660]   dividing with the different payments.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.580]   They're making minimum payments,
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.900]   but maybe just a little bit more.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.180]   They also owe $16,000 on a car
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:33.180]   where they owe more money on the car than it is worth.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.980]   They owe $16,000 on the car.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.420]   They're paying a 7 1/2% interest rate, $306 a month.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.900]   So they owe more money on the car than it is worth.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.820]   They also have a mortgage on their house of $144,000
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.620]   with a 3 1/4% interest rate
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.340]   and an equity loan on the house with a $60,000 balance
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.820]   and a 3 1/4% interest rate.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.140]   And they're earning about $6,000 per month.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.820]   The challenge is that their expenses
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.460]   are the same as their income,
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.680]   so it's difficult for them to pay down the credit.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.020]   And then Mario clarifies that this family owns,
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.800]   they own two cars.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.740]   One is paid off and of course the other has the debt
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.220]   and it's carrying extra debt,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.660]   an extra $2,000 from the car that is already paid off.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.820]   So his question is, are there any other credit cards
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.580]   or things that can help them to lower their interest
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.420]   so they can focus on paying faster
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.620]   and avoiding more interest on their credit cards
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.780]   while they're paying off their debt?
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.100]   So here is the answer for a household like this.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.540]   So for way of review, three credit cards,
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.740]   7,200 on the credit card, $16,000 of debt on the car
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.260]   and a mortgage and an equity loan as well.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.980]   Now the credit cards have the highest interest.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.180]   They are at 11 1/4% and almost 25% interest.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.020]   A total of about $4,500 of the debt is at 25% interest.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.380]   That is insane.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.940]   And then the car of course has 7 1/2% interest.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.860]   So here is what you need to do in a situation like this.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.860]   The problem is they're earning as much as they're spending
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.020]   and because their expenses are the same as their income,
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.980]   they're not making progress.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.480]   And that is a terrible place to be.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.940]   To feel like you're not making progress is brutal.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.620]   There's an old kind of self-help success quote
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.980]   that success is the progressive realization
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.320]   of a worthy goal or that's the progressive realization
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.220]   of a worthy ideal.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.540]   I think it's probably Orson Swett Marden
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.700]   or someone like that who initiated that.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.140]   And I think that there's a lot of value in that,
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.580]   that success, the feelings of success
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.100]   are largely based upon the fact
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.700]   that you know you're making progress
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.460]   in a positive direction.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.660]   And so it's fine to be in debt
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.300]   if you feel like you're making progress
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.420]   in a positive direction towards that freedom.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.140]   But if you're not making progress,
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.980]   it feels really brutal to be totally stuck.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.540]   It feels really miserable to not make progress.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.720]   So when you're in a situation like this and you're stuck,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.900]   you've got to say, what can I do to get unstuck?
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.740]   So what are some options?
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.440]   Well, you first need to analyze your income.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.580]   Is there something that can happen
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.180]   or is likely to happen with my income
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.980]   that will help me to be unstuck?
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.740]   Am I on track for a promotion?
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.220]   Am I on track for a bonus?
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.300]   Are we expecting some kind of windfall?
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.740]   Is there something that I can do
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.540]   to significantly increase my earnings?
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.540]   See, if you could just make a 20% change in earnings
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.000]   by working extra, taking an extra job.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.500]   So instead of $6,000 per month,
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.780]   you're earning $7,200 per month.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.620]   That's an extra $1,200 that is freed up
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.460]   towards these goals.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.620]   Now we only have $7,200 of credit card debt.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.060]   So if we could increase earnings
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.620]   and go from and put that full $1,200 towards the debt,
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.820]   in six months, we could have the credit card debt knocked out
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.140]   that would save a huge amount of money and interest
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.100]   to have that gone in six months.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.900]   And then at that point in time,
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.180]   you can continue on the car payment,
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.220]   probably have that knocked out in another six months.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.660]   So the first thing I would look at is to say,
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.700]   can I increase income?
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.300]   You have to increase income as much as possible.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.720]   So can I increase income?
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.300]   If you can increase income by working more hours
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.300]   at your current job, taking overtime, taking side work,
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.260]   figuring out how to some way to create more income
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.900]   that will help you get unstuck.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.500]   And as long as you have a timeline as in,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.740]   hey, we'll be unstuck out of this in six months,
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.060]   you can gut through and make progress.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.180]   Now, the second thing you can do is decrease expenses.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.500]   Reality is you don't have to spend $6,000 per month.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.700]   $6,000 per month is $72,000 per year,
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.980]   which is about $20,000 more,
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.500]   yeah, $20 to $25,000 more
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.420]   than the median household income.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.540]   So you could moderate in a few areas.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.620]   And some of the least painful moderation might be
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.620]   the cuts that don't result in big public changes.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.660]   You can cancel your TV.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.100]   You can change your grocery buying habits.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.140]   You can figure out how to save money.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.900]   You can temporarily cut some expenses
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.060]   without any big public changes.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.540]   If you could cut $1,000 off of your,
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.420]   well, let's just stick with the 20%.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.420]   If you could make a 20% decrease in your expenses
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.740]   and drop down to $4,800 a month,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.060]   which I'm so sure you could do.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.980]   If you could make a 20% decrease in expenses,
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.220]   we could all make a 20% decrease in expenses,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.140]   unless you're living on $400 a month.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.940]   You could all make a 20% decrease
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.740]   and drop you to $4,800 a month.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:08.100]   Then that will free up an extra $1,200 a month
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.260]   to pay towards debt.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.420]   Now, the cool thing is this.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.060]   Let's say you do both of those.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.900]   You've now freed up $2,400 per month.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.980]   You've increased your income by 20%
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.100]   and you've cut your expenses by 20%.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.420]   Well, now in that situation,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.060]   you've only got $7,200 of credit card debt.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.340]   If you can apply $2,400 of that,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.700]   then in three months, you're out of credit card debt.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.460]   And at $2,400 a month,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.460]   a $16,000 car loan is paid off in six and a half months.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.500]   So let's say it takes you three months
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.420]   to be out of credit card debt,
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.660]   and then it takes you an additional five months
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.100]   to have your car loan paid off.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.620]   Well, now eight months from now, today is October.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.260]   So by June of next year, you're out of debt,
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.780]   except for your house.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.940]   Now that's powerful.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.260]   All it requires is a 20% increase in income
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.280]   and a 20% decrease in expenses.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.020]   Now, perhaps in your situation,
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.060]   you can't do those relatively easy things
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.560]   of increasing your income or decreasing your expenses.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   Perhaps you are caring for your frail and elderly parents
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.760]   and two disabled children.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.560]   And most of your expenses are for medical equipment
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.280]   and medications for your frail and elderly parents
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.560]   and for your children.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.960]   And you can't afford to hire caregivers,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.840]   and so you can't afford to work more,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.040]   and your job is the only one that works for you.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.440]   So now you can't increase income or decrease expenses.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.200]   Well, what would you do then?
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.660]   The only solution here is to sell the car.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.160]   You have to sell the car.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.360]   Because the credit card payments
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.480]   are relatively negligible
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.800]   in terms of the total monthly amount.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.220]   The interest stinks,
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.820]   but the monthly amount is not all that much.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.000]   Usually the way that credit card payments work
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.580]   is you will pay 1% of the balance
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.520]   plus your current month's interest charges.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.280]   So assuming you're current on everything,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.220]   one of your cards has a $2,600 balance.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.120]   So we know that 1% of a $2,600 balance is going to be $26.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.440]   And then we got to figure out
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.160]   what the interest payment will be.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.080]   Well, we would do $2,600.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.080]   And on this one, the interest payment is 11.25%.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.440]   So that's $292 per year,
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.000]   but we would drop that into monthly,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.200]   divide it by 12, and that's $24.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.760]   And so the payment on that card
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.000]   is going to be 1% of the balance, $26,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.560]   plus $24 of interest in this month.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.800]   So that's going to be 50 bucks.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.120]   And then the other cards, again,
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.040]   let's do one of the cards that has a $3,800 balance.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.480]   So we know that 1% of the balance
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.800]   is going to be $38 for the principal balance.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.480]   And this card, let's do $3,800,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.520]   has a 20, let's call it 25% interest.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.040]   So 25% interest is $950 per year.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.160]   Divide that out to monthly, it's $79 in a month
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.220]   for this month's interest,
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.440]   if you're paying that much interest.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.480]   Now you add this all together and it's significant.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.080]   It's not insignificant,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.600]   but it's not the only thing.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.000]   So what do you do?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.920]   Well, you can work with the credit cards.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.800]   I would sell the car, because if you sell the car,
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.400]   you free up $300 a month.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.920]   And there's cars just about everywhere.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.760]   Now, you owe more money on the car than it's worth,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.440]   you have to borrow more money,
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.880]   but I would personally try to sell the car
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.980]   and live on one, one car.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:49.040]   Many families could get by with a little bit of thought,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.080]   a little bit of planning, many families could get by
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.620]   with one car and occasional Uber rides.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.640]   Uber and Lyft and et cetera,
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.840]   these services are so inexpensive now
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.340]   that really using them occasionally
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.560]   for a can't miss meeting or a morning
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.840]   when we've got to go in opposite directions
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.000]   is very reasonable.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.080]   And if you could free up with one decision to sell the car
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.160]   and you can free up that $306 a month,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.600]   that would be so valuable.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.360]   Because with one decision,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.480]   you can move massive amounts of money
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.440]   over to the credit card and getting rid of the credit card.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.160]   And you can always buy another car.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.480]   Now, what car would I not sell?
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.400]   The only reason I wouldn't sell a car
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.340]   is if that car were somehow very important to your family,
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.700]   as in it's the only minivan that you have
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.280]   and you have four children.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.200]   Or if you had done something like purchased that car new
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.680]   and it's well suited for you for the next 10 years.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.320]   It's not just some mediocre, normal car,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.040]   you bought it used, you could replace it very easily.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.480]   Rather, it was a brand new car, it was carefully selected,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.960]   it was a good deal when you bought it.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.720]   And if you just have it for a few more years,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.240]   it'll serve you for another 10 years.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.760]   If the car is uniquely valuable,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.440]   then okay, we'll work on another plan.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.760]   But I think a lot of times,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.720]   if you just sell the car and use the one car
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.760]   that you've got that's paid off
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.800]   and supplement it with an occasional Uber ride,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   my opinion, that's one of your easiest decisions to do,
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.480]   to free up your cashflow.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.740]   And then don't ever buy another car like that.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.880]   The thing about a car is, for you to own a $16,000 car,
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.380]   you need to be earning $160,000 per year.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.360]   So your car is already, I mean, it's not stupid,
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.720]   but that's the way I got there was with that 10% number.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.840]   Anyway, I would sell the car, but cars are easily replaced
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.040]   unless it were uniquely valuable,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.160]   you bought it new, et cetera.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   Okay, fine.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.520]   Now, to the credit cards,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.760]   what do you do with the credit cards?
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.840]   Well, depending on the credit score,
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.320]   you wanna start by applying
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.160]   for as many new credit cards as you can.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.580]   There is no reason for you
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.140]   not to make new credit card applications.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.520]   So you wanna apply for as many new credit cards as you can.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.880]   And you want to refinance this debt
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.700]   as much as you possibly can.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.600]   So the easiest credit cards to get
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.720]   are going to be credit cards
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.080]   that will offer you a 0% introductory period.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.600]   So you apply for a new 0% introductory credit card.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.020]   And then you move all of your household spending
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.080]   that is possible over onto that card.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.160]   And then you divert all of that excess income
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.560]   over onto your other credit card.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.620]   I don't care whether you go with the lowest balance
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.060]   or the highest interest rate,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.400]   just do whatever's gonna keep you focused and moving.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.680]   And your goal is to increase your available credit
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.080]   as much as possible
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.840]   so that you can refinance all of these cards.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.560]   Now, if you can do a balanced transfer card
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.360]   and you get approved for a balanced transfer card,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.160]   go ahead and move to that.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.320]   The key is to get your total available credit
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.600]   as high as you possibly can
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   and to keep your total debt owed as low as you possibly can.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.440]   And so there should be no reason.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.680]   As long as you've paid previous credit cards consistently,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.800]   there should be no reason
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.840]   to be paying interest rates of this high.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.520]   Now, here's the key.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.560]   I've just discussed four different ideas and strategies
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.680]   that can be applied.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.480]   Strategy number one was increase income 20%.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.320]   Strategy number two, decrease expenses 20%.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.200]   Strategy number three, sell the car.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.600]   Strategy number four,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.840]   focus on refinancing these credit cards
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.040]   to lower interest rates.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.600]   And let me add some math to credit card number four,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.080]   or strategy number four.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.200]   Total interest payments right here,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   $2,600 at 11.25% is $292 per year.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:01.400]   We've got a $3,850, let's do it, $3,800 debt at 24.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:07.000]   Let's call it 25% interest, $3,800 at 25% is $950 per year.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.880]   And we've got a debt of $737 at 25% interest,
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.240]   which is $184 per year.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   If we add 184 plus 950 plus 292,
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.720]   we wind up with total annual payments of $1,426.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.040]   That is the annual interest on these cards
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.360]   if they're not being paid down.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.320]   And currently, this person
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.040]   is just paying their minimum payments.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.800]   That means on a monthly basis,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.480]   we have $118 per month of interest on credit cards.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.720]   If we can make these changes,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.000]   you can move $118 off of the balance sheet,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.080]   sorry, off of the income cashflow statement,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.040]   off of the cashflow statement
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.000]   because of eliminating the credit card interest.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.880]   That saves $118, which can be put to principal repayment.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.840]   If you can do that through refinancing,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.640]   through 12-month and 18-month 0% offers,
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.400]   that will save a significant amount of money.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   That's $1,426 over the next 12 months
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.800]   that can be applied not towards credit card interest,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.560]   but towards lower amounts, sorry, lower balances.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.960]   If you can get rid of the car,
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.200]   that's $306 per month of payment that can be gotten rid of.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.560]   Now, if you can get to one car quickly,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.680]   and if you owe more on the car than it's worth,
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.720]   then you'll need to take out an additional credit card
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.520]   or a personal loan.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.360]   If you can't borrow more money on credit cards,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.920]   which you should be able to, especially if you're current,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.840]   but if you can't borrow more money on credit cards
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.480]   and you take out a personal loan of some kind with somebody
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.880]   to have enough money to pay off, to sell the car,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   pay off the difference and pay off the debt,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.760]   you can do that however you want.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.680]   But if you can get rid of that, that's $306 per month.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.440]   And then if you can make a 20% increase in your income,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.840]   that's $1,200 per month,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.240]   and a 20% decrease in your expenses,
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.360]   that's $1,200 per month.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.120]   Now, if you add all these together,
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.240]   we've got $1,200 times two, 2,400,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.880]   plus $300 per month, plus $120 per month.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.240]   That is now $2,820 per month of difference.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.360]   The power of getting out of debt
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.400]   is when you make a plan for $2,820 per month,
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.680]   instead of a plan of $50 per month,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.960]   by doing all four of those things simultaneously.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.920]   So fast forward, our total debt here was
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:47.320]   about $7,000 of credit card debt.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.480]   Well, if you can make over the next month or two,
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.600]   these changes, you can have the credit card debt paid off
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.960]   in two or three months.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.000]   You would have the car debt eliminated
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.920]   as quickly as you can sell the car,
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.880]   as quickly as you can save the money
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.680]   or borrow the money and sell the car.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.800]   So let's call it six months to have all this stuff done.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.680]   Now you've got $2,820 freed up.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.160]   That's again, the $118
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.960]   that you're not spending on credit card interest,
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.280]   the $306 a month
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.960]   that you're not spending on your car payment,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.360]   and the $2,400 a month
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.080]   that comes from a 20% increase in income
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.880]   and a 20% decrease in expenses.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.360]   And you turn around and you apply that
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.640]   to the $60,000 home equity loan.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.240]   And that is now paid off in
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   (keyboard clicking)
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   21 months.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.480]   Now at that point in time,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.360]   you are debt-free except the primary mortgage on your house,
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   which you're paying 3.25% on
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.400]   with $144,000 balance.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.800]   It's probably fine to keep that
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   and just to save money like crazy.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.600]   So now if you do all four of these things,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.720]   a couple of months from now, you're out of credit card debt.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.560]   A few months from now, you're out of credit card debt
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.480]   and car payment debt,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.280]   depending on the order that you approach it.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   Less than two years from now,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.760]   you have the home equity loan paid off.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.760]   And you have a rate of $2,800 per month of cash available,
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.200]   which if you start saving is $33,000 of cash in a year,
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.320]   which means one more year
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.000]   and you can go and buy the $30,000 car.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.560]   Now along the way, you'll probably get another car
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.960]   and you'll adjust these things a little bit.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.120]   But the point is, if you put these strategies together,
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.440]   that's where the power is.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.880]   And if you focus on aggressively
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.200]   putting these things into practice,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.360]   increasing income, decreasing expenses,
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.960]   aggressively paying down debt,
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.080]   making these big lifestyle moves,
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.160]   you'll save a lot of money, get out of debt pretty quickly.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.800]   Now another student of mine writes in and says,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.640]   "Joshua, I purchased and listened to the course first."
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.400]   Thank you, it's great information.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.920]   "I'd like to do the live call-in tomorrow,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.960]   "but I have to work."
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.120]   So here's my situation.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.400]   My credit score is about 608.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.160]   I have 99% on-time payment, 65% utilization,
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.200]   12 years length of credit.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.480]   I have a total of six credit cards
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.760]   with a total line of credit of $14,950,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   total debt of $9,979,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.440]   with an APR between 12.5% and 29.99%.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.560]   I have a plan to have the credit card debts paid off by July,
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   but I wanna confirm if I'm on the right path,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.080]   as well as ask questions regarding student loans,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.800]   both old and new.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.480]   I have older student loans
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.240]   that I had from my associate's degree completed in 2004.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.200]   I had to put it into deferment for 10 years
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.920]   due to a horrible financial situation
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.560]   with my now ex-husband.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.400]   We filed bankruptcy in 2009,
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.800]   and I have been rebuilding my credit ever since.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.880]   I began making payments on the student loan four years ago.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.680]   I have been working on finding a better job
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.720]   for the past year or so,
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.640]   and discovered that while my work experience
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.920]   is fairly extensive,
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.600]   prospective employers won't look at me
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.280]   without the bachelor's degree.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.480]   So this July, I finally made the decision
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.400]   to go back to school to get my degree,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.520]   business project management degree.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.560]   Since I'm now enrolled,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.280]   I put my existing loans and auto debits into deferment.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.440]   I'm taking advantage of this
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.760]   by using the funds that were allocated to those payments
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.520]   and putting them toward paying off my credit cards.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.600]   I'm on target to have the credit cards paid off by July.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.400]   The question, once that's done,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   what do you recommend regarding those new student loans
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.320]   that I'm amassing with my current school?
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.320]   $2,400 per quarter.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.840]   I estimate completing my degree by May of 2020,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.680]   and my existing old student loans,
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.960]   a scary amount of $38,000 at 7%.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.720]   I'm actively seeking a better paying job
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.800]   and not waiting until I finish my degree,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.280]   but I have my expenses reduced
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.120]   to be within my current income.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.560]   Per your course, I will also be applying
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.760]   for additional credit cards to improve my utilization ratio.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.680]   Thank you in advance for whatever guidance you can offer me.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.000]   Now, in this particular situation,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.800]   I don't see any major changes
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.160]   other than what is already done.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   Well, the first thing is,
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.480]   you have to cut those interest rates down.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.280]   You have to seek to refinance those credit cards
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.760]   actively and aggressively.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.080]   If you have credit card debt,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.600]   you should always be continually seeking to refinance them.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   And that's a constant, ongoing,
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.680]   incremental method of improvement.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.960]   If you focus on this every couple of months,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.360]   you apply for new cards,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.600]   every few months, you see what else you can do,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.080]   you can make incremental improvements,
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.320]   and incremental improvements matter.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.560]   For example, you currently owe about $10,000.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.200]   You may get approved for a new credit card
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.880]   of $1,000 this month.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   Well, move $1,000 over from 30% interest to 0% interest,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.800]   and then use that freed up cashflow
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.720]   to pay down the other balances.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.840]   And then as your credit score goes up,
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.160]   you then again, do it again.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.800]   So it's an ongoing process
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.760]   where you may do $1,000 this month,
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.040]   another two or three months from now,
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.240]   maybe another $4,000 you can get.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.040]   And to the point where six months from now,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.520]   you can have cut your total debt from $10,000 to $6,000,
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.640]   and that all that $6,000 is at 0%.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.880]   And that is a big savings when it gets to interest cost.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.960]   So 10%, sorry, $10,000 at,
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.680]   let's say an average of 22% interest here,
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.280]   is $2,200 per year, or $183 per month.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.560]   So the value is if you understand
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.000]   how the refinancing game works,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.860]   and if you can remove those interest payments,
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.480]   that's an extra $183 per month
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.300]   that you can apply towards paying off the credit card debt.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.900]   So what about the student loans?
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.080]   I wouldn't make any changes
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.560]   with the student loans at this point in time.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.480]   They're in deferment while you are in school.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.400]   And so I would keep them in deferment
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.720]   until you have the credit cards paid off.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.640]   What I would do is actively and diligently
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.960]   increase your total available credit,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.900]   and actively and diligently increase the amount of money
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.820]   that's available to you on credit cards,
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.840]   so that if, when you get out of school,
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.960]   and you get yourself into a position
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.840]   of where you're working consistently,
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.440]   and your income is high, et cetera,
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.720]   that if you want to refinance them
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.840]   from student loans onto credit cards then,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.740]   then you have that option.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.080]   I don't think this is a super high priority.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.560]   And the thing that you have to be careful here
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.320]   is the numbers are gonna be tough.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.960]   The ratio of the total amount of student loans
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.080]   as compared to your current borrowing ability is out of whack.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.200]   So you currently owe $38,000, and that's at 7% interest,
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.040]   and you're accumulating a new quarterly amount of debt,
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.080]   of $2,400, and if you're estimating
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.280]   completing your degree by May of 2020,
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.200]   let's call that with now in 2018, let's call that,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.040]   let's call it seven quarters.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.200]   So we're talking about $2,400 times seven
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.600]   of another $17,000 of student loan debt.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.200]   When you add that $17,000 on top of the $38,000
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.480]   that you already have, this is a significant amount
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   of student loan debt, that's $55,000.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.800]   So for you to be able to successfully
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.920]   and effectively refinance this debt,
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.200]   you would have to massively improve
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.840]   your available credit over onto credit cards.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.320]   And I would be very careful, and I would not,
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.680]   it seems very dangerous to me to try to do
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.320]   huge chunks of that, because if you were to get yourself
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.600]   in a mess, and you weren't able to float that debt
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.840]   using the 0% credit card game,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   you could have very problematic situations.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.680]   If you were to go from 0% to,
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.240]   and you're unable to refinance it 'cause you owe too much,
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.880]   onto 12, 15, or 30% debts,
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.800]   that would be very, very problematic.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   So what would I do?
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.640]   I would focus on keeping those student loans in deferment
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.800]   so that I can not pay those.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.040]   So I would keep those in deferment.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.200]   I would pay off the credit cards as quickly as I can
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.440]   under your current plan.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.360]   And then I would stop borrowing more money on student loans
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.800]   in order to minimize the total exposure to student loans.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.600]   And I would just pay cash for school expenses.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.840]   That's important to do to make sure
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.040]   that you're doing a good job
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.200]   of managing your actual expenses.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.320]   One of the big dangers of debt of any kind,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.640]   credit cards, student loans,
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   it can easily facilitate excessive borrowing.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.560]   Credit cards are the most dangerous
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.360]   with regard to excessive borrowing,
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.920]   but student loans are also dangerous
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.100]   because instead of bargaining with the school
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.200]   for a lower tuition payment,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.360]   instead of choosing a cheaper school,
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.400]   instead of moving from this college to the other college,
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.920]   'cause you can cut your costs down to $1,000 per quarter
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.060]   instead of $2,400 per quarter,
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.000]   there's a tendency to just to borrow more money
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.680]   on this idea that, well, in the future,
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.520]   I'll have more income because I'll have this degree.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.960]   Well, here's what's better.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.340]   So if it's good to have student loans
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.960]   and a higher income in the future, here's what's better,
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.680]   to have a higher income and no student loans.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.000]   Because then instead of spending the first few years
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.240]   after your degree,
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.880]   using all that excess money to pay for the schooling,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.760]   only then to finally get a little cash in your pocket,
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.040]   you can have no debt
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.760]   and have all that cash in your pocket.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.760]   So I would work on paying some cash down as time goes on.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.780]   The only distinction to that
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.320]   would be if you don't have any cash currently,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.720]   I would marshal cash.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.580]   Now, if you decide to refinance some of your debts
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.800]   over from student loans over to credit cards,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.200]   I would be very careful
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.580]   and I would only do that only in small chunks.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.520]   So maybe if you wind up owing $55,000,
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.820]   maybe you do this in chunks of $7,000 at a time.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.240]   So you refinance 7,000 bucks over to a credit card,
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.900]   use that 0% while you're accumulating the cash
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.840]   to pay it down.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.640]   Once that's paid off, you do it again.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.840]   The student loans are valuable because they are stable,
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.220]   they're at fixed interest rates,
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.120]   and you can put them back into deferment if you needed to.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.280]   If you faced a financial crisis,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.000]   you could put them back into deferment.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.740]   So the power is when you understand
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.420]   the risks of the credit card game
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.920]   and the risks of the student loans,
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.280]   and then you use them together.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.680]   And I would do it in chunks at that point in time.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.300]   Last question for today's Q&A call
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.280]   comes in from another student, Joshua, he writes in,
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.560]   "Joshua, I just purchased your credit card program
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.840]   "for my personal growth,
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.080]   "and I hope to help my small three-member staff
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.000]   "with the information too.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.880]   "Maybe we can change lives together.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.320]   "I'd like to call in tomorrow to discuss
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.540]   "how I use credit cards for my small business.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.120]   "We spend two to $4 million per year
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.360]   "on inventory through credit cards,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.400]   "and there have been some real ups and downs along the way.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.080]   "Twice we have had to close an account
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.360]   "and make a payment plan with a carrier.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.080]   "We currently are in a better place
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.860]   "and enjoy paying the card off several times a month.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.900]   "I hope to hear your thoughts on some good practices
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.640]   "for a small company to maintain the growth of inventory
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.540]   "by spending while not burying ourselves in debt."
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.320]   Thank you.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   This situation is one that some people have access to,
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.780]   and it's a powerful opportunity for you to consider.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:53.360]   So number one, you must, must make sure
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.560]   that you never, ever again in your life
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.560]   are ever even a moment late paying your monthly payment.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.800]   You must never have a day when you're a moment late
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.700]   paying your monthly payment.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.120]   So use the instructions in the course
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.520]   to establish the infrastructure
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.920]   that makes sure that you're never late,
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   because you must have the best possible credit score.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.000]   You have, with this much spending, legitimate spending,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.280]   you have huge options to use credit cards
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   in a powerful way for your own benefits.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.680]   But you've got to make sure you don't screw it up
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:42.400]   by messing up your credit score.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.140]   Now, here is what's cool.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:50.240]   There are very few untaxed fringe benefits available
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.440]   in today's world.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:57.040]   But one of the best ones is credit card points.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.820]   And in your case, you should use what I have taught you,
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.200]   what I have to teach you,
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.880]   but you should also go out and make sure
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.860]   that you become an absolute expert at the points game.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.700]   And by points, I mean, the practice of applying for,
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.260]   applying for credit cards in order to take advantage
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.120]   of mileage bonuses and mileage offers.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.960]   Where when you go and you take out the new credit card
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.820]   and they give you 40,000 miles,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.560]   if you have, you know, a few thousand dollars of spending
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.760]   on the card within a certain period.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.660]   The biggest problem that people face in that world
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.900]   is figuring out how to get enough spending
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.100]   on their credit card in order to make
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.220]   those minimum payments.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.060]   Sorry, in order to make those minimum spend requirements.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.700]   Because many people struggle, if they require,
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.060]   they apply for a new card that gives them
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.060]   50,000 airline miles.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.300]   And they apply for a new card and they have to spend
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.260]   $6,000 within the first two months.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.940]   Many people struggle to do that.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.020]   There are, in my opinion, two basic reasons
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.600]   why people struggle to get the spending necessary first.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.800]   If you're committed to frugality,
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   then minimizing expenses is gonna be a better move for you
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.760]   than getting bonus points.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.600]   Just if you're just talking about household spending.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.560]   You know, many families could cut their expenses
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.440]   significantly by a couple thousand bucks per month
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.720]   if they wanted to, to save money and build wealth.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.560]   But then that makes you feel like,
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.800]   well, I'm not maximizing the bonus points.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.340]   So first, is frugality is always your first step.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.900]   The second thing is it's hard for many families
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.020]   to get the payments onto a credit card
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.260]   for their big expenses.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.980]   It's one thing to put your groceries and gas
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.180]   on a credit card, but come on, groceries and gas
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.780]   is a thousand bucks, 1,500 bucks for many families.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.180]   Meanwhile, the big expenses, as in mortgage payments
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.940]   and car payments, those are hard to get
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.820]   onto a credit card.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.220]   It's possible sometimes, but hard to do.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.820]   And if you do, you wind up paying extra fees
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.580]   through using some of the intermediaries
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.780]   which will take a credit card payment
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.940]   and send out the money.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.880]   So it's hard to get those expenses there.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.260]   But if you've got two to $4 million per year
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.460]   and your vendors will take credit cards
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.940]   for that inventory, and you can do that,
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.700]   I mean, this is a golden opportunity.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:21.380]   You should be accumulating millions of miles per year
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.660]   and huge numbers of cell phone points
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.860]   because, sorry, hotel points, which are the easiest to get.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.380]   Yes, you can consider the cash back, et cetera,
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.540]   but you should be accumulating miles and hotel points.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.700]   Now, what's cool about miles and hotel points
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.500]   is the benefit of them is not taxed to you.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.020]   And this applies if you are an employee
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.220]   and you're working for a company
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.920]   and you're getting airline miles and hotel points,
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.500]   even though it's your business's card.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.620]   And if you own the business yourself, this is wonderful
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.860]   because you can take deductions on the debt
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.380]   if you had to even, even if you owed interest
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.420]   and you took your business interest deduction.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.100]   But even if not, you're still being able to deduct
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.860]   all the cost of the inventory as your cost of goods sold.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.680]   And then you get these extra tax-free fringe benefits.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.700]   There is no reason, if you have this kind of business,
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.060]   there is no reason that you and your family
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:19.060]   should not be taking multiple exotic vacations per year
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.780]   with first-class airfare around the world,
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.820]   first-class five-star hotel stays.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.860]   You should also be doing this for your staff.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.780]   With two to $4 million of spending,
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.200]   you have plenty of available spending
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.460]   to accumulate huge amounts of airline miles
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.020]   and hotel stays for them
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.700]   that you can transfer to their account so that they can go
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.100]   and take advantage of these stays
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.680]   so that they can go on exotic vacations
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.420]   as part of the fringe benefit of working there.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.100]   That's wonderful because it doesn't cost you a dime
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.220]   out of your pocket.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.280]   It's not taxable income to them.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.540]   And it's a very valuable fringe benefit
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.780]   that they and their families will really enjoy
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.820]   and it'll increase your employee loyalty.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:09.780]   And then, you know, if you still have more left over
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.900]   after you've taken care of your employees
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.420]   and your own family,
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.100]   you can use these for your own goodwill
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.520]   within your extended family.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.020]   You can use these airline miles for others.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.220]   I would probably be cautious.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.260]   You could sell them to family members at a discounted rate,
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.860]   but what I would probably do is just keep it all
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.980]   with non-financial transactions.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.100]   Gift the miles to their accounts,
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.460]   let them book tickets using your frequent flyer accounts
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.820]   for their family vacations and hotel stays,
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.620]   gift them to them, but I would not,
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.060]   and then let them, you know,
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.460]   reimburse you in some other way
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.840]   that's not a financial transaction.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.500]   Let it just be a gift and get your benefit in other ways.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.320]   You have a golden opportunity here.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.860]   When you can put millions of dollars per year
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.300]   of spending onto credit cards,
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.000]   you owe it to yourself, your family, your staff,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.640]   to become a master of the mileage game
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.600]   and of the hotel stays game.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.380]   There are plenty of good teachers who will help you.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.740]   There are plenty of good courses and membership sites
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.240]   where they get you the best deals,
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.280]   get on Flyertalk, get on all the forums,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.900]   make sure that you know what you're doing,
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.100]   because the fact that you have a business
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.940]   where you can buy inventory and such with this is,
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.740]   well, it's truly wonderful.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.580]   So I think you've got a huge opportunity.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.860]   Just make sure that you keep your credit score high,
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.100]   make sure that you think about what you're doing,
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.360]   make sure that you manage the business,
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.060]   that you're not spending excess money,
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:39.020]   not buying excess inventory, but look forward,
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.080]   one of the fringe benefits of your business,
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   look forward to many years of first-class airfare
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.380]   and exotic hotel stays,
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.500]   thanks to your vendor's willingness
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.940]   to accept credit cards for payments instead of checks.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.460]   Now, I guess the last point I think would be appropriate.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.820]   Always see if you can negotiate a cash discount.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:06.100]   I think that it's well within many vendors' interest
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.340]   to negotiate a cash discount,
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.760]   because they're paying the processing fees.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.940]   So don't forget about also minimizing your leverage.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.460]   If you can cut, let's say, half a million dollars
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.820]   of your inventory costs go and are paid in cash
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.340]   instead of with credit cards,
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.700]   and that lowers your expenses by five,
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.820]   you can negotiate a 5% cash discount
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.780]   on that half a million bucks, that's $25,000.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:36.660]   So if that $25,000 should basically be pure profit,
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.660]   'cause we're saving a pure expense,
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.500]   that $25,000 should put some extra profit in your pocket
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.620]   and then make up the miles
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.480]   with the other million and a half of spending,
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.420]   make up the hotel stays
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.060]   with the other million and a half of spending.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.420]   So don't forget about the nuts and bolts
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.260]   of always making sure
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.700]   that you're spending the lowest amount of money,
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.540]   paying the lowest cost, et cetera,
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.460]   even though you are getting those benefits.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.380]   I don't think even as valuable as the airline miles
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.140]   and the hotel game can be,
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.180]   you still don't wanna pay very much for it.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.220]   And I think if you can negotiate cash discounts,
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.100]   that'll always be a better move.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.740]   And it's good for you to practice doing that.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.600]   So go for it and I hope that the course serves you.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.680]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.200]   I hope that you've enjoyed this Q&A.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.920]   If you haven't purchased the credit card course yet,
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.080]   I'd encourage you to do it.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.360]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.760]   39 bucks is the cost.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.720]   Again, radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.440]   You will save potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.040]   and also set yourself up very, very well.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.760]   And credit cards, if you know this stuff,
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.040]   let me give you one more example,
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.940]   actually two more comments that I need to add.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.300]   Forgive me, I didn't have these on my outline.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   One, last week I neglect or in a previous Q&A,
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.860]   I took a question from a listener
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.340]   who was talking about closing credit cards
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.180]   to avoid annual fees.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.460]   And I had a couple of listeners that wrote in
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.260]   with some suggestions on that.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:04.060]   So if you have a credit card with a company,
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.100]   and especially this happens
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.620]   if you're playing the mileage game,
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.820]   you've applied for a Premier card
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.000]   and they'll waive the annual fee for the first year
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.280]   and give you a 30, 40, 50, $60,000 mileage bonus
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.240]   for taking out the card.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   But then the next year you're looking at a $300 annual fee.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.120]   If you close that card,
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.920]   the problem is you'll lose that available credit.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.040]   That lowers your overall credit,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.720]   that increases your utilization ratio,
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.160]   that'll lower your credit score,
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.720]   that'll shorten up the length of your credit history.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.400]   So if you keep that card open, it'll improve everything.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.800]   There's no reason to close it
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.900]   except for that $300 annual fee.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.060]   Well, many, what listeners told me,
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.220]   and I didn't even think to cover it,
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.440]   but if you call a credit card company,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.360]   you can often call them and either A,
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.440]   they may give you another promo year on the fee,
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.180]   or they'll downgrade you
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.940]   to another one of their credit cards
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.680]   that doesn't have an annual fee.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.080]   So you keep the account open, you keep the history going,
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.020]   you keep the positive reporting of all those things
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   to the credit bureaus,
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:11.800]   but you are able to do so without paying that annual fee.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   So if you have annual fees, check on that.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.680]   Now, here's what's cool about having excess
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.320]   or larger amounts of debt.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.200]   One of the questions that I received
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.600]   from a student in the course,
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.320]   they had a rental property
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.440]   and they had a partner in the rental property
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.440]   and their partner wanted to cash out of the rental property.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.400]   And so this particular student
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.440]   had in excess of six figures of available credit,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.380]   they were gonna put about $75,000 of debt
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.940]   onto the credit card
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.860]   so that they could cash out their partner from the property.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:48.860]   Now, that is an example of a good use of credit cards,
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.380]   because as long as you have other cash
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.100]   and a significant credit score
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.500]   and a significant available credit,
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.140]   so you don't run the risk of the credit cards
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.020]   cutting you off, lowering your credit limits,
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.860]   I gave them some specific advice
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.360]   of how to minimize those risks, they're substantial,
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.240]   but you can do things like using an unsecured debt
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.620]   like a credit card to cash out a partner out of a property,
