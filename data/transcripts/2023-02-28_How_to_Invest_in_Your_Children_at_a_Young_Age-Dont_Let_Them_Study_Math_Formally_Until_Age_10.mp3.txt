[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.520]   The audio you are about to hear is an appendix
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.600]   from the book, "Teaching the Trivium,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.800]   Christian Homeschooling in a Classical Style."
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.260]   It's article 11 in the appendix,
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.280]   entitled "History and Research on the Teaching of Math."
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   This is one of the more well-researched articles
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.520]   I've ever found on this subject.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.720]   And the authors of this book have brought together
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.320]   their sources and their research here
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.220]   and formed the opinion that formalized
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.020]   workbook-based instruction in mathematics
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.600]   should not begin for children until about the age of 10.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.360]   While I myself do not strictly follow this practice,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.140]   it is something that I think should be widely debated
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.700]   and should be widely discussed and understood.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.380]   Because while we are working hard
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.140]   to develop our children's brains
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.480]   by catalyzing a very high level of numeracy in them,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.220]   it's important that we do that at the proper time.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.220]   And mathematics is something that I'm not sure
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.100]   that it should be learned early for most people.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.400]   As parents, we need to exercise a great deal of discretion
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700]   and good judgment as to what is working well
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.300]   with our children and what is not working well
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.540]   with our children, that's the goal.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.980]   And if your child is not succeeding with math
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.580]   at the age of five, then you should supplement something
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.260]   that will be better for this child's age of study
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.620]   and simply push off the study of math
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.100]   to a time when the child's brain
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.500]   is more prepared to accept it.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.100]   But in today's world, where we understand
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.940]   the importance of mathematics and science
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.740]   and technology, et cetera, to our generalized culture
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.580]   and success in academia, parents often feel
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.900]   this intense pressure to make sure
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.540]   that a child is succeeding at a very young age.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.760]   And I fear that that can many times cause us
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.340]   to pressure our children in a wrong way,
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.980]   a counterproductive way, a way that destroys
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.300]   their confidence and their ability
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.940]   to be excellent at mathematics.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.100]   And it would be helpful and useful
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.140]   if we had a little bit of context to inform our opinions.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.540]   And so while my wife and I in our homeschool
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.660]   have indeed been using some workbooks
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.060]   and doing some workbook math prior to the age of 10,
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.420]   I am very confident that it would be perfectly okay
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.140]   to delay until the age of 10.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.260]   And I have suggested this to people
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.220]   when a child is struggling.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.780]   And I think it's one of those areas
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.260]   that I wanna reinforce you in
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.980]   so that you can exercise good judgment.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.340]   This appendix is full of historical quotes
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.300]   and especially in the beginning,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   it's just a little bit slow.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.580]   So if you don't wish to follow all of the historical quotes,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.980]   I'm going to read them for the sake of completeness.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.140]   But if you don't wish to listen to all of the quotes
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.100]   from their research and sources,
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.340]   just skip forward, say 15, 20 minutes.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.060]   And at the end of this article,
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.540]   I will again sum up some of the reasons why I think
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.220]   in many cases people should wait until the age of 10.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.300]   One more comment, in the previous episode of the podcast
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.140]   called "How to Catalyze a High Level of Numeracy
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.580]   in Your Children," I mentioned the stories
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.820]   of Art Robinson and his family,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.220]   as well as citing this particular author
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.220]   and their experience.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.220]   And in short, waiting until age 10 to do workbook math
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.300]   does not mean that you wait until age 10 to do math.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.460]   There are lots and lots of things
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.700]   that you can teach your child, mathematical concepts,
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.580]   numbers, counting, telling time,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.300]   all of the that you can use in daily life
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.620]   when you're cooking with your child
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.300]   or playing with your child, et cetera,
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.740]   so that your child will have a strong,
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.580]   generalized understanding of mathematics.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.820]   And in addition to that, if you will work diligently
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.220]   at teaching your child math facts,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.940]   all of his addition, subtraction, multiplication,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.180]   and division tables, then your child will be
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.340]   very well prepared to succeed in mathematics.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.820]   And what Harvey and Laurie Bludhorn,
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.420]   the authors of this book called "Teaching the Trivium,
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.060]   Christian Homeschooling in a Classical Style,"
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.420]   say with their children, I think they had five children,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.640]   and what Art Robinson's experience has been
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.060]   with his six children and with the many acolytes of his
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.800]   who have used his course of study and methodology,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.700]   is that children are very able to come in
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.180]   and basically just start with fifth grade math and succeed.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.060]   And if indeed any makeup work is necessary,
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.980]   at that point in time, you can cover in just a few weeks
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.540]   what previously you may have spent years wrestling over.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.060]   And if you have to tie your child to a chair
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.800]   and move his hand for him to get him to do his math,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.980]   it's a pretty good sign that maybe workbook math
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.740]   is not what he should be focusing on right now,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.980]   and you can put that time to other productive use.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.860]   So without further ado, let's begin the article
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.580]   with the actual formal research on this topic.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.500]   "History and Research on the Teaching of Math"
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.980]   by Harvey and Lori Bludhorn.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.380]   Formal arithmetic at age 10, hurried or delayed?
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.180]   Provincialism is the word which we use
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.140]   to describe an opinion which is narrow
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.500]   and self-centered in perspective.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.940]   Because the common practice in our culture in our day
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.460]   is to begin formal instruction in arithmetic
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.900]   as early as age four or five,
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.660]   many have questioned the suggestion
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.220]   that one may wait until age 10
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.620]   before beginning formal instruction in arithmetic.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.100]   Waiting until age 10 for formal instruction in arithmetic
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.060]   is often misnomered "late start" or "delayed academics."
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.240]   A broader perspective would examine more
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.860]   than what is simply the prevailing practice
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.300]   of a particular culture at a particular time,
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.660]   especially if that practice is a policy
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.320]   largely imposed by the government.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.240]   We don't claim to have the last word on the subject,
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.660]   but we have examined the matter more broadly.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.780]   And in this article, we will present some of the things
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.340]   which we have discovered.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.380]   We will quote only a small selection
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.380]   from authorities we have found,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.980]   and we will allow you to form your own opinion
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.620]   before we comment.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.220]   The historical perspective, what the ancients did.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.700]   Quote, "Strange though it may seem at first,
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.940]   it is nevertheless quite clear that addition,
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.540]   subtraction, multiplication, and division,
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.120]   comparatively simple operations,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.460]   which we inflict on our children
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.260]   while they are still quite young, were in antiquity
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.500]   far beyond the horizon of any primary school.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.680]   The widespread use of calculating tables
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.760]   and counting machines," abacus,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.920]   "shows that not many people could add up.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.360]   And this goes on being true to a much later date,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   even in educated circles."
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.120]   That quote is from "A History of Education in Antiquity"
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   by Henry Maru, published 1956.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.980]   What the medievals and later did.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.380]   These are various quotes from several different pages.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.940]   Quote, "Before the Reformation,
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.700]   there was little or nothing accomplished
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.740]   in the way of public education in England.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.180]   In the monastery, some instruction was given by monks,
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.400]   but we have no evidence that any branch of mathematics
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.880]   was taught to the youth.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.860]   Some idea of the state of arithmetical knowledge
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.300]   may be gathered from an ancient custom at Shrewsbury,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.300]   where a person was deemed of age
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.900]   when he knew how to count up to 12 pence."
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.700]   See, Tyler's "Primitive Culture," published 1889.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.820]   "In the 16th century,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.460]   on the suppression of the monasteries,
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.860]   schools were founded in considerable numbers,
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.460]   and for centuries have served for the education of the sons,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.260]   mainly of the nobility and gentry.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.340]   In these schools, the ancient classics
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.620]   were the almost exclusive subjects of study.
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.100]   Mathematical teaching was unknown there.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.820]   Perhaps the demands of everyday life
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.700]   forced upon the boy is a knowledge of counting
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.980]   and of the very simplest computations.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.980]   But we are safe in saying that,
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.200]   before the close of the last century,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.980]   the ordinary boy of England's famous public schools
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.440]   could not divide 2,021 by 43,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.180]   though such problems had been performed centuries before,
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.220]   according to the teaching of Brahmagupta and Bhaskara,
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.740]   by boys brought up on the far off banks of the Ganges."
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.220]   By the way, just to insert,
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.740]   always remember that when you hear the term public schools
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.820]   in the context of England,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.020]   that means what I use the term private schools to mean.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.680]   And when you hear private schools
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.360]   in the context of the country of England,
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.020]   that means government schools.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.580]   So one of the reasons why, when I refer to schooling,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.460]   I use the term government school and private school,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.220]   because it helps to solve this international issue
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.020]   with the English language.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.380]   "All the information we could find
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.260]   respecting the education of the upper classes
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.780]   points to the conclusion that arithmetic was neglected,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.020]   and that De Morgan was right in his statement
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.500]   that as late as the 18th century,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.800]   there could have been no such thing
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.900]   as a teacher of arithmetic in schools like Eton.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   In 1750, Warren Hastings,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.620]   who had been attending Westminster,
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.320]   was put into a commercial school
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.020]   that he might study arithmetic and bookkeeping
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.500]   before sailing for Bengal.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.020]   At the universities, little was done in mathematics
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.980]   before the middle of the 17th century.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.560]   During the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.420]   fresh statutes were given,
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.600]   excluding all mathematics from the course of undergraduates,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.660]   presumably because this study pertained to practical life
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.900]   and could, therefore, have no claim
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.120]   to attention in a university.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.180]   This scorn and ignorance of the art of computation
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.820]   by all but commercial classes
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.900]   is seen in Germany as well as England.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.060]   It was not before the present century
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.000]   that arithmetic and other branches of mathematics
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.820]   found admission into England's public schools.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.260]   At Harrow, vulgar fractions, Euclid and geography
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260]   and modern history were first studied in 1829.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260]   At the Merchant-Taylor School,
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.780]   mathematics, writing and arithmetic were added in 1829.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.780]   At Eton, mathematics was not compulsory till 1851.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.820]   Since the art of calculation was no more considered
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.660]   a part of a liberal education
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.140]   than was the art of shoemaking,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.020]   it is natural to find the study of arithmetic
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.380]   relegated to the commercial schools.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.380]   The poor boy sometimes studied it,
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.460]   the rich boy did not need it.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.320]   In the Latin schools, it was unknown,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.420]   but in schools for the poor, it was sometimes taught.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.580]   The first arithmetics used in the American colonies
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.980]   were English works.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.460]   The earliest arithmetic written and printed in America
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.280]   appeared anonymously in Boston in 1729.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.160]   Though a work of considerable merit,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.240]   it seems to have been used very little.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.640]   In 1788, appeared at Newburyport,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   the New and Complete System of Arithmetic by Nicholas Pike.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.760]   It was intended for advanced schools.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.680]   Reform in arithmetical teaching
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.120]   in the United States did not begin
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.800]   until the publication of Warren Colburn in 1829,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.520]   1821, excuse me, of the intellectual arithmetic.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.480]   This was the first fruit of Pestalozian ideas
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.000]   on American soil.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.320]   The success of this little book was extraordinary,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.400]   but American teachers in Colburn's time
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.480]   and long after never quite succeeded
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.240]   in successfully in grafting Pestalozian principles
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.480]   on written arithmetic.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.600]   Those quotes all from a history of elementary mathematics
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.920]   with hints on methods of teaching
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.460]   by Florian Cajori, PhD, published 1917.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.720]   The American, quote, "The American Calculator,"
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.960]   first published in 1828,
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.480]   "is reasonably typical of the colonial period.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.440]   "The text was used with older students,

[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.800]   taken from the text of an address
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.860]   delivered by Warren Colburn
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.400]   before the American Institute of Instruction in Boston, 1830.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.660]   "In the early 17th century,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.720]   "the grammar school curriculum
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.180]   "was almost certainly confined to Latin grammar,
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.320]   "the catechism, and Bible study.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.580]   "Pupils arriving at Oxford and Cambridge
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.720]   "frequently did not have any knowledge of Arabic numerals,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.060]   "to say nothing of the elementary arithmetical operations."
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.800]   From "A History of Mathematics Education in England,"
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.760]   by Geoffrey Howson, published 1981.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.900]   So, when it changed, quote, "Pestalozzi,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.360]   "it is to the latter," 1803,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.140]   "that we owe the greatest impetus
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.360]   "in the rational teaching of arithmetic to young children.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.340]   "The essential features of his reform are as follows.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.400]   "One, he taught arithmetic to children
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.560]   "as soon as they entered school,

[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.640]   "using objects before the figures were taught.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.540]   "Three, he approached the subject of fractions
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.880]   "in the same way.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.000]   "Four, he made arithmetic the most prominent subject
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.960]   "in the school, and it is to his influence
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.340]   "that its present prominence is due.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.420]   "Five, he emphasized oral arithmetic,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.440]   "a movement that led to the great success
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.120]   "of Warren Colburn in the United States.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.860]   "Tuerck," 1816, "did not wish arithmetic

[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.840]   "nor before the child reached the age of 10 years.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.040]   "And of this idea, there is just at present
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.460]   "a temporary revival as if it were a new discovery,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.800]   "although it was practically universal before Pestalozzi."
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.640]   That is a quote that's quoting
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.280]   from "Acyclopedia of Education,"
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.640]   edited by Paul Monroe, published 1919.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.240]   Summary of the historical evidence.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.880]   "The material which we have read indicates
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.160]   "that the formally teaching of arithmetic
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.180]   "to young children was not practiced by the ancients,
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.900]   "the medievals, nor up to modern times.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.320]   "In fact, it was common to withhold
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.860]   "formal instruction in arithmetic
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.660]   "until somewhere between the ages of 15 and 18.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.100]   "It was not until the 16th century
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.760]   "that arithmetic began to be taught to children
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.780]   "as young as age 12 or even 10.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.660]   "It was Pestalozzi at the beginning of the 19th century
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.300]   "who began to teach arithmetic to children
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.040]   "as young as age six or seven,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.100]   "though the practice of waiting until age 10
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.180]   "persisted well into the 20th century."
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.340]   So to wait until age 10 to teach arithmetic
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.680]   is actually from a historical perspective
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.900]   to advocate an early start.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.280]   It is only from a decidedly modern perspective,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.060]   a provincial perspective,
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.320]   that waiting until age 10 would appear to be a late start.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.180]   We have not discovered any material
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.260]   which might indicate the contrary.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.000]   The research perspective.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.240]   The research is quoted here
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.460]   to demonstrate the point at hand.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.900]   We recognize that studies are open
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.300]   to various interpretations.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.700]   Inefficient period.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.180]   Quote, "Early childhood may simply be an inefficient period
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.840]   "in which to try to teach skills
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.560]   "that can be relatively quickly learned in adolescence."
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.140]   This comes from "Prime Time for Education,
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.020]   "Early Childhood or Adolescence" by William Rower
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.420]   in the Harvard Educational Review published 1971.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.260]   I'm gonna interrupt here my reading of this appendix
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.800]   to comment on this.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.860]   In addition, and forgive me,
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.980]   I'm repeating a tiny bit of what I said yesterday,
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.060]   but I came to thinking about some of these topics
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.020]   quite a lot when I started thinking
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.780]   about the efficiency of learning at different ages.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.780]   And if we know that we need to learn something,
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.740]   for example, we need to teach our children arithmetic
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.380]   and help them to be excellent in mathematics,
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.180]   we know that that needs to be done.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.660]   We need to think about by what age that needs to be done.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.540]   So let's say we say it needs to be done by age 18.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.900]   The question is, we have a limited number of hours
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.780]   that we can use for formal instruction.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.500]   How are we best to use those hours?
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.220]   Commonly, if you do the math
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.260]   on the amount of time children spend in school,
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.340]   it's usually something like 15,000 hours,
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.820]   15 to 18,000 hours, depending on how we do the math,
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.260]   that an American child in the American system
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.700]   will spend in school.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.780]   So if we have 15,000 hours,
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.620]   how should we dedicate those hours?
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.180]   Well, imagine for a moment
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.500]   that we could successfully teach mathematics
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.500]   in say 3,000 hours by waiting to start until say 10 or 11.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.580]   But if we start before that,
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.580]   we use say 1,000 or 2,000 hours more than is necessary.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.100]   And I'm just making these numbers up.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.820]   I have no basis in evidence or even calculation in them,
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.380]   just to drive the example.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.780]   Well, now that's 2,000 hours
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.780]   that we can't dedicate to other things.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.340]   And as I'll talk about,
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.220]   or I think they mentioned it in a moment in this appendix,
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.980]   those early years are really beautifully suited
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.420]   to other things.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.460]   I myself became convinced that language acquisition
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.060]   is what a five-year-old brain is wired to do.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.580]   So is a seven-year-old brain
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.300]   and a nine-year-old brain, et cetera.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.220]   And so what if instead of teaching mathematics
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.220]   from the age of five to the age of 10,
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.100]   we could do it much more efficiently
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.780]   by starting at the age of 10.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.380]   And instead we could teach a second or a third
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.180]   or a second, third, fourth, and fifth language
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.500]   in those same 2,000 hours.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.380]   Unless you think I'm being excessive,
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.660]   I think those numbers are just about right.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.700]   If we assume a 180-day school year
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.660]   and we take 180 days out over five years,
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.020]   we wind up with basically 900 hours.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.740]   Well, to learn Spanish or French
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.940]   for a native English speaker adult learner
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.940]   is a 675-hour project.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.220]   I would say that with more efficient methods
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.260]   and with childhood and just a few extra hours
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.100]   in here and there,
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.180]   the hours that the child might be spending doing homework
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.020]   and other work, that it should be no problem
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.780]   for a 10-year-old to have his native language
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.860]   as well as two foreign languages
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.860]   and then start math at age 10.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.460]   And since we have abundant evidence
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.620]   that this can be done more efficiently at that age,
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.340]   and let's say the 10-year-old is completely caught up
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.260]   with his peers by the age of 11, probably faster,
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.540]   but would you rather have an 11-year-old
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.420]   who's caught up with his peers and speaks one language
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.740]   or would you rather have an 11-year-old
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.260]   who is current with his peers and speaks three languages?
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.940]   What's gonna be in the better interest of the child?
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.580]   So that's what that quote by Rohwer
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.740]   published in the Harvard Educational Review is so important.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.780]   He said, "Early childhood may simply be
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.540]   "an inefficient period in which to try to teach skills
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.800]   "that can be relatively quickly learned in adolescence."
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.620]   Children don't do better in math,
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.620]   but they do learn to hate school.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.420]   Quote, "In a cross-national study
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.220]   "of mathematics achievement, Hewson, 1967,

[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.240]   "that the longer the student was enrolled prior to testing,

[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.700]   Of course, it might be argued that these results
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.060]   do not confront the issue directly,
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.180]   since the argument in favor of earlier school entry
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.780]   is most persuasive for low-income children.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.320]   The Hewson, 1967 report, however,
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.600]   speaks directly to this point as well.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.280]   "For all of the students tested,
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.600]   "information was obtained to permit a categorization

[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.320]   published in 1952.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.360]   By the way, inserting one of Joshua's comments here,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.520]   there are a couple of components,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.280]   and let me add a little bit of context
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.800]   to help those of you who haven't studied this.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.400]   Number one, there is a strong movement
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   among many schooling experts
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.240]   to introduce arithmetic using lots of tangible items,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   using lots of physical, manipulative items, et cetera.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.880]   And I think that that emphasis
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.840]   that many alternative educational models have
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.080]   and have discovered is along this line,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.320]   that just expecting a young child
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   to do formalized, book-based arithmetic
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.460]   is probably not the best expectation.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.080]   So using manipulatives, et cetera,
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.240]   can help with those concepts.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.800]   Separately, there is a strong background
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.400]   of arithmetic being taught in a social way.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.640]   I have a complete set
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.960]   of the classic American educational texts
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.080]   called Ray's Arithmetic.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.000]   McGuffey readers and Ray's Arithmetic
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.960]   were very widely used in American school systems
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.040]   one to two centuries ago.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.560]   And a huge portion of that was done
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.420]   as oral participation from the whole class.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.500]   And then finally, I think this is good reason
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.100]   to consider a narrative approach.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.720]   And so I mentioned in the previous episode
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.120]   that I'm a big fan of the Life of Fred books.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.140]   My children enjoy them, et cetera.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.540]   So I think that if you wish to avoid
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.460]   formal workbook-based math,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.780]   there's abundant evidence that using manipulatives,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.080]   teaching arithmetic informally,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.140]   drilling and memorizing math tables,
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.940]   especially in a social setting,
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.020]   doing it at the breakfast table
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.700]   with all your children, et cetera,
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.860]   teaching, learning even formulas and things
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.220]   that are verbal that'll be used later,
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.380]   and then doing something like reading aloud
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.020]   from Life of Fred or allowing your children
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.380]   to read Life of Fred without too much
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.620]   hardcore pencil-on-paper calculations
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.620]   is an abundantly effective math curriculum.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.940]   And then when they are ready, developmentally ready,
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.940]   then introducing the workbooks is appropriate.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.700]   Drive them to abstraction.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.220]   Quote, "Harris has pointed out
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.980]   that in the first stages of the development of the mind,
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.740]   the mathematical process is decidedly more complex
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.420]   than the other mental processes
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.300]   which are taking place at that time."
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.580]   Quoting, "The reason why it requires
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.460]   a higher activity of thought to think quantity,"
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.780]   which is an abstract number,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.580]   "and understand mathematics than it does
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.180]   to perceive quality or things and environments,"
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.580]   which are physical objects,
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.180]   "lies right in this point.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.500]   The thought of quantity is a double thought.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.900]   It first thinks quality, object,
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.340]   and then negates it or thinks it away."
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.460]   In other words, it abstracts from quality.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.900]   It first thinks thing and environment, quality,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.740]   and then thinks both as the same in kind
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.100]   or as repetitions of the same.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.300]   A thing becomes a unit, number,
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   when it is repeated so that it is within
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.100]   an environment of duplicates itself, number among numbers.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.740]   Several very important consequences
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.260]   for the practical teaching of mathematics
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.020]   can be drawn from the fact formulated.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.940]   The mathematical process may not be introduced
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.460]   before there is a considerable stock of qualitative facts
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.300]   in the child's mind on which to work,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.340]   and not until the child's mental powers
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.020]   are sufficiently developed to take the steps implied
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.740]   in even the simplest mathematical concept.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.100]   It is a question whether we are not tending
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.460]   to introduce the abstractions of mathematics too early.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.260]   The German boy who enters the gymnasium at the age of nine
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.140]   is expected to know only the four fundamental operations
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.740]   on integers, and in his first year,
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.780]   corresponding to our fourth grade,
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.540]   he learns further only the German weights and measures,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.260]   decimal system, and the simplest operation with decimals.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.260]   By this time, our children are introduced
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.020]   to the complexities of fractions, common and decimal,
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.740]   to our system of weights and measures,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.220]   far more complicated than the international decimal system
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.020]   used in Germany, and even sometimes to percentage
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.100]   and some use of generalized, literal numbers.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.260]   And yet the German boy does not come out behind
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.420]   at the end of the race 10 years later.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.380]   It has even been urged that no formal study of mathematics
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.900]   is needed at all, but that pre-collegiate mathematics
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.620]   at least could be developed incidentally
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.780]   in the study of natural phenomena.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.620]   Though this proposal is extreme, it contains much good.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.180]   Yet the time must come when the child sees
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.220]   that he will save himself much trouble
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.940]   if he makes a mathematical tool and practices with it
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.420]   enough to have a fair amount of skill in its use.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.100]   The concrete application gives zest to the work,
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.540]   but there must be occasions when the mathematical process
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.700]   itself is a center of interest.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.220]   It's an article or a book entitled,
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.220]   "That Comes From the Teaching of Mathematics
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.020]   in the Elementary and the Secondary School,"
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.340]   by J.W.A. Young, Longmans, Green & Co, New York,
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.740]   published 1919.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.260]   Math class postponed, quote,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.220]   "Several groups of important investigations
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.920]   on the teaching of arithmetic have contributed findings
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.460]   that have led schools to make changes
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.440]   in the organization of the curriculum.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.060]   One group of studies dealt with the effect of postponing
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.940]   or deferring the teaching of arithmetic
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.460]   in the primary grades.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.500]   Included in this group are the studies by Ballard in 1912,
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.500]   Taylor in 1916, Wilson 1930, and Benezet in 1935 and '36.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.120]   In these studies, formal arithmetic instruction
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.100]   was withheld in one group
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.620]   and administered as usual in another group.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.220]   At the end of the experimental period,
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.980]   the comparative achievements of the two groups were measured.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.940]   In each case, the experimenter recommended
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.660]   the postponement of formal arithmetic.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.820]   Ballard for two years or the age of seven,
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.100]   Taylor for one year, Wilson for two years,
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.660]   and Benezet until grade five.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.140]   On the basis of these and other studies,
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.820]   the plan of eliminating formal arithmetic instruction
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.820]   from grades one and two, sometimes also grade three,
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.720]   has been adopted by a considerable number of school systems.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.120]   In some systems, there is not even an approved plan
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.500]   of informal or incidental arithmetic.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.580]   Such procedure fails to recognize certain
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.100]   very important facts about the studies referred to above.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.420]   A careful reading of the reports
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.620]   of these four experiments shows that,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.300]   while formal practice on computational processes
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.900]   was postponed in the experimental groups,
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.060]   there was a great deal of use made in these classes
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.700]   of various kinds of activities, games,
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.060]   projects, and social situations
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.040]   through which the child was brought into contact
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.300]   with numbers and given the opportunity
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.440]   to use them informally in meaningful ways.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.140]   It is especially clear in the studies
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.780]   by Wilson and Benezet that arithmetic
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.940]   was not in fact postponed at all.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.960]   It is evident that what happened in these two studies
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.780]   was that computational arithmetic was replaced
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.260]   by what I called earlier in this paper social arithmetic.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.820]   In each study, the plan was to emphasize number meanings,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.380]   to develop an understanding of the ways
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.100]   in which number functions in the daily lives of children,
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.800]   both in and out of school,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.180]   and to develop what is called number readiness
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.300]   for the more formal work to follow.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.000]   That comes from an article entitled
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.720]   Deferred Arithmetic, published in Mathematics Teacher,

[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.260]   article by William Burnham, PhD,
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.140]   professor of pedagogy and school hygiene,

[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.460]   Moore says less, quote,
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.560]   "In 1972, under the auspices
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.460]   "of the Hewitt Research Foundation,
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.000]   "we conducted a broad investigation

[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.780]   "We then carefully checked the bibliographies
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.080]   "of relevant items for further sources.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.520]   "These various sources yielded

[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.180]   "About 1,000 items were closely analyzed
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.940]   "and categorized, of which 700 or so
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.540]   "have been included here."
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.980]   Scott cautions wisely that much research
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.100]   and education fails to produce new information
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.740]   that can be used beyond the situation
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.520]   in which it is acquired.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.140]   But when the findings of such studies,
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.140]   in concert with the findings of many other studies,
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.820]   all point in the same direction,
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.380]   the implications deserve examination.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.620]   It is obviously unscholarly, unethical,
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.380]   and unwise to wave aside a possible truth
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.340]   because it does not agree
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.780]   with presently accepted knowledge
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.540]   or conventional practice.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.980]   Some of the trends here identified
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.140]   in early childhood literature
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.780]   are provocative in this respect.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.060]   Here is a challenge to early childhood scholars
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.600]   to reexamine the early childhood dilemma.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.260]   Rower shows that the effects
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.000]   of early instruction in mathematics,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.220]   noted by Austin, were not statistically significant.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:56.140]   What was significant was a strong negative correlation
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.100]   between school entry age and attitudes toward school.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.260]   Additional years in school did not contribute
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.900]   significantly to average performance in mathematics,
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.340]   but the earlier children had started school,
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.120]   the more negative their attitudes toward school.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.360]   Developmental readiness, however,
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.540]   was still the most important factor
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.540]   for doing arithmetic and understanding paragraph meaning.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.100]   A number of studies verify,
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.880]   the younger a child is when he starts to school,
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.820]   the more chronological age appears
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.060]   to affect this process throughout his school life.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.180]   Cumulative records over a period of six years
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.940]   revealed a continued disadvantage,
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.420]   even though as a group, they had a slightly higher IQ
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.260]   than those who entered school from six to nine months later.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.340]   Children in the younger group
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.660]   were also more likely to repeat a grade.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.700]   Fayberg's results showed that successful school achievement
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.220]   in areas requiring use of concepts,
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.340]   such as numbers, classes,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.060]   and spatial and causal relationships,
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.480]   correlated highly with mental age.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.460]   Developing these concepts was especially associated
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.820]   with success in arithmetic, problem solving, and spelling.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.600]   Strom observed that the excessive value
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.980]   attached to academic achievement
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   and the pressures to grow up and achieve earlier
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.180]   could be damaging to personal development.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.380]   If, as neurophysiologists suggest,
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.660]   brain structure and function move along together,
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.740]   requiring a child to undertake tasks
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.700]   for which he is not fully prepared
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.580]   is risking damage to the central nervous system.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.340]   It may also risk potential difficulties
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.900]   in the effective and motivational aspects of learning
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.180]   due to frustration,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.320]   because the learning tools simply are not yet ready.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.500]   Recent findings confirm this.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.780]   If we expect reading and arithmetic based on understanding
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.660]   rather than on rote learning,
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.460]   delay of formal training in these areas appears wise,
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.860]   although informal education
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.180]   through warm parental responses is desirable.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.220]   Some scholars and clinicians conclude
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.340]   that formal education should wait until ages 10 to 14.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.380]   Strong clinical and research evidence
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.780]   indicates that early exposure
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.980]   to the so-called stimulation of school
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.640]   often destroys childhood motivation for learning.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.740]   By grade three or four,
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.800]   many children become stranded on a motivational plateau,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.580]   never recovering their early excitement for learning.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.060]   Most primary teachers agree.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.520]   That comes from a book called "School Can Wait"
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.660]   by Raymond S. and Dorothy N. Moore,
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.420]   Brigham Young University Press, Provo, Utah, published 1982.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.860]   The brain, its plane is sprained if it is strained.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.620]   Quote, "The axons or output parts of brain neurons
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.280]   "gradually develop a coating of a waxy substance
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.820]   "called myelin, which insulates the wiring
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.440]   "and facilitates rapid and clear transmission.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.720]   "At birth, only the most primitive systems,
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.220]   "such as those needed for sucking,
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.080]   "have been coated with myelin.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.340]   "The process of myelination in human brains
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.740]   "is not completed at least until most of us are in our 20s.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.920]   "While animal studies have shown
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.880]   "that total myelin may reflect levels of stimulation,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.140]   "scientists believe its order of development
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.940]   "is mainly predetermined by a genetic program.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.620]   "While the system overall is remarkably responsive
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.640]   "to stimulation from the environment,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.600]   "the schedule of myelination appears to put some boundaries
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.860]   "around appropriate forms of learning at any given age.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.480]   "We should stop for a moment to discuss
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.420]   "some potential hazards in trying too hard
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.700]   "to make intelligence or learning happen.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.220]   "Some of the skill deficits of today's school children,
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.480]   "in fact, may have resulted from academic demands
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.480]   "that were wrong, either in content
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.280]   "or in mode of presentation,
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.420]   "for their level of development.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.140]   "The same mentality that attempts to engineer stimulation
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.520]   "for baby brains also tries to push learning
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.540]   "into school children, much like stuffing sausages.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.280]   "For example, some parents now wonder
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.780]   "if their schools are any good
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.860]   "if they don't start formal reading instruction,
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.180]   "complete with worksheets in preschool.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.480]   "Before brain regions are myelinated,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.680]   "they do not operate efficiently.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.380]   "For this reason, trying to make children
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.660]   "master academic skills for which they do not have
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.980]   "the requisite maturation may result
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.700]   "in mixed up patterns of learning.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.740]   "As we have seen, the essence of functional plasticity
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.060]   "is that any kind of learning,
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.540]   "reading, math, spelling, handwriting, et cetera,
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.100]   "may be accomplished by any of several brain systems.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.860]   "Naturally, we want children to plug each piece of learning
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.580]   "into the best system for that particular job.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.260]   "If the right one isn't yet available
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.960]   "or working smoothly, however,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.360]   "forcing may create a functional organization
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.760]   "in which less adaptive, lower systems
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.820]   "are trained to do the work."
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.700]   As an example, let's take the kind of reasoning
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.160]   needed for understanding,
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.940]   not just memorizing one's way through higher level math.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.640]   Perhaps some readers of this book shared
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.100]   a common experience when they took algebra.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.380]   Many of us functioned adequately until we reached Chicago,
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.860]   where two planes insisted on passing each other
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.220]   every day in class.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.980]   When it wasn't planes, it was trains,
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.980]   people digging wells, or other situations
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.180]   that did not seem in any way related to graphs
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.780]   and equations of X, Y, and Z.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.560]   Personally, I found the more I struggled,
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.100]   the more confused I became,
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.260]   until soon I was learning more confusion than algebra.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.140]   Moreover, I began to believe I was pretty dumb.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.380]   Was I developing what Herman Epstein calls
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.800]   negative neural networks, resistant circuitry,
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.260]   toward this worthy subject?
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.820]   Having fled from math courses
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.540]   at the first available opportunity,
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.100]   I have since talked to other adults
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.680]   who confided that, after a similar experience,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.700]   they also avoided math until forced years later
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.320]   to take a required course in graduate school.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.500]   At this point, their grownup brains discovered
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.080]   that they actually liked this sort of reasoning.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.500]   In this personal example, it is very possible
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.080]   that the necessary neural equipment for algebra,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.940]   taught in this particular manner,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.820]   may not yet have been automatically available
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.140]   in my early adolescent brain.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.640]   The areas to receive the last dose of myelin
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.540]   are the association areas responsible
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.180]   for manipulating highly abstract concepts,
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.800]   such as symbols, X, Y, Z, graphs,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.720]   that stand for other symbols, numerical relationships,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.540]   that stand for real things, planes, trains, wells.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.740]   Such learning is highly experience-dependent,
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.840]   and thus there are many potential neural routes
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.540]   by which it can be performed.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.500]   Trying to drill higher-level learning into immature brains
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.180]   may force them to perform with lower-level systems
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.180]   and thus impair the skill in question.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.640]   I would contend that much of today's school failure
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.060]   results from academic expectations
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.360]   for which students' brains were not prepared,
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.940]   but which were bulldozed into them anyway.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.960]   The brain grows best when it is challenged,
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.500]   so high standards for children's learning are important.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.760]   Nevertheless, curriculum needs to be considered
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.960]   in terms of brain-appropriate challenge.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.180]   Reorganizing synapses is much more difficult
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.200]   than having the patience
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.320]   to help them get arranged properly
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.260]   the first time around.
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.280]   Abstract rule systems for grammar and usage
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.380]   should be taught when most students are in high school.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.920]   Then, if previously prepared,
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.560]   they may even enjoy the challenges
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.480]   of this kind of abstract, logical reasoning,
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.240]   only, however, if the circuits
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.280]   are not already too cluttered up by bungled rule teaching.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.240]   One ninth-grade student who came to me last year
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.360]   for help with grammar was hopelessly confused
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.440]   about the simplest parts of speech.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.960]   Although she was intelligent and could, at her current age,
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.880]   have mastered this material in a week,
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.600]   she had been a victim of meaningless grammar drills
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.040]   since second grade.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.220]   As Michelle and I struggled on the simple difference
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.560]   between adjectives and adverbs,
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   I often wished I could take a neurological vacuum cleaner
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.900]   and just suck out all those mixed-up synapses
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.560]   that kept getting in our way.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.360]   It took us six months,
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.120]   but finally, one day, the light dawned.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   "This is easy," she exclaimed.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.320]   "It is."
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.040]   When brains are primed for the learning,
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.860]   and the student has a reason to use it,
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.040]   we're left with real literary models.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.680]   Immersing children in good language from books and tapes,
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.400]   modeling patterns for their own speech and writing,
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   and letting them enjoy their proficiency
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.040]   in using words to manipulate ideas
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.340]   are valid ways to embed grammar in growing brains.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.840]   No amount of worksheets or rule learning
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.560]   will ever make up for deficits
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.820]   resulting from lack of experience
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.520]   with the structure of real, meaningful sentences.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.380]   It is folly to ignore the importance of oral storytelling,
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.900]   oral history, and public speaking
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.760]   in a world that will communicate increasingly
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.920]   without the mediation of print.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   These skills build language competence in grammar,
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.760]   memory, attention, and visualization,
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   among many other abilities.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.260]   I personally believe that helping students
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.380]   at all grade levels memorize some pieces of good writing,
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.680]   narrative, expository, and poetic on a regular basis
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.000]   would provide good practice
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.520]   for language, listening, and attention.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.560]   I do not mean reverting to a rote-level curriculum,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.200]   but simply taking a little time each week
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.100]   to celebrate the sounds of literate thought.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.200]   At the same time, schools must get into the business
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.560]   of teaching children to listen effectively,
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.480]   because no one else seems to be doing it.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.400]   That is from a book entitled
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.360]   "Endangered Minds, Why Children Don't Think,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.600]   and What We Can Do About It" by Jane Healy,
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.080]   Simon & Schuster, published 1990.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.360]   What should we then do?
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.760]   Historically, the age for instruction
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.840]   in arithmetic and mathematics
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.120]   seems to have slowly shifted from age 15 or later
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.080]   down to age 10.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.320]   Then, about a century ago,
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.880]   this was shifted again to about age seven or six.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.400]   In very recent times, it has shifted again to age five
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.040]   or four, but recorded history may not be the place to go
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.120]   in order to find substantive support
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.240]   for the practice of beginning formal instruction
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.840]   in arithmetic at any age, five, 10, or 15.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.700]   There is more material in arithmetic and mathematics
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.440]   to learn and to use today than the ancients studied.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.480]   Some may argue that starting earlier
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.360]   allows more time to learn more material.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.760]   It seems obvious to them that if a child learns
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.600]   to do multiplication and division at age 10,
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.400]   then he is five years ahead of the child
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.920]   who learns to do multiplication and division at age 15,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.280]   right?
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.520]   Perhaps.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.160]   So if we teach him to multiply and divide at age five,
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.640]   he would be 10 years ahead.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.680]   At birth, 15 years ahead.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   Get the point?
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.520]   This is more than merely an issue of enough time.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.080]   This is an issue of development.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.960]   How much math there is to learn
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.040]   and how early children may have been forced
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.360]   to learn some math.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.280]   These considerations do not give us data
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.160]   to define the time when it is most effective
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.600]   and most efficient to begin teaching arithmetic
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.480]   and mathematics.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.240]   Most obviously, there is a time when it is too early.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.540]   Those who advocate formal arithmetic at age five
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.880]   appear to have ignored this developmental issue.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.800]   And when the results are not like they want,
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.400]   they patch them up with experimental classroom methods
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.920]   which try to emulate informal experiences in arithmetic,
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.840]   a tacit witness to informal instruction before age 10.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.200]   In our culture, we erroneously perceive
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.360]   that the only way anyone anywhere at any time
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.760]   can learn arithmetic is from early formal instruction,
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   usually in a classroom school.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.960]   But young children have learned the basic concepts
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.640]   of number in every culture without any formal instruction.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.740]   Games, measurements, and commercial activity
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.680]   have been the primary childhood instructors.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.800]   They are still the best instructors of young children.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.960]   Withholding formal instruction until age 10
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.560]   will by no means guarantee failure.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.720]   Depending on what arithmetic activities are done,
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:27.000]   it may actually guarantee the child's success.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.680]   What we suggest is, one, formal textbook
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.840]   or workbook instruction in arithmetic may begin at age 10.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.080]   It is about age 10 that the developmental light bulb goes on
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.160]   and the child becomes capable of a great deal more mental
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.920]   and physical skill.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.100]   Of course, that's not an absolute rule.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.240]   With a few children, it is as early as eight.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.800]   We call them bright children
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.480]   because the developmental light bulb goes on early.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.240]   Waiting until the child is developmentally prepared
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.880]   to handle the concepts makes instruction in arithmetic
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.480]   very easy because the child learns very quickly.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.520]   Two, there is no necessity for formal teaching
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.860]   in arithmetic before age 10.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.440]   Once all of the developmental parts are there,
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.120]   most children can learn in a few weeks
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.160]   everything which they might have spent six years learning,
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.940]   kindergarten through fifth grade.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.520]   That is, if they haven't already learned it
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.040]   through questions and experiences
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.200]   and working things out on their own,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.360]   which is generally the case.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.040]   Three, depending upon the child, upon the method,
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.960]   and upon the subject matter covered,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.120]   there exists the potential for developmental harm
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.600]   from the formal teaching of arithmetic before age 10.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.520]   Small children cannot understand
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.180]   many arithmetic concepts at an early age.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.440]   We can teach them to perform the process,
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.040]   but we cannot make them understand the concepts.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:50.000]   The child learns to hate learning.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.600]   The child's understanding develops along the wrong lines.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.800]   He may actually develop mental blocks to arithmetic,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.040]   actual physiological blocks in the brain.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.560]   This may give new meaning for the term blockhead.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:08.720]   Four, not formally teaching arithmetic before age 10
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.420]   frees up a lot of time for other activities
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.380]   which will build the vocabulary of the child.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:18.640]   Vocabulary is the number one index of intelligence.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.220]   Developing vocabulary was one of the deliberate foci
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.940]   of ancient education.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.280]   We waste valuable time for developing vocabulary
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:31.260]   and verbal language skills if we instead spend those hours
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.940]   teaching a five-year-old to count by fives.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.880]   He'll know it intuitively by age 10 anyway
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.740]   without ever being taught.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.900]   Instead, we ought to spend those hours reading to him.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.860]   We only have so much time in the day.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.460]   Do we wanna spend it trying to force math skills
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:49.300]   into a child who developmentally is not optimally prepared
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.840]   or spend it doing what is developmentally natural
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.260]   to a young child, learning new words
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.180]   and associating them with new ideas and experiences?
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:02.200]   Stretch the child's vocabulary during the formative years
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.100]   and when he's developmentally ready
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.620]   to do some deeper thinking,
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.940]   he'll have a mind prepared to take on the task
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.900]   and he'll take off like a rocket.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.780]   Please note, we are not saying that no child
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.180]   should ever utter the name of a number before age 10.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.440]   Not at all.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.020]   About age four, most children discover money
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.860]   and there is no hiding numbers from them after that.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.500]   They encounter numbers all of the time.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.700]   If we encourage learning,
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.340]   then they'll be asking lots of questions
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.540]   and we'll be full of opportunities
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.440]   to teach numbers and measurement.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.660]   But we would not encourage using a formal workbook
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.580]   before age 10 unless the child has a genuine desire
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.660]   to do so.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.860]   He shows that he is competent to handle the work
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:47.100]   and it does not take away time from other valuable activities
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.020]   We are not going to ruin the child
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.820]   if we wait until age 10 before beginning
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.520]   the formal teaching of arithmetic.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:02.320]   Thus concludes the appendix of teaching the trivium,
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.220]   Christian homeschooling in a classical style
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.020]   by Harvey and Laurie Bludhorn.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.820]   Again, I wanted to hasten to add this
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.900]   after focusing so heavily on the value
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.260]   of using mathematics as a way to grow our children's brains.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.020]   And I want you to be aware because as parents,
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.380]   all of us feel this intense pressure
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:29.140]   from other parents around us, perhaps our parents,
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.060]   perhaps school administrators and authorities
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.680]   who in some cases are quite literally looking
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.440]   over our shoulder, inspecting our work, et cetera.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.940]   And we read stories about incredible prodigy children
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.780]   who can do all these incredible things.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.980]   And we all say, well, I just gotta get after it.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.620]   Gotta push, push, push, push, push, push, push.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:53.620]   But we need to not be influenced by those things
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.340]   and recognize that there is a time
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.580]   and a place to do everything.
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.740]   And that just because you can do something
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.860]   at an early age doesn't mean that you should do something
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.660]   at an early age.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.340]   There are three basic concepts
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.420]   that I think are important for learning.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.900]   And let me use a physical example, right?
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.500]   Because we can look at physical development.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.380]   I'm tempted to use an example
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.980]   from the sexual development of children,
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.860]   but I'll let you consider that on your own.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.440]   And instead I'll substitute something like running.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.940]   I would bet that we could teach and train a five-year-old
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.100]   to run marathons.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.100]   I'm not aware of five-year-olds who have run marathons,
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.220]   although I'm certain that there are some
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.140]   that could walk run them.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.940]   But I would bet you that we could train
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:48.260]   our five-year-old children to run a marathon.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:52.140]   Question is, does that mean that we should train
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.860]   our five-year-old children to run marathons?
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.860]   First, we say, what is the purpose
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.500]   of running a marathon in the first place?
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.460]   Why is that necessary?
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.860]   Why are we doing it at all?
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.460]   And you can see that running a marathon
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.500]   could be a useful expression of development,
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.860]   but that doesn't mean that age five is the age to start.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.540]   It seems much more natural to have, say,
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.380]   a 13-year-old or a 15-year-old,
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:26.220]   somebody who's approaching that adult space,
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.460]   start to engage in marathon training.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.860]   And again, I don't know anything about teaching
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.620]   five-year-olds to run long distances,
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.460]   but it would just seem to me very inefficient
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.120]   to try to get a five-year-old who has physically small legs
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.740]   and physically small lungs, et cetera,
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.060]   to try to become an elite long-distance runner.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.660]   And while we might encourage running,
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:50.540]   we may not choose a formalized training system.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:55.060]   Number two, if we want our five-year-olds to enjoy running,
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.700]   we probably ought not to inflict upon them
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:03.240]   the kind of marathon training
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:07.980]   that an elite Kenyan marathon runner engages in,
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.140]   the hours and the hours and the hours of grinding.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:14.440]   That would probably be a pretty decent way
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:18.220]   to destroy our child's love of running.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.420]   So even if we did have a five-year-old
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.500]   who was spectacularly capable at running,
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.220]   we don't want to inflict upon the five-year-old
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.140]   a professional marathoner's training schedule.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.900]   The professional marathoner,
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.820]   while perhaps he doesn't love every minute of his training,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:37.160]   on the whole is going to enjoy his training.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.080]   Otherwise he's not gonna do it.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.220]   But the child is not ready for such a grueling pace
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.580]   and does not get the same sense of fulfillment
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.540]   by doing hard things that the adult does.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.860]   And then third and finally,
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.500]   let's assume that we have a five-year-old
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.940]   who is skilled at running and we want to encourage running.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:00.420]   Doesn't it seem that there are better ways to do that?
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:04.100]   Taking our child and putting him on a soccer team
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.460]   or just playing pickup games of soccer
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.380]   or some other running-based sport
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.140]   is a much more natural way of indulging
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.540]   that love of learning.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:16.500]   And we can encourage him to develop his heart,
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.980]   develop his lungs, develop his legs,
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.820]   but we can do it in the format
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.340]   that is more appropriate to a child.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.500]   And then we can wait and see in the fullness of time.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.380]   Well, by way of analogy,
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.940]   we ought to look at mathematics the same way.
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:33.480]   Mathematical ability is wonderful, it's great.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.420]   And in the fullness of time,
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:37.740]   perhaps we will want to press and press and press
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.260]   our children to achieve their personal
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.780]   mathematical potential.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.740]   But let's not do it in a way
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:48.260]   that is inappropriate for young children.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.100]   Let's bring in the mathematics
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.720]   in a simpler, more informal way.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.480]   Let's wait for the child to be developmentally ready
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.980]   before we really go after it.
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.980]   And let's try to nurture the child's love of learning.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.740]   If you want your child
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.140]   to be a lifelong mathematical expert,
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.280]   then you will need to nurture his love of mathematics,
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.100]   not grind it out of him at an excessively young age.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.520]   One final comment.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.180]   I mentioned that I was not myself
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.220]   specifically following this rule
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.940]   of no formalized mathematics until age 10.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.940]   It's not because I disagree with the advice,
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:36.620]   but rather it's that I didn't come across the advice
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.500]   until very recently.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.380]   I didn't read this book until last year.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.000]   And what sparked my interest in this
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.940]   was studying mathematical curricula
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.900]   and thinking about what curriculum I'm interested in using
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.060]   for my children in high school ages.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.940]   And I was reading essays by math teachers
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.740]   and one of them said very clearly,
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.100]   don't put your children in algebra
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.480]   until they have hair on their armpits.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.140]   And I thought that's an interesting
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.460]   and quite provocative, vivid image to think about.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.240]   And then when I found this other book
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.500]   that I just got last year and read,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.460]   it so impressed me that I thought,
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.260]   I think there's something here
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.500]   and I think more of us should pay attention to it.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.420]   But I'd already started
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:22.320]   on the traditional workbook program.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.820]   My children have been using math workbook texts
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.300]   since first grade.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.540]   Now, they're fairly light
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.180]   and I haven't identified them to be causing problems,
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.760]   but I was already kind of on
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.840]   what is now the traditional path.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.900]   And I've continued on it.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.380]   What I have noticed is that my eldest children
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.280]   who are using workbook maths,
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.420]   I think are mentally a little older
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.440]   than a lot of their peers.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.140]   I've noticed quite a bit more kind of mental age.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.540]   And so I've tried to be careful
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.280]   and I definitely don't want to overwhelm them.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.300]   This point, I'm not stopping intentionally
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.460]   the workbook math,
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.500]   but I am very free in my mind
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.780]   that if math is causing problems,
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.180]   then I'm going to release it
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.700]   and use this concept of waiting on the formalized stuff
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.300]   until a later age.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.500]   And I think that it's important that we talk about this
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.360]   because there are a lot of tears shed
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.400]   in many children's bedrooms over math
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.720]   and it ought not to be so.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.760]   The other thing I have spent a lot of time thinking about
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.440]   is, okay, what can we do with the time instead?
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.160]   Now, when we get to training the soul or the character,
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.400]   I would point out there's a lot that a child needs
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.760]   that doesn't fit into an academic rubric.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.560]   I believe children need hours and hours
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.720]   playing outside with their friends or with their siblings,
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.920]   just complete unencumbered free play.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.500]   That's really important to me.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.740]   And I don't want to sit around and do workbook math.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.860]   I mean, some of the Asian cultures,
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.100]   I admire them for their mathematical prowess.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.540]   And sometimes when I have been there physically
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.860]   or spoken to people about some of the intensity,
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.180]   I cry for the lack of childhood development
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.100]   that can happen with just playing outside in the woods
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.220]   with your friends.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.020]   And so that's an option.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.100]   I think the thing that you can definitely press
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.500]   at a young age is language development.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.140]   I can't see any downside to language development.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.940]   I see downsides to other things.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.940]   So if we think about the three Rs,
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.060]   which I've stolen from Naval, has now five points,
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.460]   that what is education?
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.180]   Well, it's reading, writing, arithmetic, coding,
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.680]   computer coding, and persuasion.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.540]   Well, persuasion is something that can clearly wait
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.140]   till a later age, right?
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.700]   We can talk about that in terms of rhetoric
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.180]   at a later stage in adolescence and beyond stage
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.780]   where we can formally study persuasion.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.620]   Coding, I don't see any benefit to starting at a young age.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.020]   I'm open to research, to the contrary,
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.860]   but I haven't found any computer science expert,
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.380]   any programmer, et cetera, who has said,
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.100]   "No, Joshua, absolutely, you have to start coding
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.180]   at the age of five in order to be a world-class coder."
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.660]   I don't know the specific age, but I think at least age 10,
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.640]   more likely age 13 or so, and is probably fine for coding,
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.000]   even though I have looked at some of the curricula
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.740]   that have been developed for bringing coding
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.900]   into first grade, et cetera,
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.900]   and I'll talk about that in a separate show.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.220]   Well, reading, writing, arithmetic.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.540]   We talked about arithmetic today.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.740]   What about writing?
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.540]   Well, for writing, a child needs a certain amount
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.580]   of physically writing, right, a certain amount
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.440]   of coordination, muscular skill,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.180]   hand-eye coordination, et cetera.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.780]   The child needs something to say,
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.900]   and so I think that formal writing should be delayed.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.580]   Now, what we do is we practice what's called narration,
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.380]   which is preparation for writing.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.080]   Narration is something that is the verbal equivalent
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.640]   of writing that allows the child
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.380]   to practice composing thoughts
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.940]   and basically composing small essays,
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.740]   but without the limiting effect of writing,
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.060]   'cause writing needs time to develop that strength
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.060]   and that muscular fluidity.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.940]   Well, reading is also important,
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.820]   but we don't wanna try to force our three-year-olds to read.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.820]   We wanna encourage them to read when they're capable,
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:00.300]   but we wanna encourage them, but we wanna be thoughtful.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.700]   So at its core, what is the thing that we can do
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.860]   that's not going to harm our child?
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.940]   Well, number one is, again, play, relationships,
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.700]   character development, a huge thing,
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.340]   intentionally trained habits in the character,
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.180]   but we can do language development.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.220]   A child who is three is in a mode
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.140]   of rapid language acquisition.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.740]   So it was a child who's five, who's seven,
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.660]   who's eight, and who's 10, et cetera.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.620]   So this is the age at which the child
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.600]   is wired for language acquisition.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.700]   So we wanna emphasize lots and lots of language.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.020]   And even if that's not physically reading
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.700]   until the child is ready,
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.100]   then two hours of reading aloud to the child,
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.300]   say two hours of audio books as well,
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.620]   you're gonna have lots and lots of language acquisition.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.700]   And so help your child to develop that broad vocabulary
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.060]   that we talked about previously.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.420]   Also, what is a subset of language development?
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.380]   Well, other languages.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.820]   A child's young brain,
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.540]   while I'll discuss this separately,
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.900]   I do not think that a child is necessarily
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.240]   a better learner of languages than an adult's.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.780]   That is certainly an interest,
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.500]   and the child's brain is very open to languages.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.640]   And that's where we will go next.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.440]   If you want to help your children to be smarter,
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.780]   then help them to learn multiple languages at an early age,
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.660]   even if you do this somewhat intensively.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.720]   That same aspect of normal life
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.080]   can be a component
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.340]   of basically intensive language acquisition.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.700]   If you pick your family out from Atlanta to Georgia
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.220]   and move to Hong Kong
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.700]   and put your child into a local play group,
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.620]   or let's choose a different place
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.660]   with a little bit more nature,
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.940]   into a rural China or somewhere,
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.720]   then your child is gonna be outwardly playing and running
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.220]   and playing in the woods,
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.460]   but is going to be in a very intense period
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.700]   of language acquisition.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.940]   And the same thing can be done, of course, right at home.
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.060]   And so that's where we go next,
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.020]   is let's talk about multilingualism
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.580]   as a way to enhance your child's intelligence.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.260]   Hope this essay helps you to consider
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.760]   what is right for you and yours.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.460]   Always remember, you're the parent, you know your child.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.380]   It is your job to make sure that the teachers
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.420]   that you have brought to help your child
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.180]   are not harming him, but are helping him.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.360]   And thus, that's why I want you to be equipped
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.260]   with this information and background.
