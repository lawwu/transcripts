[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   Hi, I'm here with Abner Chow, the lead translator for the LSB.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.800]   Abner, how's Shepherds Conference going for you?
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.120]   Ah, Gary, thanks for meeting with me.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.760]   Yeah, it's, it's such a blessing.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.800]   I'm so encouraged to see so many pastors all together, fellowshipping, celebrating
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.960]   the Lord and encouraging each other.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.120]   And for me personally, not only is that encouraging, but the opportunity to serve
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.800]   them in so many different ways is such a joy to my own soul.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.640]   So this is a very busy time and it can be a very exhausting time, but it's a time that
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.240]   reminds us and gives us a foretaste of the fruitfulness of what the Lord is doing
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.640]   across the entire world.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.760]   And so that is a great joy.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.400]   Praise God.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.320]   And Abner, because you're the lead translator, I'm sure you get asked tons of
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.640]   questions, but what is one of the most frequently asked questions to you?
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.120]   Yeah, one of the most frequently asked questions is besides the changes of Yahweh
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.440]   and translating Dulas as slave, what really makes the LSB so unique?
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.840]   Well, why did you guys do it and, and why are those other kinds of changes
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.560]   significant?
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.800]   And of course, we often talk about the issue of consistency and for pastors who are
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.200]   going through the word of God and they're pointing things out.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.360]   Even John Piper did this in his recent message where he, or in the Q&A, where he
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.680]   said, look, Paul says those who loved Christ's coming, and then a verse or two
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.720]   later, Demas loved this present age.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.680]   And people all just said, Oh, because they made the connection in the text.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.640]   And what our job is, is to make sure that those kinds of connections can be easily
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.280]   facilitated all over scripture because we're consistent.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.320]   Awesome.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.520]   Thank you Abner for your time.
