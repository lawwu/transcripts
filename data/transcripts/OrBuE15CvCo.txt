[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   I'm a quantum physicist and we quantum physicists don't believe that the Big Bang happened once.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.880]   That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.140]   And that means that there could be multiple bangs happening all the time.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.940]   Even as we speak today, universes are being created.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.600]   That fits the data.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.440]   The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.800]   So there's a certain finite probability that universes are being created all the time.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.040]   And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing because, you know, I was raised as
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.720]   a Presbyterian, but my parents were Buddhists.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.560]   And there's two diametrically opposed ideas about the universe.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.760]   In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.440]   There's no beginning, there's no end, there's only timelessness.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.160]   But in Christianity, there is the instant when God said, "Let there be light."
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.840]   In other words, an instant of creation.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.160]   So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head, and I now realize that it's possible
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.720]   to meld them into a single theory.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.400]   Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   Wrong.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.640]   You see, our universe had a beginning.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.320]   Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said, "Let there be light."
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.400]   But there are other bubble universes out there in a bubble bath of universes.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.280]   And that means that these universes are expanding into a dimension beyond our three-dimensional
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.640]   comprehension.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.500]   In other words, hyperspace.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.840]   In other words, 11-dimensional hyperspace.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.160]   So nirvana would be this timeless 11-dimensional hyperspace where big bangs are happening all
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.320]   the time.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.480]   So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories of creation.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.400]   And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book, even said that this is an argument
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.880]   against the existence of God.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.480]   He said there is no God because there was not enough time for God to create the universe
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.520]   because the big bang happened in an instant of time.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.760]   Therefore there was no time available for him to create the universe.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.640]   But you see, the multiverse idea means that there was a time before time.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.080]   And there are multiple times.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.560]   Each bubble has its own time.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.520]   And so it means that there could actually be a universe before the beginning of our
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.040]   universe.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.320]   So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide, or when two bubbles fission
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.200]   to create a baby bubble, that's called the big bang.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.600]   So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes or the budding of universes.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.100]   Thanks.
