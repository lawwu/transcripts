[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.480]   Which brings us to number six.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.120]   How am I doing?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.200]   Good?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.240]   Good, thanks.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.480]   Number six, use index funds when possible.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.400]   Why when possible?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.280]   Because it's not always possible.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.880]   I mean, there are people, I'm sure, in this room who
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.200]   belong to a 403(b) plan of some sort,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.120]   and it's a horrendous plan.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.720]   And all they have is actively managed funds.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.280]   And you can't get an index fund.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.640]   Or maybe there's just one index fund available,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.080]   and it's an S&P 500 fund, perhaps.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.640]   So when possible, though, use index funds.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.560]   And I'm going to explain why.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.080]   First, before I do that, I have to explain
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.280]   what an index fund is.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.240]   So this is how I like to explain.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   Again, I'm using pictures.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.240]   On the left side, you have companies--
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.920]   Exxon, Apple, Home Depot, Google, whatever,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.640]   hundreds of them.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.440]   In fact, there are 4,200 companies in the United States.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.960]   But these companies are publicly traded.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.240]   They're publicly traded on a stock market, daily.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.480]   Google trades, Apple trades, all these stocks
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.160]   are trading on a daily basis.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.360]   Well, there are companies, such as Standard & Poor's,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.960]   who keep track of all this trading,
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.120]   keep track of all these prices.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.320]   And the big companies will weigh more in their index
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.720]   than the smaller companies or the tiny companies.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.960]   So indexes are what's called capitalization weighting.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960]   The big companies have a much bigger weighting.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.500]   And then the smaller companies have a much smaller weighting.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.920]   So you get this tier down here.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.400]   So obviously, Apple, Home Depot, Google, and so on,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.880]   these are big weightings in the S&P 500.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080]   But they keep track of that.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.560]   Because this is the capitalization weight
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.040]   of the stock market.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.600]   So it is the investable universe.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680]   If you had money to invest in the market
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.240]   and you were looking for stocks to invest in,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.340]   you'd go to the S&P 500 or go to the total stock market, which
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.920]   has 4,200.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.540]   And it's the investable universe by market capitalization.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.800]   Now, what companies like Vanguard did--
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.320]   and Vanguard did this, Jack Bogle did this back in 1976--
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.000]   they went to Standard & Poor's.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.640]   And they said, we want to license your index.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.000]   And Standard & Poor's David Blitzer,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.680]   who happened to be the head of the index committee
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.460]   at the time, remembered the conversation.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.080]   In fact, I did a podcast with David.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720]   And he remembered this conversation.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.200]   He said, why would you want to do that?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   You want to create an index fund?
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.600]   And Vanguard, Jack Bogle said, yes.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   How much would you charge us to create an S&P 500 index fund?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.480]   And S&P didn't know what the answer was.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.080]   So they agreed on $25,000 was the fit.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.040]   Well, little did they know what would happen next, right?
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.080]   Vanguard creates the Vanguard 500.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   At the time, it wasn't called the Vanguard 500.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.460]   But they created that index fund.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.080]   And they launched it out.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.000]   Now, it took 10 years before that fund
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.400]   got a billion dollars in it.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.480]   But as it grew and as S&P realized
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.560]   that this is really something, indexing,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   that they went back to Vanguard.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.200]   And they renegotiated the contract.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.940]   And a few years later, Vanguard actually left S&P
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.360]   and went to MSCI.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   And now they're at CRISP because S&P
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.520]   was charging too much money.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.820]   There's nobody here from S&P. But I can say that.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.200]   So I know the inside story.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   Anyway, so there's a big competitive market out there
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   for these indexes.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.240]   But this is an index.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.080]   So you end up with an S&P 500, which
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.360]   tracks those 500 stocks, which are tracking
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.760]   the big stocks on the stock exchange, which those companies
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.860]   actually exist.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.840]   And that's how they capitalize themselves.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.080]   So that's an index.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.160]   S&P 500 is just an example.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.760]   Total market would be all 4,200.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.360]   Then there are international stocks, same thing.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   6,500 or so stocks traded outside the US.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   Index is created the same way.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.200]   And there are bonds, bond indices, treasury bonds,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.680]   corporate bonds, mortgages, all put together
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.880]   into the Bloomberg Aggregate Corporate Bond Index.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.560]   And I did a podcast with the people who run the index
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.720]   and also the people at Vanguard who run that fund.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.680]   And it's really interesting to talk to the two.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.280]   So there's all the indexes out there all over the place
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.960]   covering all kinds of asset classes.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   And you have a choice now.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.400]   You didn't have it 45 years ago.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.720]   But you have it now.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.480]   You can either buy an index fund that tracks those indices,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.440]   and it's at a very low fee.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.320]   Or you can do the kind of the traditional thing
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.480]   50 years ago, 40 years ago, which
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.960]   is to try to pick a money manager or a mutual fund that
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.600]   is actively managed that's going to beat that index.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720]   So large cap US stock manager who's
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   going to go out and try to beat the S&P 500.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.400]   So you can either-- that's active management.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.800]   And you can do this in international stocks and bonds
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.240]   and so forth.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.560]   Now, here's the kicker.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.760]   What has happened since Jack Bogle and Vanguard
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.520]   created the first index fund?
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.120]   And index funds have proliferated
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.480]   into all these other asset classes.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.800]   My very first podcast was with Jack Bogle.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.840]   And we talked about this.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.520]   By 1996, Vanguard had a total stock market index fund,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.680]   a total international stock index fund, a total bond market
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.640]   index fund.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.080]   And it had a REIT index fund, Real Estate Investment Trust.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.240]   So pretty much had the four core four type portfolio of index
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.080]   funds, all available at Vanguard, all low cost.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.480]   And how have those funds performed
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.320]   relative to the actively managed funds that were
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.920]   trying to beat those indices?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.520]   Well, let's take a look.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.800]   This is what's called the SPIVA.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   Now, my last podcast I just did was with Craig Lazara
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   from Standard & Poor's Indices, Standard & Poor's Dow Jones
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.280]   Indices, because they merged.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.320]   And what this shows-- this is just looking at one segment.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.480]   This is the S&P 500 index versus the managers who are
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.440]   trying to outperform the index.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.760]   Those numbers, large cap fund up on top,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.400]   and then mid cap fund, which is a mid cap
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.520]   indice, and the bottom, which is an S&P small cap.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.680]   After one year, 55%--
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.840]   let's read in the top line, skip year to date
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.920]   and just go to one year--
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.560]   55% of the active managers underperformed the S&P 500.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.400]   If we go out further and we look at five years--
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.720]   and these are the managers who survived,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.600]   because so many actively managed funds just go under.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.680]   They go out of business.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   The mutual fund companies won't tell you this.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.520]   When you look at the mutual fund advertising,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.800]   they're going to advertise all the funds that survived
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.720]   and actually did well.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.760]   They're not going to show you the other half that
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   all went out of business.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.260]   They're not going to show you those.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.840]   So over a five year period of time, of the funds that
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:14.320]   actually made it five years, 84% underperformed the S&P 500.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.960]   If you go out 20 years, 95% of all actively managed large cap
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.360]   mutual funds that were trying to beat the market
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   underperformed the S&P 500.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.960]   And if we go to the mid cap, which are smaller companies,
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.880]   but not small cap, tiny companies, we go to the right.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.640]   And look at that.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.960]   94% over a 20 year period of time of the active managers
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.440]   in the mid cap sector of the market
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.620]   underperformed the mid cap index.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.920]   And let's go a little further to the small cap funds, which
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.960]   are the small companies.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.560]   And we'll use the S&P 600 small cap index.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.200]   94% of the active managers who attempted
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.440]   to outperform the small cap index underperformed it.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.840]   All right.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.100]   Now, am I going to spend my money
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.600]   trying to pick the 5%?
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.640]   No.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.080]   I can be in the top 95% tile over a 20 year period of time
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   just by buying an index fund.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.160]   And I know that there are going to be a few active managers
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.680]   out there.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.260]   And all these asset classes across the globe,
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.140]   there's going to be a few that do outperform.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.360]   But we don't know who they are today.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.640]   And is it worth going after these managers?
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.720]   And the answer is no, it isn't.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.840]   If we look at why this occurs, the answer is very simple.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.600]   And Alan Walters is going to get to this in more detail
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.640]   in the next session.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.680]   It has to do with fees.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.960]   Almost 100% having to do with fees.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.040]   And then it has to do with managers turnover
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.840]   and have to do with funds get too much money
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   and they can't invest the way they used to invest.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.180]   There are a few other things.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.280]   But I think, Alan, when you see his presentation,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.200]   he's going to talk a lot more about fees.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.740]   So index funds have very low fees.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.960]   Active managers cost money.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.540]   They have all these research analysts
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.080]   and everybody else they have to hire.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.180]   It's more money.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.260]   So generally, the low cost of the index funds
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.500]   is the reason over the very long term
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.860]   that the index funds float to the top
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.340]   and get into the top 90%, 95% tile.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.460]   And this not only happens in the United States.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.700]   It happens internationally.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.740]   It happens in bonds.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.260]   It pretty much happens everywhere.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.300]   And I don't want to get into the details too much.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.140]   But if you look at the SPIVA scorecard or the Vanguard
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.260]   studies that they do every year, Morningstar does studies
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.420]   on this every single year.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.080]   The proliferation of the studies,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.460]   there's a lot of them out there right now.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.140]   20 years ago, they weren't out there.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.640]   You had to dig it up.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.060]   When Jack Bogle first created the index fund in 1996,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.060]   he had to, by hand, by hand, go back and pull out
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.280]   all the performance of each of the individual index actively
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.820]   managed funds and put together his own database because there
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.380]   was no Morningstar out there at that time.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.980]   Nobody was collecting this data.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.420]   This data really wasn't prevalent until around 1997
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.420]   when Mark Carhart from the University of Chicago
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.940]   actually put together the first comprehensive survivorship
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.380]   bias-free database.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.160]   And then now we see that, hey, most active managers
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.540]   don't outperform the market.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.140]   Most will underperform.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.460]   So what do you do?
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.060]   What do I do?
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.580]   What do I believe?
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.500]   I did a study 10 years ago now that was published.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.700]   I said if all you did was buy index funds in every asset
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.140]   class, however many asset classes you want--
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.860]   this is the three-fund portfolio,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.300]   which is the total stock market, US,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.660]   the total international stock market,
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.180]   and just a total bond fund.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.140]   If this is all you did, just bought a few good low-cost
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.540]   index funds in the asset classes that you want,
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.780]   you will be in the 90th percentile of all investors.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.420]   You're going to be at the top 10%.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.780]   Will you be number one?
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.020]   No.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.300]   I don't have to be number one.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.100]   I mean, I'm a good pickleball player.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.860]   Really?
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.460]   I think I am.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.660]   But am I number one?
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.460]   No.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.660]   That's OK.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.100]   I could be in the 95th percentile.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.020]   I'll be happy with that.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.980]   And I think the same way with our portfolios.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.940]   We try to outperform.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.220]   Odds are, high chance you're going to underperform.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.860]   It's going to cost you more money.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.340]   And we're not even getting into the taxes of the turnover
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.420]   of going from this fund to that fund to this fund.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.940]   So this is why we say at the Bogleheads,
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.700]   use index funds when they're available.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.660]   Use them in every single asset class.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.660]   Don't worry about anything else.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.100]   Just invest in a few good index funds.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.180]   And that's it for me.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.240]   you
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
