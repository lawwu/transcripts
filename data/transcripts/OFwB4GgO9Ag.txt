[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   What I'm getting at is, I think if anyone out there
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.040]   is in a very know-it-all place where they can't stop
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.440]   but give people answers and solve their problems
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.040]   instead of listening to their problems,
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.420]   get out of your own comfort zone.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.960]   Get into a place where you don't know
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.240]   what you're talking about because there,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.320]   you're just going to shut up more
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.800]   and give direction and advice less
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.280]   and it'll build a better habit for you.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.600]   And I think that if you do that,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.560]   you're going to be much more open to listening to people
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.880]   and less to giving them advice.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.200]   You're going to be much more open
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   to not knowing and looking for understanding.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.640]   And I think that I was blessed with Mixergy,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.400]   my podcast of 15 years,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480]   in that I really started it after I failed.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.400]   The thing that made it into a podcast
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.240]   was this video that I posted where I said,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.680]   "I was starting a software company and I failed.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.320]   "I'm going to do interviews with people
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.760]   "to learn how to not fail this way again."
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.440]   And if I've admitted to myself in the world that I failed,
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.320]   that I don't know how to do entrepreneurship
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.180]   the way that I wanted to, the way that I thought I could,
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560]   now when someone came to me, I couldn't give them advice.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680]   I just admitted I don't know everything.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.840]   I had to ask questions and learn.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.280]   I had to say, "I don't know enough
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.660]   "and that's why I'm interviewing these people.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.000]   "Let me ask them."
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.120]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.760]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.680]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.920]   and I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.440]   to get you the best experience in life
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.120]   without an expensive price tag.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.960]   To make that happen,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.080]   I'm sitting down with the world's best experts every week
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.240]   to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.680]   that shape their success.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.600]   Today, I'm talking with Andrew Warner,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.680]   a serial entrepreneur who in his 20s
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.520]   started a successful internet business
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.480]   doing 30 million in sales.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.060]   Later, he started Mixergy,
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.760]   a platform that offers interviews, courses, and mentorship
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.360]   to help founders learn to grow their businesses.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.600]   And since 2008, he's hosted Startup Stories,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.800]   a podcast where he's interviewed over 2,000 entrepreneurs
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.920]   from Ryan Holiday to Robert Greene.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160]   I've listened to many episodes in my days
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.240]   and it's a fantastic show.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.880]   But today, we're actually gonna talk about his book,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.320]   "Stop Asking Questions, How to Lead High-Impact Interviews
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.640]   "and Learn Anything from Anyone."
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.980]   But don't think that because you're not a podcast host
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.680]   or a professional interviewer that this isn't for you.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.360]   We're gonna learn how you can be a better,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   more interesting conversationalist in all kinds of settings,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.560]   from networking, to job interviews,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.800]   to talking with friends and family.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.040]   We're gonna talk about why this is a skill
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.840]   everyone should master and learn,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.660]   what most people get wrong about how they ask questions,
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.000]   how to improve the kinds of questions you ask
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.440]   and why that's important,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   how to build rapport with people you've just met
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.040]   or don't even know anything about, and a lot more.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.640]   Andrew, thanks for being here.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.980]   Welcome to the show.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.420]   - Thanks for having me on, Chris.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.620]   - So I'm just gonna jump in.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.680]   You named the book, "Stop Asking Questions,"
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.540]   but it's really about asking better questions.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.380]   Can you talk about that?
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.900]   How did you pick that name?
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.260]   - I think that we think as interviewers
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.300]   and conversationalists that we need to ask questions.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.380]   And what I've discovered is that asking too many questions
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.120]   makes you seem needy and makes you feel
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.900]   like you're not really part of the conversation.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.560]   We should not be having question after question
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.320]   after question be our style.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.760]   Our style should be a conversation
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.280]   that brings out what we're trying to learn,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.240]   brings out what our audience needs to learn.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.680]   And I find that questions often counteracts that.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.160]   - We talk about this in a professional setting.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.800]   You and I both record a lot of podcasts,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.200]   you a lot more than me,
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.160]   but this is a skill regular people can use also, right?
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.220]   How many times do parents try to get their kids
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.700]   to just tell them about their day, talk about a problem,
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.540]   and then they pelt them with questions
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.820]   that are really challenging for kids to answer.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.180]   Frankly, sometimes even just saying,
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.180]   "What'd you do today?" is challenging.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.880]   But if they say, "I don't wanna go to school tomorrow,"
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.820]   and you say, "Because?"
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.660]   That one word will often get them to open up.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.420]   It's like these magical phrases
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.300]   that will work in any part of life.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.020]   And if you see my interviews, you see,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.240]   I will just throw in the word because,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.280]   interrupt someone sometimes, and because I've done that,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.340]   they will go into the depth and the reasons
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.920]   of what they did and why they did it.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.100]   And so that's what it's about.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.380]   Sometimes it's about asking a question, sure,
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.740]   but often it's not asking a question.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.400]   It's just a one word like transition
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.580]   that I've handed to them
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.280]   and they can't help but use to explain why.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.100]   "Why don't you wanna go to school tomorrow?"
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.220]   Is kind of challenging.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.900]   Now they're put on the spot.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.860]   They've said something and I say, "Because?"
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.460]   Now there's an expectation that they're, of course,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.080]   gonna finish the sentence,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.820]   "Because my friend doesn't like me,
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940]   "because my friend has moved on to first grade
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.180]   "and I'm still in kindergarten."
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.220]   Whatever it is, it comes out naturally.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.780]   Now, the reason that I wrote this book
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.420]   is because I found that a lot of people
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.820]   were doing interviews the way they were supposed to,
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.300]   which is I'm gonna ask the best question.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.900]   Some people would even write the questions ahead of time
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.660]   instead of being more present in the conversation
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.060]   and instead of saying,
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.880]   "What's the best way to get the most knowledge
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.820]   "out of this person who I'm talking with
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.420]   "and the best bonding?"
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.580]   And when you start with that,
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.720]   instead of how do I write the best questions,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.540]   you end up with a deeper conversation
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.660]   that often involves you sharing and not asking a question,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.900]   you making a statement, you directing the person even.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.260]   - My first use case I thought about this,
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.860]   that an average person might be preparing for an interview
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.420]   is in a job setting, right?
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.160]   I'm looking for a job, I'm going in.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.500]   I know at some point someone's gonna say,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.700]   "All right, what questions do you have for me?"
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.980]   You know, my initial advice after reading your book was,
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.160]   well, you should try to get to that point at the end
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.000]   with never having, you know,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.140]   have such a good conversation
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.660]   that you don't even leave time for the questions.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.900]   How would you advise someone thinking about
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.180]   that kind of professional setting
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.780]   where they have time to prepare?
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.100]   - Okay, let me give you one.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.520]   What questions do you have for me?
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.500]   The natural next step might be to say,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.860]   how many hours do we work here, right?
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.940]   Now you're coming across as a needy person
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.820]   trying to understand, it makes you,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.740]   it's hard for me to say this,
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.340]   but if you keep asking questions,
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.220]   you come across as an inferior.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.860]   Versus saying, now tell me about the hours at work here.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.300]   Talk a little bit about what's expected from us
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.700]   in our off hours.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.780]   Talk a little bit about how we connect to each other
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.420]   in the company instead of, so how do we connect each other?
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.000]   So what you're doing, and this is one example,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.540]   is directing the person.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.200]   Directing gives them the confidence that you can lead them,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.220]   that you could lead them through the conversation
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.460]   and also that you can lead at the job.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.300]   And so that's a good example of me saying,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.280]   shouldn't be a question.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.580]   Sometimes you just need to make a statement, take control.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.340]   In my book, "Stop Asking Questions,"
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.860]   I gave the example of how Olivia and my wife and my family
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.140]   went on these tours of national parks.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.460]   And if we would ever have a tour guide
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.620]   who would walk around and go,
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.100]   do you wanna turn right or left?
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.980]   What do you like to see?
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.700]   Do you like to see this track or that?
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.960]   It's too much.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.100]   You're the expert.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.480]   Say, and now we're gonna turn left
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.540]   because when we turn left,
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.580]   you're gonna see what the bears have done here.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.500]   And if we turn right after that,
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.660]   you're gonna see what's happened
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.700]   because we haven't had enough water here in California.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.540]   Boom, now you got somebody who knows you,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.420]   who you feel confident that they could lead you.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.180]   That's the way you need to be as an interviewer,
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.500]   as a conversationalist.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.820]   And yes, like you said, somebody is about to get a job
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.600]   and they're being asked, do you have any questions for me?
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.840]   You don't have to specifically give a question.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.300]   Start directing them.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.380]   - So if you're not asking as many questions,
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.580]   talk about how someone should prepare
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.240]   for kind of conversations when they have advanced notice
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.400]   of who they're talking about and the topic.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.860]   The best thing is to go deep.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.340]   This is gonna be a little bit woo.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.420]   Go deep in your heart and say,
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.340]   what the hell do I need to get out of this person?
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.140]   What do I need to get out of this conversation?
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.380]   Not, what does some imaginary audience member need to know
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.720]   and I need to get?
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.980]   We don't need that imaginary audience member anymore.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.160]   It's, I have a problem.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.220]   What do I want to understand from this person
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.500]   that I can't get from anywhere else?
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.580]   Go deep and say, ah, that's the thing that I need.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.460]   That's the thing that I need.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.860]   And if it's for your audience,
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.700]   the only way I think to get to your audience
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.140]   is to have a drink with your audience members
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.860]   or a meal or dinner with a few of them.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.940]   One at a time, ideally, in small groups,
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.020]   if you can do one at a time and as often as you can,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.920]   and then have them tell you their problems.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.020]   Let them find ways to get it out.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.400]   Have them tell you their problems
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.860]   and specifically the ones you can't answer.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.440]   Feel that pain of having somebody come to you
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.660]   as the expert interviewer, as the expert business person,
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.220]   as the expert whatever.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.420]   And they're asking you a question,
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.260]   you don't have the answer.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.140]   And then you say, be humble, I don't know.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.900]   I'm gonna do interviews and now I'm gonna find out.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.060]   And now when you ask that question of somebody else,
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.520]   you're gonna have a deep need to get the answer
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.500]   because you couldn't answer it.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.460]   Because somebody you cared about who you had a meal with
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.920]   or a drink with asked you a question that you can't answer.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.320]   That's where it comes from.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.920]   And so the first thing to do is not to do research
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.020]   and I believe in doing research, and I know you do too.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.980]   The first thing to do is not to write out a list
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.840]   of questions and a lot of interviewers do that.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.020]   We don't wanna do that.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.540]   The first thing is to say, what do I need?
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.660]   - I just thought of an idea of what you just said,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.620]   which is, let's say I'm using this job interview example,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.340]   but start asking, talking to your friend,
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.560]   talking to your spouse, talking to your family members
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.100]   about this job you're getting and see which questions
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.140]   that they have for you about the company
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.900]   that you can't answer and you wish you knew
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.740]   as a way to kind of--
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.380]   - That's a great one. - Generate ideas
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.140]   of what could be interesting.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.980]   - Right. - What about
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.520]   when you don't know someone?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.040]   You know, there's practicing for a conversation
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.940]   you know you're gonna have.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.700]   And then there's, I'm going to a cocktail party,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.520]   I'm going to a conference, I don't know who I'm gonna meet
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.220]   or who they're gonna be.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.260]   Is there a way to just build repetition
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.820]   or get your reps in for practicing conversational skills
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.020]   without any person that you know you're talking to?
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.100]   That make sense?
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.860]   - I absolutely do practice my question techniques in private
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.260]   when there's somebody that I meet
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.700]   and I don't think I'm ever gonna meet them again,
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.300]   I just throw out a question approach
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.720]   to see how will they respond?
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.120]   I try to direct them.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.260]   Tell me what you were doing this weekend
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.300]   instead of, so what were you doing this weekend?
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.480]   I try it and see what happens.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.220]   If I try it on someone in person and it doesn't feel awkward
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.260]   and I don't see a distance in the conversation,
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.700]   I think it's a good technique.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.080]   Keep it in my Google Doc full of techniques
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.540]   for having better conversations.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.380]   - Tell me what else is in the Google Doc, right?
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.060]   You've got starting with tell me,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.900]   you used pausing and interrupting people saying because,
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.600]   let them continue.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.700]   What other tactics work really well
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.900]   in this conversational flow?
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.500]   - The one that started the whole thing for me
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.880]   was I, for years, felt really bad
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.260]   because I asked Jason Freed, the founder of Basecamp,
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.700]   how he failed, when he failed,
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.820]   and he just kind of looked away.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.020]   I still see him right now as we're talking in my head,
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.180]   looking away and going,
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.660]   well, sometimes we just don't have any setbacks.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.600]   Some things just don't have that.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.380]   And the more I push, the more he just acted,
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.800]   or I felt that he acted like I was an idiot
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.500]   who always failed and couldn't understand
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.420]   that sometimes people don't just fall on their face
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.380]   when they're just trying to walk
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.700]   to the other end of the room.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.400]   Anyway, that ate away at me,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.020]   that I asked him about his setback
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.780]   and he didn't give me an example,
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.260]   and I kept pushing, and the more I pushed,
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.620]   the more he resisted.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.060]   So I hired an interview coach
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.900]   and I gave him that specific example.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.260]   I said, look, Jeremy, before we talk about anything else,
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.740]   I have to tell you about this one problem.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.420]   And I told him, and he goes,
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.620]   oh, my therapist had a situation like that.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.620]   Go tell him, he goes,
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.100]   my therapist had a technique called join the resistance.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.640]   Says my therapist would have these men
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.900]   who would come into her office and she would say,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.460]   okay, tell me about the problem
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.660]   you and your wife are facing.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.580]   And the husband would go, I don't have any problems.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.500]   Say, but you're clearly in here because you have a problem.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.580]   There's an issue in the relationship.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.220]   It's not me, it's her.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.140]   I don't have any problem.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.300]   He goes, then what are we doing here?
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.300]   I don't know, she made me come.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.780]   And the more the therapist pushed,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.980]   the more the person put up a resistance
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.380]   and then like sidestepped the whole problem.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.380]   So Jeremy's therapist said she decided
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.500]   to join the resistance.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.860]   If she said, tell me about the problem
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.780]   you and your wife are having.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.860]   And the person said, I'm not having any problem.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.940]   You would say, oh, must be good.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.780]   You know what?
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.260]   All I hear that people have problems.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.880]   It must be good for you to just have an easygoing life
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.620]   without any problems.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.780]   Congratulations.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.660]   And then the person would go, easy.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.460]   All she does is she keeps complaining to me.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.420]   And I don't know when we could spend time together
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.620]   because my work is now taking up a whole lot of time.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.700]   And I've never had to work this many hours,
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.060]   let alone this late in my career.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.780]   Now they were off on a conversation that mattered.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.780]   And so Jeremy, my interview coach,
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.240]   said join the resistance.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.460]   Whenever you ask a guest a question and they resist,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.260]   stop fighting with them.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.300]   Join the resistance.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.080]   Say something like, well, it must be great
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.480]   to have an easy business.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.540]   Everyone else is struggling.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.540]   It must be great to have an easy time building your company
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.860]   when the rest of us are working really hard.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.540]   When I say that, the person will immediately lash out at me
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.640]   and go, hard?
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.540]   I mean, you think this is easy?
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.380]   You don't know.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.660]   Last night we were up because the servers were down.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.340]   And then somebody a week ago was complaining to me
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.860]   about the way that we are interacting at work.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.820]   And I'm trying to get work done,
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.300]   not talk about what their interpersonal issues are.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.100]   Now we've got a real problem we can talk about.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.580]   So anyway, because the coach said join the resistance
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.740]   and he gave me that phrase,
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.700]   I wrote it down in a Google Doc with that phrase.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.660]   And I said, oh, I'm gonna remember this
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.900]   because it has a name.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.460]   And so I started to, whenever I would have a new technique,
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.300]   I would give it a name
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.320]   and I'd add that technique to a Google Doc.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.380]   - I saw the list in the book where there's like a,
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.300]   flow chart's the wrong word.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.460]   It's like a directory of tactics.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.540]   So there are plenty more for anyone listening
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.580]   who wants more than we'll get to today.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.760]   But how do you think those techniques work when you're,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.940]   you know, you talk about building yourself up,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.340]   not making yourself seem needy and asking questions
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.660]   when you're interviewing for a job,
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.180]   or maybe you're doing references
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.920]   with someone's previous manager.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.580]   Can you still use those techniques to get people
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.620]   who are kind of more guarded with information to share?
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.380]   - I use it with people all the time.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.700]   I think sometimes people are guarded because they're modest,
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.260]   because they're not jerks.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.980]   So one technique that I had, I shared this when I had,
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.480]   I used to in San Francisco have entrepreneurs come over
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.220]   for scotch at my office.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.860]   And they would just ask me all these questions
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.680]   and someone would say,
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.720]   how do you get people to give you their numbers?
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.100]   And I said, well, what I do is I give them
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.980]   a dramatic low ball.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.580]   I said, what do you mean dramatic low ball?
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.420]   I said, I had this woman on,
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.060]   she wouldn't give me her revenue number.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.700]   So I said to her, and I knew that it was in,
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.780]   it was at least 10 million.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.220]   I said to her, do you think you'll hit a million soon?
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.940]   She goes a million, we're doing at least 10, 20 times that.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.940]   We're not trying to reach a million.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.500]   Anyway, I said that at scotch night and the guy goes,
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.300]   oh, that's such a good technique.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.700]   If you go dramatic low ball, people feel insulted enough
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.780]   that they have to come back at you.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.380]   Anyway, we started talking about other things
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.140]   and when we're at scotch night at my office,
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.460]   we're tasting different scotches,
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.540]   talking about what we're into.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.160]   And at one point we got into running and the guy said,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.060]   so how much do you run?
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.920]   I said, yeah, I run as much as I can here and there.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.460]   And the guy goes, Andrew, do you think you'll get
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.680]   to run a marathon sometime maybe?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.400]   And I go, a marathon sometime?
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.500]   I've run more marathons than I can count, literally.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.340]   There was one time in Washington DC,
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.220]   my wife left me at the top of Rock Creek Park
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.580]   and I just ran all the way down.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.900]   That was over 30 miles and there was no other way
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.260]   for me to get home except to run back to the house.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.140]   So a marathon is nothing for me.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.820]   And then he was smiling and others
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.620]   around the scotch table were smiling too.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.660]   And I couldn't understand why they were laughing at me.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.380]   At first I thought maybe they were laughing at me
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.840]   because that's not that much to run.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.620]   And then I realized he used dramatic low ball on me.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.900]   And so this works everywhere.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.140]   Yes, it works in interviews.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.300]   Yes, it works in private conversations.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.080]   It absolutely does.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.360]   - Are there some examples of people you've talked to
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.680]   outside of the professional interviewing setting
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.580]   that after adopting these techniques have seen
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.480]   kind of real tangible outcomes or improvements
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.860]   in their career or their life or their relationships?
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.540]   - Yes, I was invited in when I first wrote the book
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.900]   to talk at a company.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.740]   What was it called?
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.800]   It was called people.ai.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.460]   They said, oh, we're salespeople.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.700]   We need these techniques too because salespeople,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.740]   if they do it well, what they do is they ask questions.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.000]   And so they bought a copy of my book
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.340]   for each one of their salespeople.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.860]   And then they invited me in to speak.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.060]   And then afterwards I got messages from people
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.920]   about how they use these techniques.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.200]   There's one salesperson who said,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.360]   Andrew, you want to know numbers
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.260]   because you're trying to create a podcast
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.040]   where you're revealing to your audience
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.300]   the revenue that your guest has.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.760]   Because I need numbers because I want to know
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.460]   the extent of a problem.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.140]   I want to know how much of an issue this is
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.540]   to figure out whether we can solve it or not.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.860]   Because what I do is I come in with a dramatic low ball.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.620]   I will use something like, well,
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.800]   it seems like you're maybe losing only $1,000 a month
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.580]   with this problem that you've told me about.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.420]   And the person will come in,
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.260]   no, it's more than $1,000.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.620]   And then they'll start to fight back
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.780]   and explain how this is really costing the business
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.740]   half a million a year.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   And now that the salesman knows the measurable pain
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.700]   of not solving it,
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.340]   he can address how just spending a little bit of money
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.420]   on their software can help him alleviate that pain.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.500]   And so, yeah, salespeople for sure use this.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.900]   - What about at home?
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.860]   Do you use any of these tactics with family and friends
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.320]   when it's not really, there's no business use case.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.140]   It's just trying to build deeper relationships
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.260]   with people you already know a bit about.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.100]   - I do.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.140]   I think the biggest one that I use is the word because.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.700]   So if the thing that happens in conversations
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.040]   is we say what happened.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.900]   What happened is just what, it's factual, it's interesting,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.300]   but it doesn't tell me why you're doing something,
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.260]   why it matters.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.780]   The problem is if I say, well,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.020]   tell me why you feel that way,
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.620]   or tell me why you did that.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.700]   I'm putting you in this self-evaluation mode
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.660]   that you can't really tap into in a conversation.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.900]   Even with a therapist, you have a hard time doing it.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.420]   But if you're telling me that you did this
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.260]   and you did that, and I say because,
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.740]   now I'm just handing you the next word
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.720]   for you to have to respond to.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.000]   The next, I'm almost insisting that you tell me.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.460]   I'm creating a gap that you feel you have to fill in.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.540]   If I say because, you feel like you have to pick that up
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.460]   and say, well, because I wasn't feeling very good,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.060]   because I'm feeling this way, that.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.100]   Now you understand why.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.900]   So because is an easy one to use with people.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.700]   - You say in the book,
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.900]   people prefer to be heard more than to be helped.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.260]   I know my wife would agree sometimes.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.060]   In our conversations,
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.700]   for people who have a natural tendency
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.740]   to jump in and help,
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.460]   to try to solve a problem or interject,
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.620]   are there any ways that you found helpful
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.660]   to bite your tongue effectively?
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.340]   Maybe that's literally the answer
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.500]   for people that that's not natural for?
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.380]   - I have found that I don't take advice very well
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.540]   when it comes to problems that I don't recognize
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.220]   in an environment that I feel comfortable with.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.900]   So if you were to give me advice on how I could,
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.420]   I don't know, use my Mac better,
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.460]   maybe even about my business,
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.180]   I feel like, all right, I've heard it from so many people,
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.460]   I don't need it.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.060]   But we just moved to Five Acres in Austin.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.480]   I decided that I would get a circular saw
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.620]   so that I can cut wood and make it into a compost box.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.860]   I don't freaking know how to even turn on a circular saw.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.140]   I literally didn't know how to put the blade in.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.860]   I don't know how to connect two pieces of wood together.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.540]   It turns out you have to drill a hole first
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.740]   and then put a screw into it.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.180]   And the videos I saw on YouTube,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.900]   they were just putting a screw in,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.140]   but I didn't realize there was a hole there before.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.860]   Anyway, I don't know any of it.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.100]   And so I'm ready to take advice better.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.060]   I'm ready to be more of a learner and less of a know-it-all
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.720]   who's gonna stop and interrupt you.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.820]   So what I'm getting at is,
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.140]   I think if anyone out there is in a very know-it-all place
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.260]   where they can't stop but give people answers
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.700]   and solve their problems
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.320]   instead of listening to their problems,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.700]   get out of your own comfort zone,
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.240]   get into a place where you don't know
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.500]   what you're talking about,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.620]   because there, you're just going to shut up more
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.060]   and give direction and advice less,
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.580]   and it'll build a better habit for you.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.860]   And I think that if you do that,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.820]   you're gonna be much more open to listening to people
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.160]   and less to giving them advice.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.980]   You're gonna be much more open to
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.920]   not knowing and looking for understanding.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.900]   And I think that I was blessed with Mixergy,
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.660]   my podcast of 15 years,
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.740]   in that I really started it after I failed.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.660]   The thing that made it into a podcast
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.500]   was this video that I posted where I said,
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.960]   "I was starting a software company and I failed.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.600]   "I'm going to do interviews with people
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.020]   "to learn how to not fail this way again."
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.700]   And if I've admitted to myself and the world that I failed,
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.580]   that I don't know how to do entrepreneurship
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.460]   the way that I wanted to, the way that I thought I could,
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.820]   now, when someone came to me, I couldn't give them advice.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.940]   I just admitted I don't know everything.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.060]   I had to ask questions and learn.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.520]   I had to say, "I don't know enough,
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.900]   "and that's why I'm interviewing these people.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.260]   "Let me ask them."
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.860]   And so what I would suggest is if you're talking too much,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.220]   you need to get into an environment
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.140]   where you don't know enough.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.140]   And if it's in a relationship,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.160]   and the person you're with is a better runner,
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.000]   go run with them.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.020]   If they're a better swimmer,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   go sign up for a swim with them.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.780]   If they're better at anything,
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.700]   if they're better at knitting,
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.260]   go sign up for a knitting class with them
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.320]   so that you are not the expert,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.220]   and you have to be the, "I don't know what I'm doing here.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.220]   "This seems so foreign to me."
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.420]   And you'll learn to listen,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   and you'll learn to want other people to talk.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.900]   - So back to your example of paddleboarding,
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.740]   if you're having that conversation with someone,
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.980]   and you hear something come up
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.100]   about a topic you don't know,
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.180]   and you want to try to build a more engaging conversation,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.100]   just let them run.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.680]   It might help you shut up,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.920]   which I know is something that has been effective for me
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.820]   in my career is just learning when to stop talking,
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.920]   which goes back to the title.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.740]   But let's go back to that example of productivity.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.020]   So you mentioned if I was gonna,
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.860]   if you were gonna have a conversation for an hour with me,
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.420]   or anyone, and we were just gonna talk about
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.220]   how to optimize using your Mac,
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.020]   and moving Windows around,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   which we actually just did in a episode a couple weeks ago,
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.360]   you might be like, "I just don't want to be here."
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.220]   But there are a lot of conversations that people get into
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.900]   where leaving is not the option.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   So what do you do in those circumstances?
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.540]   - I just shift it to what I really care about.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.380]   There's so many times
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.020]   when you have to really go into a conversation with people,
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.140]   and you don't care.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.900]   I think it's okay to shift the conversation
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.460]   to what you genuinely do care about.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.060]   - What if it's clear that that's what they want to talk?
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.900]   Do you give it to them?
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.660]   Do you just kind of feign and nod your head?
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.540]   Or have you found some kind of way to harness interest
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.460]   in things people are talking about
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.320]   that at first glance are just not interesting?
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.740]   - I was never able to have conversations with people.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.160]   I just didn't know the mechanics of conversations.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.100]   Then I read a book called
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.700]   "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.460]   And the big message of it is,
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.160]   take an interest in other people
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.640]   if you want them to like you.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.900]   So if they are interested in a thing,
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.180]   you talk to them about the thing.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.000]   And I was so moved by the book that I went
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.140]   and I knocked on Dale Carnegie and Associates office door.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.140]   And I said, "I want to volunteer to work for you for free
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.780]   just to see how you live these principles."
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.040]   And I learned it and I got good at it.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.480]   And then one day in college,
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.220]   I was going home with my friend, Michael,
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.840]   on the, I think it was the F train in New York.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.620]   And he started going off on these comic books
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.900]   that he was into.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.700]   What superhero he liked,
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.940]   how many of these comic books he had,
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.060]   and all of that stuff that I couldn't care less about.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.760]   I was so bored.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.740]   He loved that I was taking an interest in him.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.820]   And I would ask him questions like,
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.240]   "Well, why did you buy that one?
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.940]   And how valuable do you think it is?"
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.540]   And he loved it and I hated it.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.740]   And what I realized was,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.060]   if this is the epitome of success
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.500]   in the Dale Carnegie world, I don't want it.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.740]   I don't want a life where I'm sucked into conversations
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.940]   that don't mean anything to me,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.020]   and I'm pained by just so that other people like me.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.380]   There has to be a better way.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.800]   And what I've learned is I can shift the conversation
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.180]   to what I want it to be.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.740]   Somewhere in the Venn diagram
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.820]   between what this person loves talking about
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.880]   and what I'm really eager to hear about is an overlap.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.940]   And that's where I go.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.940]   And so today I would have asked,
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.340]   "Does your Russian father have a problem
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.100]   with you reading these comic books?"
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.860]   Because he's so serious.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.820]   And there's a whole Russian culture of literature
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.860]   that matters more than this.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.720]   And I would have gotten into his Russian experience.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.220]   I would have today asked him if he was worried
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.280]   that girls weren't into him
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.100]   because his head was in these stupid comic books
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.540]   all the time, because I was wondering about that.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.940]   I would have asked a conversation
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.160]   that related to the comic books,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.140]   but also to the thing that I cared about.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.500]   And that I think is the answer.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.420]   - I know you've read a lot of your transcripts
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.280]   to build a muscle of, "Okay, how am I doing this?
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.120]   What am I doing right?"
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.660]   You've even probably hired people to review them.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.420]   Is there a version of that conversational review
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.260]   for people not in a professional setting?
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.900]   Is it recording business meetings,
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.200]   maybe with or without consent, and listening to them?
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.240]   - No, always do it with consent.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.840]   There's no reason for us to do it without consent,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.060]   but I will tell you how you get consent
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.340]   and then what to do with it.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.540]   The way you get consent is to recognize
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.820]   that the other person doesn't care
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.380]   that you wanna study the way that you sell
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.540]   so you can sell to more people,
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.540]   or study the way that you talk
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.340]   so you can talk to more people.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.860]   The other person wants to have notes on what they're doing.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.460]   So if you're doing a coaching call,
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.540]   can I record this coaching call
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.900]   so I know what it is that I said to you that's helpful?
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.740]   (groans)
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.440]   But I've coached people on interviews and other things.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.180]   I will say, "Do you mind if I record this?
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.220]   Because I found that in the past,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.260]   people want to see what I've said
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.940]   and they don't wanna waste time writing it down."
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.740]   Ah, this is helpful.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.620]   That is 100% useful to do.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.260]   So yes, you can absolutely record
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.700]   with the other person's consent,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.220]   but give them the reason, the incentive,
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.920]   to have that call recorded.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.660]   Salespeople do this all the time.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.380]   There is this software that's used.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.960]   I'm actually gonna interview the founder of it.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.800]   What is it called?
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.960]   - Is it otter.ai?
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.920]   - No, otter.ai works for anyone.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.980]   If you need your audio something transcribed,
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.980]   they will do it.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.620]   But there is something called,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.040]   I'll have to get it for you afterwards,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.380]   you can put in the show notes,
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.260]   where what they do is they record salespeople's conversations
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.000]   so that the salesperson can have an understanding
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.580]   of what she said that helped close the sale.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.840]   And then AI will go through and analyze.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.740]   The thing is that outside of sales and interviewing,
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.260]   there just aren't enough people
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.240]   who care about conversations to do anything with it.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.740]   Too many people think conversations
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.840]   are just a thing you do
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.500]   instead of a thing you study to do well.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.220]   You would never find people who are serious swimmers
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.900]   just hoping to go in the pool
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.420]   and figure out the way that they're supposed to swim.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.360]   You would never find serious chess players
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.300]   saying I'm just gonna wing playing chess.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.020]   They study it, they learn it.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.100]   And I think a lot of us go into conversations saying,
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.820]   I'll just work on it and be better at it
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.620]   instead of studying the way they played before
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.180]   and then seeing what they could do better.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.740]   By the way, that software is called Wingman by Clary now.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.380]   So if you go to trywingman.com,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.520]   or salespeople know about this, I don't need to tell them,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.940]   it will record their calls
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.920]   and then give them feedback on it.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.180]   - Do you think someone could benefit in a situation
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.820]   where they don't feel comfortable asking
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.580]   or can't get permission?
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.020]   Is it debriefing in some particular way right after
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.300]   and taking notes or collecting feedback
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.060]   from the people you're speaking with?
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.460]   Let's take the job interview example.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.500]   I imagine if you said, hey, could we interview my,
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.720]   or could I record my interview with you?
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.180]   I could imagine a lot of companies being like, no,
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.660]   we don't let people record our job interviews.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.120]   But you wanna get, I mean, it's a skill
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.620]   that I think a lot of people looking for jobs right now
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.600]   wish that they could review and see how they did.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.060]   Is it notes after, is it asking feedback?
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.840]   - I think that studying it afterwards is a problem.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.040]   I mean, without a recording, and here's why.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.800]   I had this one interview that I brought back to my coach
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.480]   and I said, look at this, I'm such a wuss in these calls.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.320]   That's what he mean.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.540]   I said, look, all the people that I admire,
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.120]   remember at the time I told him Ramit Sethi
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.100]   is a great blogger.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.200]   He keeps talking about how great he is at saving money,
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.480]   how great he is at handling hot sauce in his mouth.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.400]   Like he talks about how great he is.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.540]   And that's what people want.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.860]   When they're reading these posts,
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.880]   they wanna see someone who loves themselves enough
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.060]   to talk about how great they are
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.840]   so that as readers, as followers of this person,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.640]   they could wanna be that great too
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.440]   and be that happy with themselves.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.080]   And what do I do as an interviewer
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.380]   is I talk about the things that aren't working for me,
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.860]   how I don't understand how I can systemize my business,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.560]   how I don't understand how I can hire better.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.800]   I keep talking about my problems
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.680]   and then the guest talks about all their wins.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.440]   And look at this, I said in the transcript.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.680]   And my coach looked at the transcript
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.440]   and he just stopped talking to me.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.720]   This guy thinks that this question is not serious enough
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.240]   to take a look at or to consider.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   He's just kind of off in his own world.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.160]   I just sat there feeling more miserable.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.440]   And then Jeremy says, "Andrew, I think he said something
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.220]   "like double click on my face, which in Google Docs
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.280]   "means you could scroll to where the person is."
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.400]   He goes, "Look, this is what you're talking about?"
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.000]   I go, "Yes, look at how I put myself down there
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.480]   "by saying what I don't know."
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.180]   He goes, "Now look at this, double click on my face again."
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.020]   I double click.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.320]   He took me down further in the transcript and he said,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.700]   "She now is being open about her problem with her mom
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.480]   "and how it led her to where she is
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.320]   "and to be the kind of person she is."
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.940]   He said, "You are thinking you're gonna get vulnerable
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.400]   "and the other person will immediately be vulnerable back.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.640]   "And when they don't, you feel like you're alone
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.320]   "in your weakness and everybody else is a success.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.480]   "What you don't realize is you start out
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.000]   "with this vulnerability, the person needs to process it.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.040]   "And eventually they often feel comfortable sharing
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.160]   "and look at how it is in black and white."
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.480]   So when we're trying to find,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.720]   the reason I'm saying this to you,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.240]   when we're trying to find non-obvious wins
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.920]   and losses in our conversations,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.200]   it's really hard for us to evaluate ourselves.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   We just can't do it.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.680]   That's why when you see a standup comic perform,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.800]   you'll often see that they're recording themselves
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.000]   because they might think that a joke bombed,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.880]   but in reality, there was a hint of a laugh
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.720]   that they didn't realize
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.040]   because they were feeling vulnerable
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.680]   and insecure about that joke.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.440]   They need to see it afterwards,
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.980]   not when they're in performance mode,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.720]   but when they're in evaluation mode.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.520]   In performance mode, you are much harder on yourself.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.400]   In evaluation mode, you can go much more cerebral.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.440]   So coming back to the job interview,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.280]   I would suggest to you that there are a lot of people
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.320]   who could say, "I wanna record this conversation
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.160]   "so that I have notes for how to follow up on this.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.020]   "What I've discovered is that you're gonna teach me a lot
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.080]   "about your company.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.440]   "And if I start to write it down because I wanna learn it,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.960]   "I'm not gonna have it afterwards.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.440]   "But if I record it and I give both of us notes on it,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.720]   "I'm gonna have something that I could follow up on."
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.800]   I would suggest to you that something like that
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.860]   is really helpful for people to say,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.520]   "I'm gonna record what we're doing
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.960]   "because I've found that a lot of people,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.200]   "when they do interviews with me,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.320]   "aren't aware of," or whatever.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.220]   Maybe sometimes, "I don't express everything right
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.700]   "and I wanna fact-check it for you.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.100]   "So if I have a recording, I can go back
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.200]   "and I could look at it."
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.420]   Give them the wind, tell them why it's important,
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.200]   and people will be willing to do it.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.140]   Now, if that's not an option,
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.240]   I should tell you that one thing that I've done
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.960]   is I will record my side of the conversation.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.960]   I don't need the other person necessarily.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   I can just say, "I'm recording this
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.540]   "so that I have my own voice."
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.800]   And I think that helps.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.640]   It's not ideal.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.280]   I prefer to see both, but I think there's a way.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.840]   - Two follow-ups was one, if you're doing that,
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.200]   also make it clear that you're not gonna be
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.160]   doing anything with the audio.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.400]   You're not gonna be sharing the audio publicly.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.640]   It might seem obvious, but I think that's something to add.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.200]   And the other, I was thinking, "Gosh,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.600]   "how would you just record one person?"
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.620]   Then I was just thinking right now,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.760]   "Oh, I have headphones on.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.720]   "If I had my iPhone right now recording this room."
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.320]   So if you're doing a Zoom call, throw some headphones on.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.500]   If you're watching this on the YouTube channel,
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.100]   you can see that Andrew has headphones on
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.420]   and doesn't look like it.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.900]   I have headphones on and look like it.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.840]   So he's got the better headphone setup here
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.220]   from discreteness, but I think those are both great.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.260]   - Chris, there's one other thing
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.620]   that I think is worth noticing.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.480]   When I started Mixergy, I was in Southern California.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.660]   Southern California, Santa Monica, even Santa Barbara,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.560]   that little stretch has venture capitalists,
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.220]   but the elite venture capitalists
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.820]   were always in San Francisco,
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.940]   and it was just a short ride away,
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.900]   so many entrepreneurs go there.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.020]   What I noticed having dinner with entrepreneurs
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.060]   is they would often go and have meetings
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.220]   with the local VCs, the locals who are newer,
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.980]   less likely to give them money,
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.500]   less likely to be the ones
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.380]   that they wanted to take money from.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.300]   And around the table, when someone would say,
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.320]   "Why did you take a meeting with this person
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.260]   "instead of going up to San Francisco?"
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.340]   Sometimes the response would be, "I needed the practice.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.480]   "I wanted somebody who was going to question me.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.360]   "I wanted to get my story right,"
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.340]   and they would practice with them.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.340]   And the reason I bring this up
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.640]   is because if you're trying to improve your conversations,
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.020]   if you're trying to improve the way you do job interviews,
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.440]   you can go out for practice
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.400]   with people who you're not as concerned about.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.800]   Maybe there's a third-tier job that you are thinking about
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.120]   or you would never even consider.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.040]   Go take the interview
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.160]   and then try some of the techniques that I'm suggesting.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.400]   Try some of the conversation techniques.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.020]   Try to ask them to record.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.260]   Get comfortable with it.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.100]   You're in some ways going to feel superior,
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.380]   and you'll say in yourself,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.400]   "I deserve to be able to record this.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.380]   "Of course, this makes sense.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.180]   "I'm gonna record it so I can follow up with them."
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.220]   And then you'll feel better about it.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.060]   Once you do it there,
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.200]   you're gonna feel better about doing it somewhere else.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.740]   So I think that's a huge, huge win.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.480]   - It kinda makes me wanna go to a networking event
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.620]   for something that I have no professional designations for.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.540]   Like, let's go to the veterinary networking event
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.300]   in the Bay Area and just go talk to people
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.940]   in a totally different industry.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.580]   Obviously, I won't be the expert.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.900]   I gotta go find out where they are.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.160]   If we rewind, you were talking about vulnerability,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.600]   but I don't think you unlocked why it can be so valuable.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.560]   So I'm gonna give you a little bit of your,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.920]   vulnerability can be an awesome skill in conversations
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.800]   because, and I'll let you finish that.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.880]   - First of all, I think we get a benefit
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.080]   in talking about it to see that it's okay to say
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.160]   that my family had some mental health issues
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.280]   or someone in our family did
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.340]   and how it just really wrecked the family
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.600]   to know that somebody's going through that.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.240]   That's a share that, you can see my voice is still not,
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.440]   you can still hear my voice,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.160]   how I'm not really comfortable talking about it.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.120]   But by sharing it, by talking about it,
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.280]   I release some of the pain that I have around it.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.160]   I also connect with other people who are having it.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.480]   And then it gives the other person an opportunity to say,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.920]   oh, it's safe to say this,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   to talk about their suicide attempt in their family,
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.760]   their mental health issues.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.480]   So I think if we really wanna get to know the other person,
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.800]   we have to show them some of ours.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.080]   Otherwise people won't do it.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.200]   They'll feel like you're taking advantage of them.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.880]   - I talk a lot about money on the show
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.960]   and I find that money is one of those places
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.440]   where people are very guarded.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.400]   People don't talk about it.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.880]   So I often just open up and just say,
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.640]   oh, here's how much we spent on this thing
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.320]   or here's this situation.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.680]   And that helps.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.400]   Another tactic that I picked up from you
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.800]   was asking them permission
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.400]   to ask them the uncomfortable question.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.240]   - Yeah.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.560]   - I think the way you frame it in the book,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.440]   and tell me if I'm correct,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.920]   is it okay if I ask you, which is two questions in one.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   - Right.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.400]   And people will answer the easiest of the two questions.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.720]   Whenever there are two questions,
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.200]   they will immediately go and take the easy answer.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.240]   So is it okay if I ask you
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.600]   if you and your wife are still married?
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.440]   If they don't feel comfortable saying
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.960]   that they're not married,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.440]   they will say yes.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.520]   They'll say, no, it's not okay.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.160]   Or no, I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.320]   You just ask them that question.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.000]   Is it okay if I ask you?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.760]   Is it okay if I ask you what your revenue is?
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.440]   Do you feel comfortable revealing your revenue?
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.760]   Those types of things are giving the other person
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.840]   an opportunity to take a graceful exit.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.040]   And I've seen this used by other interviewers
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.240]   and I have transcripts of myself using it.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.080]   And you will see that people will reveal things
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.320]   that you didn't expect
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.920]   because you've created that environment
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.360]   where they get to choose whether they answer or not.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.800]   And you'll also, if you see my transcripts,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.840]   see that some people will say,
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   no, I don't feel comfortable answering that.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.680]   You've asked me, I'll ask,
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.800]   do you feel comfortable talking about your revenue?
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.640]   And they'll say, no,
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.040]   I don't feel comfortable talking about that.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.880]   And we can move on.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.080]   And there isn't that awkwardness in the middle.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.000]   - So I did this mistakenly on an episode
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.640]   that will have by the time this airs,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.960]   already come out where I was asking Adam Levin,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.360]   who runs a podcast called What The Hack.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.000]   And it's all about cybersecurity
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.360]   and fraud and identity theft.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.760]   And I wanted specific recommendations
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.080]   for places to go to monitor your identity and credit
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.040]   because there's just so many sites I didn't trust him.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.640]   And at first answer, I asked him and he said,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.120]   I don't like to give recommendations.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.000]   And then later in the conversation,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.760]   I said something like, okay, well then who should we avoid?
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.440]   Like, if you don't wanna tell me who to pick,
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.160]   who should we avoid?
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.440]   And that broke him down.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.880]   And he said, you know what?
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.040]   I said, I don't like to do this,
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.800]   but these three guys are really good.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.200]   You should check these out.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.480]   And so I'm curious if I had said,
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.640]   is it okay if I ask you to recommend a few companies
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   that you think are really good?
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.360]   His answer would have been no.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.760]   Eventually I found out that he was willing to share more.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.160]   Are there any ways to get a sense of
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.560]   whether you've gotten someone to open up
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.160]   and revisit something that you thought
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.880]   might've been off topic or not off topic,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.440]   but you thought might've been,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.640]   you know, they weren't willing to share, but might be now?
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.440]   - The thing that I think about when you say that is
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.920]   I would write that down.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   I would analyze why that question worked,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.400]   write it down and then try it again.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.760]   And then if it works, add it to the repertoire.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.840]   I think that's an interesting approach.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.480]   You've asked him a tough question, he didn't answer it.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.720]   And then you ask him an even tougher question
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.960]   and suddenly the first one seems easy.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.720]   And so he might come in, that might be why it works.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.200]   So I would try it in conversations in private
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.560]   to see if that worked.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.720]   And if it didn't, then I discarded.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.440]   If it does, it goes on to a Google talk for me
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.920]   and that's what I use.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.000]   I think that that's important to analyze.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.040]   You're asking me if there are other ways to get at it.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.400]   I think that one way to get at it is to say,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.000]   I don't need the exact, I need a ballpark.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   So if I try to ask someone what their revenue is
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.600]   and they don't feel comfortable, I'll say,
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.140]   you feel comfortable giving me a ballpark?
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.040]   Like, is it millions?
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.880]   Is it tens of millions?
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.800]   Is it thousands?
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.960]   Okay, sometimes people will say,
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.280]   okay, I feel comfortable with the ballpark,
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.960]   I just don't want you to get the exact number.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.680]   Right, sometimes I hit them with the dramatic low ball.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.880]   Sometimes, so might, if in your situation,
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.540]   my approach might've been to say,
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.360]   if I asked him which three companies I should work with
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.360]   and he didn't give me the answer,
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   my way would have been to suggest a really bad one.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.440]   Oh, you wanna get, and then I give him
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.280]   some clearly bad example and have him go,
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.120]   no, are you kidding me?
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.380]   That's absolutely the worst company.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.340]   If you want someone, just go at least use this other company
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.220]   and then that approach would work.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.740]   So there are a few different ways,
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.020]   but I think the bigger point here
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.340]   is you've just discovered a new approach to asking question
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.860]   and I would keep an eye on that
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.140]   and see if you can use it multiple times.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.980]   And that's the way that I added to my repertoire.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.900]   This whole book was written on me discovering
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:16.180]   these ways of asking questions that worked
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.300]   and then writing them down.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   I would always give them a name,
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.140]   I would write them down,
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.820]   and then I would copy out of the transcript why they worked.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.740]   - I have another one I'll add to my repertoire,
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.420]   but I don't, I'm not gonna share it now.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.700]   I gotta go test it first.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.180]   And then, so if you're listening,
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.820]   maybe you'll hear me bring it up some more.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.820]   What about, we talked a lot about the questions you ask,
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.600]   the questions you don't ask, the ways you interrupt.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.540]   What about at the end?
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.100]   Is there anything about how you build a relationship
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.940]   and then follow up on that relationship,
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.860]   whether it's wrapping up the conversation
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.660]   or following up after that you think has helped?
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.400]   - Oh, Chris, I've been so bad at that.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.380]   Like, I will meet these amazing people,
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.980]   we'll have phenomenal conversations,
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.820]   and then I won't do anything about it.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.460]   And then we're gone from each other's lives
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.460]   after the person loves me.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.540]   Or at least we connected.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.700]   I love chess.com, I am on it all the time,
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.920]   I keep analyzing my chess game.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.420]   I interviewed the founder of chess.com,
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.820]   we hit it off, he was texting me questions like,
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.380]   "Can we buy an ad on your podcast?"
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.120]   I said, "I'm sorry, I've run out of space."
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.500]   Anyway, when we were into that kind of a thing,
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.420]   we chatted and then the whole thing disappeared.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.720]   I happened to be in therapy recently.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.680]   And one of the things that I uncovered was
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   that I am not a great stay-in-touch-with-someone person.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.600]   Like, even the people that I work with,
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.880]   with my producer, Ari DiCermo,
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.960]   we've worked together for a decade,
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.080]   I think, somewhere around there.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.200]   And I won't just say, "Here's what I'm up to,"
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.960]   or check in and see how's it going with the kids,
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.520]   or anything like that.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.920]   And he said, "Andrew, people wanna hear from you."
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.660]   I go, "Ah, they don't."
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.580]   I said, "All right, I'm gonna try it."
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.500]   He goes, "I wanna hear from you."
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.340]   I go, "Okay, I'm gonna try it.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.160]   "You're my therapist.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.000]   "You're saying I should hear from you.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.140]   "I have your number because we do this on FaceTime."
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.540]   And when I discovered something
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.300]   like how to drive a lawnmower here in Austin,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.380]   I've never mowed a lawn before I moved to Austin,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.540]   I've always been a city person.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.980]   So I discovered how to drive a driving lawnmower
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.820]   and how to change a blade.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.820]   I sent him a picture.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.660]   I saw that he got excited about it
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.820]   and I kinda like that touch point.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.580]   So then I started doing that with other people.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.700]   I would just send them a picture
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.300]   of the thing that I've learned to do.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.000]   And it might be some random thing like,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.040]   "Hey, I just got this guitar
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.580]   "that I've been traveling to Europe with.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.420]   "It's kinda fun.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.840]   "What are you up to, by the way?"
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.200]   And these little experiences
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.720]   that I'm sending in just a picture, nothing more,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.500]   they're super personal and they're an easy way to connect.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.360]   And I wish I'd done it more.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.720]   And so if I were to answer your question,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.520]   honestly, it would be I sucked at it for years.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.800]   I'm getting better at it.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.720]   And my solution is to not try to find
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.200]   more work-related things to say to someone,
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.460]   but to instead just find a few personal things
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.540]   and share it with them.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.940]   And one of the producers at Mixergy that I've had,
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.280]   like the first one, Jeremy Weiss, is amazing with it.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.140]   He will send me holiday text messages.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.040]   He'll send me random text messages
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.600]   about the date night he had with his wife.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.440]   And at times it feels like,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.060]   "Oh, I don't care about where you and your wife went."
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.060]   But I never am bothered by it
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.220]   because we're kinda staying in each other's lives
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.600]   and it's incredibly, incredibly effective.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.100]   So that's the one thing that I've learned to do.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.300]   And if I were to just add one other thing
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.700]   that's a little less harsh on myself,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.840]   but recognizing one thing that I randomly have done
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.780]   that works is I still have the same email inbox from forever.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.660]   And if I've ever interviewed somebody,
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.420]   our initial conversation is in that inbox.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.460]   So the founder of Dropbox, I have the first message
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.500]   where he said, "Yeah, I'll do the interview with you."
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.860]   Airbnb, and then other people who you may not know,
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.460]   but who matter to me.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.940]   If I need to reach out to them,
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.500]   I hit reply on that old message.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.060]   It gives them a sense of who we are
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.900]   and then it's easier to reconnect.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.180]   I'm not just somebody who needs something from you now.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.060]   I've connected with you.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.040]   I've helped you before through this podcast.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.460]   Now I'm checking in or asking for something.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.740]   - I don't know if you know Nick Gray,
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.660]   who's a fellow Austin local,
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.980]   but he creates a friends newsletter,
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.000]   which I've done in the past,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.120]   which is like a scalable version of your lawnmower example,
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.040]   which is, you know, he sends an email out.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.180]   I think now it's weekly, but you could do it once a month.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.620]   It's just kind of like, "Hey, here's what's up in my life."
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.920]   And I've actually noticed that all the hacks newsletter
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.800]   that I ship out every month, just last week,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.100]   someone who I went to college with
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.020]   and haven't talked to in forever,
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.560]   but because I merged it from an email list I had before,
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.720]   wrote back and said, "Oh my gosh,
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.540]   I've been staying in touch with you for all this long.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.380]   This is what I'm up to."
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.900]   And it kind of brought us back together.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.680]   So, you know, I would have never thought
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.980]   to text that person a picture of something,
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.240]   but to put them on an email that I send to everyone,
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.880]   I did do, and it worked.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.380]   So I said at the beginning,
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.540]   I wasn't gonna spend too much time
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.060]   focused on just professional interviewing and all that,
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.800]   because most people listening,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.520]   this is not a podcast for podcasters,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.800]   but I know the listeners of this show
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.020]   have a pretty vested interest
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.420]   in the continuing evolution of this show.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.800]   So I am curious to get your take on a few things.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.900]   You've done over 2,000 episodes
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.060]   and built a pretty big community around it.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:08.020]   How do you engage your listeners,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.940]   or advice for me to engage people listening today
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.220]   in the process of finding, recruiting,
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.240]   and kind of preparing for guests,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.540]   and kind of make it something
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.940]   that more people are involved in
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.600]   than just me and then publishing?
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.080]   I think podcasting's such a one-way experience in many ways.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.100]   It's like, maybe you can email or review,
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.260]   but I feel like there's more opportunity there.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.420]   - I was just at a conference that Nathan Lotka put on.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.320]   He asked me to go and introduce the speaker,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.320]   and then he introduced me before I introduced the speaker,
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.580]   and he said, "Andrew once gave his cell phone number
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.360]   "out on his podcast."
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.540]   I said, "There's no way that's really Andrew's number."
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.080]   So I called it.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.700]   He goes, "I called it, and it was Andrew,
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.160]   "and he picked up, and I was in college,
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.940]   "and we talked, and I said,
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.700]   "that is an amazing thing that he would actually do it."
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.540]   And he said, "We've stayed in touch since then,
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.580]   "and it's been about 10 years now."
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.640]   And the reason that I say that is,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.100]   I think we think a lot about how do we talk
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.460]   and engage our whole audience en masse.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.040]   And what I've discovered is that
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.340]   if we can just talk to them one-on-one,
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.100]   that's where the real value is.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.100]   The big thing I wouldn't get rid of,
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:22.780]   I absolutely need the broad reach,
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.820]   but the more one-on-one that I could do,
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.940]   the better, without killing myself.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.660]   The more in-person that I can do,
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.060]   or I spend time with you in the same room,
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.660]   and we have a personal conversation, the better.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.400]   So Scotchnight was a good way.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:41.460]   To make my cell phone available was a good way.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.140]   To say, "Here's my email address,
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.820]   "and anyone can reach out to me,"
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.420]   and then respond to people is a good way
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.660]   of reaching out to them.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.980]   The problem people come up with is,
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.560]   "What if too many people reach out to me?"
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.800]   And that's a definite problem,
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.780]   and I've run into that over the years.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.820]   But if you care about the people you're reaching,
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.500]   it's worth it, and if you don't,
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.700]   then you have a real problem.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.700]   I could never be some of these YouTube stars
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.440]   who are writing about how to use, I don't know,
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.940]   just any random thing.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.980]   I need to care about the people who are out there
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.020]   enough that I would wanna spend time with them,
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.180]   not enough to just make a profit off of them.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.940]   And once I do that, then I want them to reach out to me.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.980]   I may not give my cell phone out anymore,
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.820]   but I'll get my email address out and respond,
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.200]   and if I see someone on the street,
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.140]   I'll stop and we'll say hi,
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.860]   and I think that's the best answer,
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.420]   to reach an audience you genuinely care about,
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.260]   and not just one that you need more of,
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.100]   and be as open to personal one-on-one conversations
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.820]   and in-person meetings as you possibly can.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.620]   - Yeah, I think anyone listening who's emailed me
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.780]   knows that I would like to assume
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.920]   that all of them have gotten a reply,
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.660]   and as the show grows, maybe that reply is taken longer,
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.540]   but often it starts with a question,
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.300]   and then sometimes I follow up with a conversation,
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.100]   trying to understand what do you think of the show,
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.700]   what direction would you wanna take it?
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.220]   So keep those emails coming,
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.860]   even if you don't have a question,
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.780]   feel free, even if you don't have a question,
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.000]   feel free to reach out and let me know what you think
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.360]   about the show, where it should go, other things like that.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.240]   I'm always looking to improve and adapt.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.500]   - You know what, can I add to that and say,
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.820]   I think it's important that people also take that part of it
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.260]   that we keep talking about how we,
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.540]   if we get inbound respond,
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.700]   we should be responding to as many people as possible.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   I think people should also send out
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.220]   as many messages as possible.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:42.740]   There's this entrepreneur who I've invested in, Matt.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:49.020]   Matt reached out to the real founder of Netflix,
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.840]   Mark Randolph, and he got a fricking response back.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.080]   And then Mark Randolph became his advisor.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.160]   And then in the book that talks about the story
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.640]   of how Netflix was really founded by Mark Randolph,
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.240]   there's a reference to Matt in the fricking book.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.740]   And then I asked Matt, did you really like,
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.600]   is Matt, I mean, sorry, I asked Mark Randolph,
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.860]   the founder of Netflix, I said,
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.960]   is Matt Morales really like, how do you connect with him?
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.520]   Is he someone who you really are advising over the years?
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.840]   He said, yeah, he just reached out to me
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.000]   and I care about entrepreneurs.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.040]   I responded back to him.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.440]   And in fact, I invested in his latest business, Oasis,
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.720]   and he's a good person.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.520]   I go, from one fricking email out of the blue.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.480]   I think people are too intimidated to reach out
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.360]   and it's a problem.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.880]   We should also be reaching out to strangers
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.640]   whose work we like on the internet
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.760]   and tell them why we like it,
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.760]   because they're trying to establish a relationship
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.000]   with their audience too and with people they care about.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.680]   - I found that from the case of reaching out to people.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.800]   I just sent you a DM and said, hey, like your work,
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.320]   can we have this conversation?
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.000]   I've sent those DMs to other people.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.760]   Some of them say no, some of them say yes.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.080]   I think I found recruiting people to come on the show,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.440]   trying to get interesting people to talk to,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.160]   half the time it's just about, it's a numbers game, right?
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.700]   You just have to send out enough messages
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.880]   that you can get someone on the time
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.920]   that they're looking at their email,
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.160]   on the week they're not too busy.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.680]   And I think people should also be just trying more
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.840]   to get in front of people.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.960]   Also, a no is good.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.000]   A no is good, you've stayed in touch with them.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.700]   I started Mixergy by organizing events.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.640]   I would go and invite people to an event
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.960]   who wouldn't show up, but nobody said,
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.360]   that jerk Andrew invited me to an event.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.560]   Instead they go, that's the guy who invited me to an event.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.720]   I better stay nice with him
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.320]   because maybe the next time he invites me,
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.260]   it'll be to an event that I care about.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.240]   If you invite someone to do an interview,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.480]   there's nobody who goes, that jerk Chris
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.960]   invited me to do a podcast interview.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.560]   Eh, he cares about me.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.320]   No, just inviting people, even if they say no,
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.400]   it's a sincere way of saying, I care about you.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.920]   I'm here reaching out to you
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.600]   before I really even need something.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.900]   I'm inviting you to do this thing,
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.080]   to get exposure for your book in this case,
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.380]   to get exposure for your business
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.160]   in the case of me asking somebody
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.560]   to do an interview with me.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.820]   It's never a loss to just invite somebody.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.640]   And you talk about Nick Gray.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.200]   He's organizing events all over Austin.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.760]   He's constantly inviting people
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.040]   and people can't make it out,
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.740]   but he's got this reputation now
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.080]   for inviting people to events
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.520]   that creates a warm feeling.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.960]   He and the fricking guy, I moved to Austin.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.640]   He invites me to go paddle boarding.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.480]   Now that I think about it,
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.080]   I must've done stand-up paddle boarding with him.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.320]   That was my first time.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.640]   He invites me out stand-up paddle boarding.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.440]   While we're there, he goes, you know, Andrew,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.320]   if you and your wife wanna just go and experience Austin,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.640]   there's nothing like a paddle board together.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.040]   Just come on over, borrow my stand-up paddle board
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.180]   and you and Olivia can go out, you'll love it.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.080]   I've never taken him up on it
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.460]   because with paddle board rentals all over Austin,
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.260]   why do I need to go to his house and do it?
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.720]   With paddle boards costing, what, 250 bucks?
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.340]   I don't need to use his for free
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.480]   and then worry about damaging it.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.280]   But dude, the fact that he invited me to use it
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.320]   make me feel that he is a caring person
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   who is offering me something that's that personal.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.880]   Never a bad idea to invite people.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.120]   - I sent in the email before and I know we're at time,
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.160]   so I'm gonna try to wrap.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.260]   If you had a chance to listen to any episodes
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.760]   to give feedback, I don't know if you did
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.160]   'cause that was only a day or two ago,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.840]   but if you did, I'm gonna ask you about it.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.280]   - I'm gonna say that one thing that I wish I'd said
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.440]   in the beginning of this interview is let's restart.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.960]   Let's restart the computer.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.200]   We have frozen, I'll give you feedback on this one.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.720]   I dig you so much.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.560]   Our videos have frozen so much
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.840]   that I can't see the look in your face when I'm responding.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.720]   Like right now it's completely frozen
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.520]   and I don't know whether we're on the right track or not.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.800]   And so the feedback I would give is maybe to both of us
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   that when the technology is not cooperating,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.120]   to not say, ah, we've got a recording of it on Riverside,
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.280]   it's gonna record for both of us,
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.640]   but to say, let's take a moment.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   We're gonna restart it, it's gonna be valuable.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.760]   And I'm gonna take that for myself.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.000]   Sometimes as an interviewer, I think,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.400]   all right, I don't wanna bother this person
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.800]   by saying let's both restart
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.740]   or let's figure out what's going on with this.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.500]   Let's just go into the interview.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.920]   It matters, we wanna be able to see each other, right?
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.960]   If you and I were talking to each other through glass
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.080]   for whatever freaking reason
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.160]   and there was all kinds of dirt on the glass,
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.560]   I'd wanna at least wipe it down so I could see your face.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.320]   Your video, surprisingly, has been perfect the entire time.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.640]   So I didn't know. - I'm good, okay.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.760]   - Okay, this has been fantastic.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.600]   I feel like I have a lot of homework
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.180]   so that the next time I'm interviewing someone,
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.240]   I'm doing a better job, I'm asking the right questions,
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.840]   I'm pausing, I'm interrupting and everything.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.680]   So thank you.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.420]   Hopefully everyone listening will thank you
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.240]   as the quality of the show goes up
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.160]   and the quality of my skills do.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.960]   I'm excited to engage with the audience more.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.920]   So if you're listening, reach out anytime.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.640]   Andrew, where can people find out what you're up to
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   and everything you're working on?
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.480]   - If you Google me, I'm totally Googleable.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.440]   Sorry to every other Andrew Warner on the planet,
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.080]   but I got there first.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.280]   Number two, the podcast,
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.440]   if they're curious about how I do my interviews,
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.320]   it's called "Mixergy and the Book."
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.480]   Stop asking questions.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.640]   Available at libraries and bookstores.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.680]   - Ooh, never heard the plug for libraries,
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.840]   though I appreciate that.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.360]   Everyone that listening knows library extension
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.360]   to take advantage of their library as well.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.520]   - Oh dude, Chris, Libby app is amazing for that.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.040]   There's so many books that I would never think to buy,
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.120]   wouldn't even think to get the chapter to download.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.560]   Then I use the Libby app
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.040]   and I get the book directly sent to my Kindle
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.160]   and then the audio book directly on my phone to listen to.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.800]   And now, because it's just,
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.120]   you don't think about the price,
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.080]   you're just kind of experimenting,
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.680]   I might take a few and start reading books
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.960]   that I never would have before.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.120]   - You know about library extension?
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:31.960]   - No, what's library extension?
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   - So for everyone listening, library extension.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.520]   So Libby is like 30% of library extension,
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.280]   but library extension is a Chrome extension
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.880]   that when you're on Amazon looking at a book,
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.840]   it just pops up and says,
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.360]   "Hey, you can get this at any of these local libraries."
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.480]   And if you live in a metro area,
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.120]   or, you know, I have my San Francisco library card
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.920]   and I've got my San Mateo, you know,
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.240]   Burlingame library card.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.880]   And in order to join Stanford Federal Credit Union,
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.960]   I had to join the Friends of the Palo Alto library.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.640]   So like, I have a couple of library memberships
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.240]   and it just searches all of them
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.800]   from any Amazon page for a book.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.920]   So there's a little hack for everyone on the way out.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.400]   Andrew, thank you so much for being here.
