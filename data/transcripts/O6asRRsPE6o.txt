[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780]   I read to you once more the words that are engaging our attention at the present time,
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:17.000]   the words found in Paul's epistle to the Romans, chapter 8, verses 28, 29, and 30.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.640]   And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.520]   are the called according to his purpose.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:36.000]   For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.720]   he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.960]   Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.200]   Now here we are looking at what is called the doctrine of the final perseverance of
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   the saints.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.760]   That's really the matter that is before us.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.760]   I keep on emphasizing that and reminding you of that because some people seem to think
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   that what we are taught here is the doctrine of election and predestination.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.240]   Well of course we are taught them, but they're only parts in something bigger, something
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.040]   greater.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   The whole object of this statement is to give us a final certainty and assurance of our
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960]   ultimate glorification.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680]   That's what he's setting out to prove.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.400]   That is why he says that all things, doesn't matter what they are, it's literally everything,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.440]   work together for good.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.880]   Then not automatically, but they're made to work together for good, by God himself, for
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120]   those who love him.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.360]   These who are, are called according to his purpose.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.800]   For nobody would ever love him unless they were called.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.320]   And they'd never be called unless they were a part of his great and eternal purpose.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   And the purpose is that we might be conformed to the image of his Son.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.000]   So what the apostle is telling us is just that, that because we are in this purpose
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.480]   of God, nothing can prevent our arriving at that complete, final, perfect salvation, which
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.840]   is conformity to the image of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.800]   Now then, all these other things are steps in that great, ultimate objective.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   Now we've been dealing with this positively, and at the moment we're dealing with difficulties
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.800]   that many people get with respect to the doctrine.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   That's all right.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.440]   There must be difficulties with such a glorious doctrine.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.640]   All high doctrine of necessity is difficult.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.600]   And in any case, there is always an adversary who is ready to suggest difficulties and to
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.640]   get us into a state of muddle.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.760]   So one of the functions of preaching and of teaching is to deal with the difficulties.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.160]   I'm not here just to give a positive exposition.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.580]   I'm here to try to help people to understand it and to grasp it, that they may enjoy the
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.200]   full benefits of this most wonderful, and in many ways the most glorious of all the
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.880]   doctrines looked at from the standpoint of our salvation and our enjoyment of it.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.480]   Now we've seen that there are many passages that cause people to stumble with respect
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.000]   to this doctrine.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I've suggested you can classify them into three main groups.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Those that seem to say quite explicitly that one can fall away.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.240]   Secondly, those who seem to say that our salvation is doubtful and depends ultimately upon us
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.200]   and what we do.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.120]   And then into the third category we put the so-called famous warning passages, which do
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.360]   merit a category and a classification on their own.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.400]   Well now, we are trying to deal with some of these passages, only picking out some of
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.600]   the more important ones, because we haven't time to go into them all in detail.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.760]   And I've been suggesting that there are certain canons of interpretation, principles, by which
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.160]   we should meet these difficult statements.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:34.440]   Now we've dealt with a number, but we come tonight to the famous warning passages themselves.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.680]   And these, of course, above all others, are the ones that cause people to stumble.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.560]   I've always noticed that when people write books against this doctrine, what they always
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.000]   fall back upon is the warning passages.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.080]   I referred a few weeks ago to a book published last year in America, a long book dealing
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:05.680]   with this whole matter, and it was interesting, not to say almost amusing at times, to see
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.960]   how the author, when he really was in a difficulty, always fell back on the warning passages.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.440]   In other words, it really does come to this, that there is nothing to be said against the
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.920]   doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints apart from the warning passages.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.440]   They do constitute the real difficulty from the standpoint of exposition and elucidation
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.960]   of this great doctrine.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.040]   Well now then, you're familiar with them.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   The one I read at the beginning, "Ten Virgins," "The Five Foolish Virgins," and indeed the
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.960]   next parable also, "This Third Men to Whom One Talent Only Was Given," and I might have
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.640]   read also the third parable in that about the final judgment of the nations and the
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.240]   people who stand before our Lord, and so on.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.360]   The three, as I want to try to show you, really are teaching the same thing.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   Well now, there's a typical example which I'll come back to in a moment in detail.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.560]   But now, how do we approach these warning passages?
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.880]   Well, I can do nothing again but suggest lines of interpretation.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.640]   And the first principle, which it seems to me is absolutely essential at this point,
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:39.400]   is that we bear in mind the state and the condition of the visible church.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.760]   Now here's something which we don't hear much about these days, but which in times past
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.040]   used to be greatly emphasizedâ€”the visible and the invisible church.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   There's a great distinction.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.160]   But then, what is important is, I say, that we realize the truth concerning the state
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.040]   of the visible church.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.080]   I've already just touched on this.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:13.440]   I did so last week in dealing with the passage that we examined in John 15, 1 to 11, because
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.680]   it came in there and helped us at that point.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.160]   But we must come back to it again, because I'm more and more convinced, the more I go
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.040]   into this subject, that the chief difficulty with people is that they have not grasped
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.720]   this point about the state and the condition of the visible church.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.160]   What I mean is this, not only the visible church today, but still more, the visible
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.520]   church in New Testament times.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.480]   And that as we read our New Testament, especially the epistles and letters written to churches,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.200]   we've got to remember that they were writing to the visible church, not to the invisible,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.720]   but to the visible, the church which is at Corinth, the church at Ephesus, the church
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.160]   here and there, visible churches.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   Now why is this important?
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:15.800]   Well, for this reason, that we must not assume that everybody who belongs to a church is
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.040]   therefore of necessity a Christian.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.100]   Now it sounds so simple and elementary, doesn't it?
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.040]   And yet there's great confusion, because people don't realize that.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   There is such a thing as what the Puritans used to call a temporary faith, or which we
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.560]   might equally well describe as a false profession.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.600]   Now the Puritans wrote about the false professor, and differentiated between the false professor
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.080]   and the true professor of the Christian faith.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   Well now these are the terms, a temporary faith or a false profession.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.240]   And what is more important than that we should realize that?
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:07.840]   I would add to that that you can even have a false or a spurious experience.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.080]   All experiences are not of necessity produced by the Holy Ghost.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.900]   The Bible itself is full of warnings on that point.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.600]   But people are so liable to think that because they get an experience in a church building,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.920]   that it must be a true experience, doesn't follow at all.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   We have our Lord's authority for saying that when the seed is being sown, the devil is
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.120]   always present and watching, and doing his nefarious work.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:45.040]   Very well then, now here is the broad principle, that we must realize that we are dealing with
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:52.480]   the visible church, and that the visible church, like the children of Israel marching from
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.440]   Egypt to Canaan, is a mixed multitude.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.840]   If we once begin to think that everybody who's a church member is a Christian, well then
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.740]   we'll never be able to understand these passages, and we'll end in a state of confusion.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.560]   But the Bible itself gives us, as I'm going to try to show you, ample evidence to show
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.760]   that that's a very false assumption.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.720]   Now then, now this is something I say which is taught in many places in the Scripture.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.840]   Let me give you a quotation even from this epistle to the Romans with which we are dealing.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:34.460]   Take chapter 2, at the end of chapter 2 in this great epistle, in verses 28 and 29.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.840]   The apostle, as there you remember, had been arguing about the whole relationship of the
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.680]   Jews to the law.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.520]   The mistake the Jews made was to think that because the law had been given to them, that
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.440]   because they had the law, because they were possessors of the law, that somehow or another
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.520]   that meant that they were all right as regards the law.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.080]   That was their foolish mistake.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.800]   So he has to keep on saying to them, "Behold thou art a Jew, and restest in the law, and
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.240]   makest thy boast of God," that's verse 17, "and knowest his will, and approvest the things
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.920]   that are more excellent being instructed out of the law, and are confident that thou thyself
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.720]   art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, an instructor of the
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.080]   foolish," and so on.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.160]   But then comes the question, "Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   thyself?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.840]   Thou that preachest a man ought not to steal, dost thou steal?"
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.280]   In other words, his point is this, that a mere knowledge of the law is nothing in and
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.680]   of itself.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.800]   The question is, what is a man's true relationship to it?
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.440]   And it's exactly the same, he says, with circumcision.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.760]   He says, "Circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law, but if thou be a breaker
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.600]   of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.280]   And then he winds it up in verses 28 and 29, and here's the principle.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.000]   "For he is not a Jew that is one outwardly."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.880]   The fact that a man had been circumcised when he was a boy, a child, an infant, doesn't
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.040]   mean that he's of necessity a Jew.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.880]   He is not a Jew which is one outwardly.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.240]   Neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.200]   But he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.080]   spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.920]   You see, that was the whole trouble with the Jews.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   They thought they were all right with God.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   Why?
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.160]   Because they'd been born of the seed of Abraham, because they'd been circumcised, because they
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.600]   were the people who had the law of God given to them.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.920]   And his whole point is, you can have all that and still not be a Jew.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.800]   What makes a man a Jew is not something outward, it's something inward.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.160]   It's not in the flesh, it's in the spirit.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.440]   Now that's his great emphasis.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.360]   Now this is the principle, I say, which is equally applicable in the church.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.120]   There is nothing so fatal as the notion that because, well yes, because we were born the
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.360]   children of Christian parents, and because we were christened when we were infants, and
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.440]   have been brought up in the church, that therefore we are Christian.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.160]   Nothing has done so much harm to true Christianity as just that teaching.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.600]   And everything that encourages such an error is something which is bad in and of itself.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.960]   However, let me give you his other quotation, it's in the ninth chapter, the chapter following
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   our chapter tonight.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.280]   Here it is in a very explicit statement in verse six.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.440]   The second half of verse six in chapter nine.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:55.120]   "For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel."
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.960]   Now there's a crowd of people, they're of Israel.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.400]   They're not Gentiles, they're Jews, they belong to Israel.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.200]   They're in the company of Israel.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.120]   He says they're not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.920]   Indeed he goes on in chapter 11 to say that at that time, and as at other times, there
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.000]   was nothing left but a very little small remnant.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.640]   Just a remnant according to the election of grace.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.640]   A great crowd of people, but very few belonging to the true Israel.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.760]   Just a little remnant.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.900]   Now all that is equally true of the Christian church.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:40.680]   And that's the principle that I'm saying is absolutely essential to our understanding
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.920]   of these particular passages.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:49.200]   Now it is because of the truth of this that we have so many exhortations in the scriptures
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.160]   to examine ourselves.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.840]   Take for instance 2 Corinthians 13 5.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.160]   Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   Now remember he's writing that to a church.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.560]   He's writing it to church members.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.320]   Not to the world, to church members, professors of the Christian faith.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.880]   Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.320]   Prove your own selves.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   Know ye not that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates?
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.000]   That's it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.320]   So you see they're exhorted to make sure of this because of the possibility of their
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.520]   having a temporary faith or a false profession.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.360]   You've got the same thing in essence in 1 John 4 1.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.240]   Beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.120]   That's more to deal with experience of course.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:50.360]   But it's the same principle that we must not assume that because we've had certain experiences
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.840]   in the realm of the church that they're of necessity of the Spirit of God.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.680]   We've got to prove these spirits.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.320]   There's an Antichrist, there's a false spirit who can simulate the Christian experience
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.560]   and thus be very misleading.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.280]   Now all that kind of thing becomes necessary because of the state and the condition of
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.200]   the visible church.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.880]   It's a mixed multitude.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.160]   Always has been, always will be.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.280]   Until the church is finally purified and glorified.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   Very well.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.680]   There's our controlling principle.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.160]   Keep that in mind as you come to these difficult passages.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:35.520]   Very well then I move on from that to my second principle which follows from it in this way.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:45.480]   The primary purpose of these warning passages therefore is to test us in that very respect
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.120]   and from that standpoint.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:54.860]   The purpose of the warning passages is to test our profession in order that we may know
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.280]   whether it's true or whether it is spurious.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.120]   They are given to us to warn us against this terrible danger of having nothing but a false
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   profession.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   Very well.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.220]   Now there is their primary function, their first function.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.480]   In other words we can put the doctrine like this.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:24.560]   Our profession of faith needs to be tested and the ultimate test of it is what it produces
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   in us.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.760]   What does it lead to?
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.240]   It's easy to say things but the question is, is it real?
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.360]   So the test is ultimately the test of continuance.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.200]   The test of conduct, the test of behavior, the test of fruit.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.800]   Now you notice how I'm putting it.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.760]   This is where the whole thing is so subtle.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:58.320]   We don't make ourselves Christians, we don't become Christians by anything that we do.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.840]   It isn't even my belief that makes me a Christian, still less my good works.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.000]   No no, it is the action of the Spirit of God in me that makes me a Christian.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.520]   No man can make himself a Christian, it doesn't matter what he does, you must put his belief
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.720]   in the same category as his good works.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.840]   A man doesn't save himself by anything that he does, he is saved.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.760]   Very well.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.840]   So while we say that, we've nevertheless got to put that other side as well.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:39.880]   We've got to say that a man must test his belief, his profession, by these various tests
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.840]   which prove its genuineness, its continuance, its endurance, and certain fruits and results
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.560]   which are going to follow of necessity.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.920]   If you like, the controlling test at this point is that famous statement of James.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.040]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.360]   Now these two things must always go together.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.880]   We are justified by faith only.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.440]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:18.720]   And the business of the warning passages is to help us to discover whether we have got
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.640]   this living faith, or what you may call a dead faith, what I've called a temporary
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.040]   belief or a temporary faith, or a false profession.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.600]   And that's how you test it.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.680]   James, far from contradicting Paul, is saying the same thing in a different way.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.960]   He's supplementing it.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.280]   These two things always have to be held together.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.880]   Because you see, the danger for the man who sees the faith principle is to say nothing
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   matters but what I say I believe.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.760]   As long as I say that I believe, it doesn't matter what I do, everything is all right.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.840]   That's his danger, and he needs to be warned against it.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.400]   The Scripture always has a balance.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.680]   It warns us against two false extremes, always at the same time.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.740]   Very well, then.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:12.900]   This I say is a principle that is quite crucial in the interpretation of this particular passage.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.380]   You see how it works.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:24.540]   Take that verse we were dealing with last Friday night, 1 Corinthians 9 27.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.540]   If you didn't accept the exposition I gave, well then you're driven back to this.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:36.520]   That the Apostle is saying that what really saves him and keeps him is his own action
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.460]   in keeping down his body.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.300]   And if you say that, you're back to justification by works.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.900]   The very opposite of what the Apostle teaches everywhere.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.500]   It's one or the other.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.440]   If we at any point are responsible for our salvation, well then the credit must be given
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.320]   to us.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.300]   The credit must be given to Paul for keeping down his body.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.580]   That isn't what Paul's saying for a moment.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.780]   He is using this in the way that I'm going to show you now.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:13.220]   These passages, warning passages, are brought in under that heading "faith without works
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.220]   is death."
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.700]   I might have put it, therefore, under that particular heading.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.540]   But it seemed to me more convenient to put it under that other heading of a test of our
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.500]   work and our activity, as it were, our calling in the Christian life.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.260]   But the principle is precisely the same.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.060]   Well now let me give you someâ€”let me illustrate this principle which I've been laying down.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:41.060]   Let's turn for a moment to those parables that we read at the beginning in Matthew 25,
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.700]   starting with the parable of the ten virgins.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:52.300]   Now here's a parable that has often tripped people and caused them to be very unhappy.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   Why?
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:22:03.980]   Well, they say, what you've got there is a picture of ten virgins, typical ten members
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.180]   of the Christian church.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:14.340]   And yet we are told at the end that five of them are outside, and that they're not admitted.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.540]   In other words, they were in the church, but now they're kept out of it.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.220]   It's possible to be a Christian and at the end to be outside and to be lost.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.780]   That's how it's commonly interpreted.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.260]   But now let's examine this.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.740]   And let's examine it in the light of the principle that I've been laying down.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.740]   You see, people get into trouble for this reason, that they're ensnared by the fact
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:47.740]   that up to a point these two lots of virgins are absolutely identical, the two lots of
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.980]   five.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.380]   You look at them at first and you can't see any difference between them at all.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.560]   We are told incidentally that five were wise and five were foolish, but by just looking
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.600]   at them you couldn't tell that.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:08.060]   What you see is two lots of five girls, and each one has a lamp.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.620]   They've all got lamps in exactly the same way.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.960]   Not only that, they were all going to do the same thing.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.180]   They were all going to a wedding.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.180]   There's no difference at all there.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.260]   And they were all waiting for the same bridegroom to come.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:29.380]   And not only that, they all slumbered and they all slept.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.700]   All those things are true about every single one of them.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.220]   And it's because of that people assume that we are looking at an account here of ten people
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.940]   who are true Christians.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:45.820]   But then, alas, we find at the end that five of them are expelled.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.280]   They're outside.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.700]   So that you can be in grace and you can end by falling out of it and be everlastingly
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.940]   lost.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:01.160]   But now look at that for a moment, and you see where it lands you.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.620]   What is the difference between the two?
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:08.120]   Well, the difference between the two is that the five wise virgins took oil with them,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.120]   and the others didn't.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.260]   Very well, what does that mean?
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:20.300]   Well, if you take the usual interpretation, you are driven to say that it means justification
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.940]   by works.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.900]   Because these five virgins were wise enough to take the precaution of taking oil with
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.420]   them, they're saved.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.860]   The others didn't, and therefore they're lost.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:39.540]   So the five wise virgins saved themselves by their action in taking the oil.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.160]   That's nothing but sheer preaching of justification by works.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.680]   That you're a Christian because of a good life you live, or because of something that
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.420]   you've done.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:55.860]   But that is the whole doctrine which is denied by the Apostle in this epistle to the Romans.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.580]   That's why he wrote it.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:03.460]   The whole object is to show that that is the ultimate error, to think that any man can
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.660]   justify himself before God.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.380]   Doesn't matter how good his works, doesn't matter how excellent his actions, nothing
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.120]   that a man can do can justify him in the sight of God.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.240]   He concludes at the end of chapter 3 that we are therefore justified by faith, and by
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.200]   faith alone.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.600]   So you see, you cannot accept that as an interpretation.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.840]   It makes your scripture contradict the scripture.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.640]   Well, very well, we come back again and we say, well then what is this?
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   What is the point of the parable then?
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.940]   Well now then, wait a minute.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.240]   Take this key of the visible church.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   What do you find?
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.080]   Well, you find ten people in the visible church.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   They appear to be identical.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.720]   They are members of the same church, church members together, and they go to the same
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   meetings.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.560]   They seem to be doing everything in exactly the same way.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:01.600]   Yes, but there's a very essential difference between them.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.280]   What is that?
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.240]   Well, it's this.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:15.440]   These foolish virgins have got a purely selfish and self-centered attitude towards the whole
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   thing.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.280]   They want the privileges, they want the pleasures, they want to be in at the feast, they want
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.560]   to welcome the bridegroom and get the banquet and all the rest of it.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.280]   Yes, but obviously they're not interested in anything else.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.600]   They do nothing at all about this.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.720]   They've got their eye only on the benefits.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.720]   Now that is the characteristic always of the false professor.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.240]   There are people who don't want to go to hell.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.040]   There are people who want to be blessed by God.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.320]   They want certain things which God promises to give.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.160]   They want all that they can get, but they don't want anything else.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.760]   They don't want any responsibilities.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.160]   They really are not truly interested in the thing.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.200]   They don't think it out at all.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.800]   Now that was why these were foolish.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.840]   You see, they pick up the lamp and off they go, and then they feel tired and they fall
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.480]   asleep, and then when the bridegroom comes and the call is given, they suddenly find
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   they've got nothing.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.640]   They've never troubled about it at all to find out whether they have got anything or
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   not.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.200]   Now there are so many like that in the Christian church, aren't there?
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.800]   There are people who don't like a searching sermon.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.080]   This is what makes me feel uncomfortable.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   I don't like it.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.600]   What right is he to preach like that?
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.360]   They are Christians.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.760]   They assume they're Christians.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   Exactly.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.600]   That was the whole trouble with the foolish virgins.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   Assuming.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.200]   Not thinking, assuming.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.720]   Taking it for granted.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.680]   Not making sure, not examining, not proving their own selves, not examining their own
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.800]   selves as the scriptures tell us to do.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   No, no.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   I'm a Christian.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   I've always been a Christian.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   Why?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   I've never done anything wrong.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   You're familiar with their talk.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.920]   They always resent anything that searches them, anything that exempts them.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   They don't want that.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.520]   They want to enjoy the benefits.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.920]   That's what we are told about the foolish virgins.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:15.840]   The parable of the foolish of the ten virgins is nothing but a test of profession.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.760]   Here are people together in the professing Christian church, and yet we are told there
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.040]   is this vital difference possible between this wisdom and that folly.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.680]   And it shows itself, you see, inevitably.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:39.720]   The true Christian is always concerned, careful, examines, wants to make sure the other person
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   doesn't.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.380]   The other person is in the realm of the church but quite careless, not really interested
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.560]   in the thing at all.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.100]   It seems to me that is the only interpretation of this matter of the oil.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:29:00.840]   You mustn't turn it into wax, but you can turn it and must turn it into a concern about
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:06.000]   the things in which you're involved and about the benefits that you're enjoying.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.560]   It's a very useful test, that, and it's a very comforting test.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.480]   If you were concerned about your salvation, if you're worried and troubled about it,
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.680]   I would say to you in the name of God on the basis of this parable, you've got very good
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   presumptive evidence that you're a wise virgin.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.960]   But if you're unconcerned and never examine yourself at all and resent any call to that
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.980]   or when that's done to you, I suggest to you very seriously that you'd better go back and
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.840]   examine even the foundation as to whether you're a Christian at all.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.500]   Foolish virgins never like such advice.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.660]   They just want the ease and the benefit.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.640]   Or take this, well, take something even further.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.440]   Here at the end, you notice how our Lord puts it, "Afterward came also the other virgins,
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.760]   the foolish ones, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:06.520]   But he answered and said, 'Verily I say unto you, I know you not.'"
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.100]   That doesn't mean he didn't know about them, he knows about all.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.000]   It means he's never known.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.240]   He's never known them in the way that we've seen this word always means in the scripture.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.320]   I've never been interested in you.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.000]   You've never really belonged to me.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   That's what he says to them.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.600]   And he never says that to anybody whom he's ever known.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.920]   Never.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.240]   That's what's impossible.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.280]   But he's never known this.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.000]   And so we are exhorted at the end, "Watch therefore."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.480]   In other words, examine yourselves.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.760]   Take the second parable.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.120]   It's the same thing.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.400]   Look at this odd man, this one man.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.160]   You see, at first he seems like the others.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.920]   He comes forward and receives the talent.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.960]   They'd received talents, he receives talents.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.000]   There's nothing in the fact that it was five, two, and one.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.120]   That's not the point at all.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.040]   The fact is this man received a talent in exactly the same way as the other received
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   talents.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   Yes, but the general resemblance ceases.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.640]   There is a general resemblance.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.680]   There always is.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.340]   That's what makes it so difficult to know who's who in the visible church.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.240]   Who is the true Christian, who is merely the temporary or the false professor.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.320]   Yes, but there's a very valuable test suggested here.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.520]   You notice the attitude of this man, don't you?
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.560]   His whole attitude is revealed to be entirely different.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.840]   First two, given their talents, they want to do something for the benefit of their master,
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.160]   not this last man.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.280]   He that received one went and digged in the earth and hid his Lord's money.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.440]   And later on he gives us the reasons for this, displaying that his whole attitude has been
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   wrong.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.200]   This is how he puts it.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.800]   Then he which had received the one talent came and said, "Lord, I knew thee that thou
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   art an hard man."
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   See that's his attitude.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:10.160]   "Reefing where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed, and I was afraid,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   and hid thy talent."
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.280]   His whole attitude is one of antagonism and of fear.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   There's no love there.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.920]   There's no desire to please there at all.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.360]   The man betrays himself.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.800]   Though he appears on the surface like the others, he shows in his spirit, in his heart,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.680]   in his whole attitude, that he's not.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:37.040]   And there are less, there are people in the Christian church who call themselves Christians,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.160]   who rarely hate God.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.560]   They talk about the Christian life being narrow.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.500]   And when they're exalted to holiness and sanctification, they don't like it.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.800]   They want to get all the benefits that Christianity can give, but their feeling is that it's a
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   hard life, it's a narrow life, it's against the grain.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.320]   They're always kicking against it.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.080]   They're church members, exactly like these men.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:06.120]   And it is only such people to whom these words are addressed.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.880]   "Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap what I sowed not, and gather where
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   I have not strawed.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.760]   Thou wouldst therefore put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   have received my money.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.240]   Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which hath ten talents.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.920]   For unto every one that hath shall be given, this man hath got nothing, and he shall have
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.360]   abundance, but from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath."
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.760]   Now that's paradox, isn't it?
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.980]   But the meaning is perfectly plain.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.560]   This man has never really had the real thing, he appears to have it, but what he appears
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.960]   to have is taken from him.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.160]   He's really got nothing at all.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.200]   And "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   gnashing of teeth."
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.960]   And the last parable in this chapter really teaches precisely the same thing.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.320]   You remember what we are told here about this great jutterant and the two groups, sheep
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   and goats.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   What's the basis?
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   Well, here's the basis.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:10.040]   "Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, Come ye, blessed of my father,
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.360]   inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.400]   For I was unhungred, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink, and so
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   on.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:24.760]   Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee unhungered and fed thee,
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.920]   or thirsty and gave thee drink?
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.600]   When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee?
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.800]   Or when saw we thee sick or in prison, and came unto thee?
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.560]   And the king shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.000]   it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.320]   Then shall he also say unto them on the left hand, the others, Depart from me.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:55.120]   Ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.960]   For I was unhungered, and he gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and so on.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:04.640]   Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee unhungered, or a thirst,
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:11.000]   or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.880]   Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.080]   unto one of the least of these, ye did it not unto me.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:24.800]   And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous unto life eternal.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   Now then, here is a parable that's so frequently misunderstood.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:33.360]   It teaches quite plainly that what saved the first people was that they had done these
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.000]   good deeds unto our Lord's brethren, and because of that they're saved and they're
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   praised.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.360]   But again, there's only one answer to that.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:49.720]   It can't be that, otherwise that is justification by works.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.960]   The Son of God need never have come into the world, he need never have died on the cross
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.080]   on Calvary's hill.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.460]   It would mean that we save ourselves by doing good.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.440]   You cannot accept it, it's got to be rejected.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.640]   The scripture is nonsense, if that is true.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.040]   Well then, says somebody, what does it mean?
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.400]   Well, I've already given you the key.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:20.800]   You notice the interesting thing about these people, they have done all this good without
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.480]   knowing it, without realizing it.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.240]   They say, but when did we do this?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.600]   You are praising us for having done this, that, and the other.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.040]   When did we do this?
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.080]   Now that's the typical Christian, you see.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.920]   The man who's not a Christian, but the false professor, he boasts of his works.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.800]   His second lot are saying, if we'd only known, we'd have done it, and thereby we'd have put
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.120]   ourselves right.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.400]   Never the true Christian.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   The true Christian is never aware of what he does.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.200]   He thinks nothing of what he does.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.080]   He feels he's an unprofitable servant.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.880]   The whole glory of the action of these men is that it's unselfconscious.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.680]   In other words, it's this, you see.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.460]   The Christian produces a fruit, and he's not aware of it.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.400]   The attitude of the Christian to himself is, oh, how little am I doing?
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.000]   How little do I love the Lord?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.600]   He's aware of all his deficiencies and defects, and he's amazed when the Lord praises him,
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.760]   or chooses to smile upon him, and to give him an embrace and a kiss.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.160]   He's amazed at it.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.360]   But the other people demand it as of right, and are ready to defend themselves.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.520]   You see the difference?
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:34.860]   The test is the spirit, the spirit and the unselfconscious fruit bearing.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.780]   You mustn't bring in justification that works at any point.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:44.020]   No, no, the three parables are simply to test the professors in the Christian church.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:50.140]   At the beginning, they all look identical, but you examine carefully, and you'll find
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.460]   that there's a very real difference.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.560]   Examine yourselves, says the Christian, prove your own selves, make sure which of the two
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.160]   groups you belong to.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.500]   Very well, there is our first illustration.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.560]   But I must take you to a second notable illustration of the same thing, and that's in the book
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:15.080]   of Revelation, this time in chapter 3 and verse 5.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.960]   Now here we read this.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:24.360]   This is the letter to the church at Sardis.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:34.080]   He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, now here's the word, and
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:41.960]   I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.600]   father and before his angels.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.240]   Did you notice how I read that?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.600]   Let me read it again.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:59.080]   He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot his
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.640]   That's the emphasis that certain people put on this in their interpretation.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.440]   You see, what it said was this, I will not blot his name out of the book of life, there
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:24.880]   are others whose names I will blot out of the book of life, but I will confess his name
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.160]   before my father and before his angels.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.280]   There are other people in whose case I won't do that.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.020]   But I want to try to show you that that's a very false way of reading this verse.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.320]   It's a very false and totally unjustifiable emphasis.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.160]   That isn't what he's saying at all.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.440]   But it appears like that, doesn't it?
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.800]   Our Lord seems to say, I will not blot his name out of the book of life.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.280]   The obvious implication is that there are people whose names are going to be blotted
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.380]   out of the book of life.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.940]   And that's the argument people bring, and they say, therefore, you mustn't teach the
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.280]   final perseverance of the saints.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.360]   Doesn't the risen Lord tell the church of Sardis that there are certain people whose
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.240]   names are going to be blotted out of the book of life?
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.380]   It appears to say that, doesn't it?
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.480]   And many have assumed and drawn the deduction that it does say that.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.640]   Now then, how do we approach it?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:23.760]   Well, when you have a case like this, the first thing you say is, is there any other
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:30.320]   reference to this book of life and names in the book of life in this same book of Revelation?
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.960]   And you find that there are.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:39.880]   You'll find in the 13th chapter, in verse 8, that you read this, Revelation 13, 8.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.600]   And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, this is one of these beasts, all that
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.840]   of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.300]   Notice that, it's an important statement.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:09.160]   Now there are some authorities who say that this should be read like this.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:18.400]   All them that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:25.800]   of life from the foundation of the world of the Lamb slain.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.680]   In other words, they argue and there's a great deal to be said for it.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.760]   It can't be proved, it seems to me, one way or the other.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.800]   That we're not so much being told that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:42.560]   world, as that the names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.080]   And it seems to me, if I had to say one or the other, I'd say the second.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.920]   That the reference is not to the slaying of the Lamb, but to the writing of the names
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   in the book of life from the foundation of the world.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   Well, there's our second reference.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   Bear it in mind.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.840]   We'll then go on to chapter 17.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:06.400]   And again you'll find a statement in verse 8, Revelation 17, 8.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:13.480]   The beast that thou sawest was and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.440]   and go into perdition.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:22.720]   And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.120]   life from the foundation of the world.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.680]   Now there's nothing here about the Lamb slain, you see.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.600]   Here it is quite clear, and that's why I choose that interpretation in chapter 13 in
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.640]   verse 8.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.480]   They shall go into perdition, and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder they whose
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:45.920]   names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.000]   When they behold the beast that was and is not, and yet is.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.200]   Now there is a perfectly unambiguous and clear statement that the names were written in the
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:02.720]   book of life from the foundation of the world, which means before the foundation of the world.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:10.440]   And the last reference is in chapter 21, in the last verse, verse 27.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:16.680]   And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:25.400]   abomination, nor maketh a lie, but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.680]   These are the only people who are going to be admitted into the holy, the heavenly city,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.680]   the heavenly Jerusalem.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.160]   Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.040]   Very well, what do we deduce from these quotations?
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:46.440]   Well there's only one deduction to draw, and it is this.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:56.600]   That the names are written in this book of life before the foundation of the world.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:03.360]   That of course is to be exactly parallel with the statement that we are given in Ephesians
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.600]   1 and verse 4.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   The apostle is addressing the Ephesians, he says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.920]   Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:23.800]   in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world."
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.080]   You see the procedure is this.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.560]   These people were chosen before the foundation of the world, and their names were then written
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.080]   in this Lamb's book of life.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.040]   The only names put into the book of life are the names of those who are chosen, and both
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.640]   things are done before the foundation of the world.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:54.480]   Obviously this is an action which was taken on the basis of God's foreknowledge.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:00.880]   Now at this point, it doesn't matter how you interpret foreknowledge, whether you interpret
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:07.560]   it as so many people like to do, as simply God knowing what was going to happen beforehand,
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.840]   or whether you take the better interpretation, which means that he set his heart upon them,
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   set his affection.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.060]   But from this standpoint, it doesn't matter which of the two you take.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:22.320]   You can even take that, that he just knew beforehand what was going to happen.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.060]   Very well then, what conclusion do we draw?
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:34.800]   We must draw this conclusion, that if it is possible for anybody's name to be blotted
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:43.640]   out of the book of life, God must have made a mistake when he wrote it then.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.900]   He made a mistake.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.680]   If you take foreknowledge as just meaning that God knows everything that's going to
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:54.160]   happen beforehand, and stop at that, if he's put anybody's name in the book of life and
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:00.040]   then has to blot it out, well he couldn't have known that they were going to fail.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.040]   You see the thing is ridiculous, it's impossible.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.800]   It can't mean that.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.660]   Now then, there's the answer to the question quite sufficient.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.660]   But notice this in addition.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:16.400]   The statement is a negative one, not a positive one.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:22.640]   There is no statement in the scripture anywhere that anybody's name is going to be blotted
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.120]   out of the book of life.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.840]   All we are told here is this, "He that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.920]   and I will not blot his name out of the book of life."
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.200]   It's a negative statement, that he won't blot it out.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.480]   There is never a positive statement about anybody, that his name is going to be blotted
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.840]   out or may be blotted out, never.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.080]   It's just a negative.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.680]   In other words, what we've got here is a well-known figure of speech, which goes under
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.600]   the name of Leitertes.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   What's Leitertes?
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:00.480]   Well, Leitertes means saying a thing negatively in order to give it emphasis.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.320]   We've got the perfect example of that in Romans 1 16.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.500]   Listen to Paul.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.500]   What does he say?
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:13.080]   He says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.080]   What's he mean?
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.320]   He means that he's very proud of it.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   He's just been saying.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.160]   He says, "I've been preaching, I'm a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians,
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.200]   both to the wise and to the unwise, so as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:30.920]   gospel to you that are at Rome also, for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.120]   He's not apologizing, you know.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.460]   It's a negative to bring out a positive.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.880]   It's a way of emphasizing.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:44.200]   It's a well-recognized figure of speech, which is called Leitertes.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.000]   Can I bring the matter right home to you by putting it like this?
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.200]   This is said to be the great characteristic of the Englishman, who always puts a thing
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   negatively.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.480]   It isn't confined to the English.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.120]   It is particularly true of them, perhaps.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.000]   But it's a great characteristic also, I think members of the medical profession would
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.440]   agree with me in saying, of most patients.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.520]   When the doctor asks the patient whom he's been treating, "How are you?"
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.960]   The patient is very fond of saying, "I'm no worse, thank you."
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   Very well.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.560]   I'm saying these things in order to fix this in your minds.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.840]   It's a well-recognized form of speech.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.480]   I'm not ashamed of the gospel.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.640]   Not ashamed of it.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.960]   I'm exalting it.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.160]   I'm glorying in it.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.920]   It's everything to me.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.400]   But it's a very good way of putting it at times.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:45.240]   This is light it is, and that's what we've got in Revelations 3, 5.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:49.320]   I won't blot his name out, of course I won't.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:55.120]   He's praising this kind of person, but he puts it in that dramatic manner in order to
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.240]   give it additional emphasis.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:06.920]   Now I'm simply adding that as a kind of over-plus to show you how unthinkable the other explanation
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.160]   is.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.320]   The ultimate argument is the one I've given you.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:20.240]   That on any show, if God has put a name into that book of life before the foundation of
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:27.720]   the world that he later has to erase, he has no foreknowledge of any kind.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.720]   Can't have.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.400]   He'd never have put it there if he'd known what was going to happen.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:38.360]   So I think I'm justified in saying once more, as I have said several times in dealing with
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.320]   this matter, take time with the Scriptures, my friends.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   Don't jump.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   Don't say it's obvious.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   There it is.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.280]   No other possible explanation.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.640]   Then remember your central fundamental doctrines.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.280]   Never arrive at an interpretation that queries justification by faith only, because you're
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   already wrong.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.320]   Well then, then come back and take time.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.540]   Look for parallels.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.960]   Take Scripture with Scripture, and you'll see that the Scripture will lead you.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:16.120]   The names have been written before the foundation of the world, and on the basis of God's foreknowledge,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:21.600]   it is impossible that it can ever be blotted out.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   And indeed it doesn't say that.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:32.160]   It is this negative to emphasize a dramatic positive, that these people might be encouraged.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:37.320]   That is, as I'm trying to show you, one of the great purposes of these passages.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.840]   Well, our time has gone again, our last, but these matters are so important.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:47.600]   There are so many who are distressed by this, that the time I know is well spent.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:53.440]   God bless these words to you this evening through his Holy Spirit, and enable you to
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:59.880]   see that it's the devil who would twist these verses in order to rob you of the joy of salvation.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:06.840]   There are still other passages that we must go on, God willing, to deal with next Friday
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:14.000]   night and attempt to round up the argument for this most glorious doctrine of justification
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.600]   by faith only.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   Let us pray.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:28.280]   O Lord, our God, we thank thee once more for thy gracious and kind dealings with us, for
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.240]   all the things with which thou hast provided us.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:37.120]   We do indeed begin to see the meaning of thy word to us through the Apostle Peter, that
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:42.840]   all things pertaining to life and godliness are already provided.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.080]   Lord, receive our humble and unworthy praise.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:55.480]   Bless thy word to us, and grant that we all may rejoice in our salvation.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:02.080]   And know the Spirit testifying with our spirits that we are thy children, and that nothing
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:09.080]   shall ever be able to separate us from thy love, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:15.920]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.040]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:28.600]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:51.120]   until we shall see him face to face as he is, and be like him in glory.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:53:19.160]   Amen.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:29.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
