[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   You're listening to the recording of it.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   But it was recorded live,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   and I think we got some interesting topics.

[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   a conference call that was recorded with the patrons of the show.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Some interesting topics came out.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Been doing these conference calls
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   with the listeners, the patrons of the show,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   patrons at the $10 and up level,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and they've been really fun.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Which, by the way, this was the deal of the century
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   for some of you who are patrons.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   A couple of the calls, we've only had a few people there,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and so I've had lots of time to be able to answer
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   individual questions.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So this has been super, super fun.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and then I'll be back to a more regular schedule
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   of what I've put out on the Patreon page
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   of a monthly schedule instead of a weekly schedule.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   But here during the month of October and November,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I've done one every week with patrons of the show
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   at $10 and up, and there's been some really cool topics,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   some really cool discussions, and I decided today
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   to release this audio to you for your show today.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So we're gonna get straight to that super quick.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I'm gonna cover sponsors today in record time.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Two sponsors today.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   First sponsor is Jay Fleischman.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Jay has been on the show recently.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He was on episode number 214,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and then also recently, 258,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   as we launched his sponsorship on the show.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   If you're not familiar with Jay,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   if this is your first time, Jay is awesome.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He is a student loan attorney, a bankruptcy attorney,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and a consultant and host of the Student Loan Show.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   The reason he's on the show as a sponsor,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   if you have student loans, he can help.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So in short, if you haven't listened to those two episodes,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   go back and listen to those two episodes of the show,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   258 and 214, and check out his information.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You will learn more about student loans in those shows
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   than you've ever learned in your life, I promise.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And then if you have student loans,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   go to studentloanshow.com/radical
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and ask Jay for a consultation.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You'll be glad you did.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He may be able to help you find some ways
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   to save some serious money on your student loans.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   If you are in any kind of difficult, challenging situation,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   make sure you talk to Jay and sign up for Jay's podcast.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   That's why you should call Jay.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Next, Patrick Snow, the publishing doctor.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Patrick has also been on the show with episode 252.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   He is a publishing coach.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And in short, if you have ever thought about writing a book,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   you should go to thepublishingdoctor.com.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Take a look at some of his services that he has to offer
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and consider reaching out to him for a consultation.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   He can work with you in a consultative capacity
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   to help guide you through the process of publishing your book.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Patrick is awesome.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   He's been hugely helpful to me.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I think that some of his methodology,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   some of his resources can be a huge help to you.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So that's sponsor of the day number two, Patrick Snow.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He'll offer you a complimentary consultation
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   if you would like to speak with him about publishing
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and ask him questions about your potential book project.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   His cell phone number is linked in the show notes today
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   or just go ahead and remember it now.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Text him at 206-310-1200
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and you can get in touch with him directly.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Those are our two sponsors.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Finally, patrons of the show, thank you.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   All of you who are on -- all of the callers

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Let's kick it off with Bob.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Any questions, anything you're thinking about, Bob,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   that I can help you with,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   anything I can be of service to you on today's call?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Knowing the business that I work in,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I would like to hear your opinion on disability insurance
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   for self-employed.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Hard to get, but valuable to have.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Hard to get, yes.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Have you shopped around?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I'm a licensed producer as well,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and knowing how hard it is to get
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and the hoops you have to jump through,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I wanted your input.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I've got a couple of workarounds,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and I'll give you some ways to approach it.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   First, though, have you ever tried to get it?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Have you ever applied for a policy before?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yes, yes, and I'm not qualified.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Rejection.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Based on income or based on where you work?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   No, no, no.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Based on medical.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Okay.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   All right, so a medical disqualification,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   that's the hardest to overcome
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   because what that means is if you're in a situation
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   where you're dealing with a medical condition,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   then that's not related to whether you're self-employed
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   or whether you were employed as a straight W-2 employee.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Depending on the medical condition,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   you want to shop around,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and you want to look to see --
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   you want to shop around, and you want to look to see
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   if you can get a better offer from another carrier.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   How many carriers did you apply with?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Two.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Okay, and both of them turned you down?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Yes.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Who were the carriers?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I don't remember.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It's been six years, and at the time, I wasn't licensed,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and I had an agent that was doing it for me.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I'm confident in that agent, but I didn't --
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I let him shop it because he was independent.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Okay.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's worth shopping yourself.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   What I would do -- you are licensed now
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   with a health and life insurance license, right?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   All four terms, yes.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Okay.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Yes.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Go to the broker that I used to use
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   was a broker called DI Broker.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Go to DIBroker.com and call their specialist
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and just tell them the details of the medical condition.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Tell them what you're facing
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and talk to their underwriters on the phone.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   The way those brokers usually will work
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   is they will have a phone answerer,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   basically somebody basic,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   and then they'll have a back-office underwriter.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Just go ahead and ask them, maybe --
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   just tell them what you're doing and ask them,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   "Do you need to talk to one of their internal underwriters
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   or just give them all the details?"
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And what they'll do is they will look at the case.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   What you can do if you want to find out
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   without making a formal application
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   is submit what's called an informal inquiry
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and submit to them an informal inquiry,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and depending on the carrier and depending on the case,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   what that means is you'll give them your name,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   all your contact information.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You'll give them your Social Security numbers
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and your medical records, and then what they'll do
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   is they'll pull your medical records.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   They will verify and look at the details
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   of those medical records, and then they will --
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   they'll shop it around.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   They'll talk to some underwriters,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   some of the carriers,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   without doing a full-blown application.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So that can help you to get an answer
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   on the medical question
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   independent of the income question.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So that's where I would start
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   is with a disability insurance broker like DI Broker
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   and submitting an informal inquiry.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Assume for a moment you get good news back
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   on the medical situation, and they say,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "Hey, you know, we'd be willing to consider it."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And DI Broker, I mean, they'll shop it with everyone.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So depending on the case and depending on whatever,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   you might end up with, you know, Standard Insurance Company
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   or you can place cases through them with Boys of London.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And so sometimes, depending on the medical condition,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   they can achieve a specialized scenario.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So it's all very subjective.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   As far as the financial underwriting,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   the things that hurt you on being self-employed
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   are usually two things.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Number one is generally your income is --
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   you're going to show a lower income
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   than you actually enjoy
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   because you're going to be writing off so many expenses.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And so that's good for your tax bill,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   but at the end of the year, it's bad
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   for your disability insurance applications,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   and it's bad for your mortgage applications.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So you got to take that into account.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So most self-employed people are dissatisfied
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   with the offers that they get.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   So to make up round numbers,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   let's say that you are showing $5,000 a month of income,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   but by the time you take out all the deductions,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   you're actually benefiting at $7,000 a month of expenses,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   part of which are flowing through your account.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Well, remember, they're not going --
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   your disability insurance broker isn't going to offer you
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   anywhere close to 100% of your income.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   They're going to offer you, you know, maybe $3,000 a month.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So this really annoys most business owners.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   They look down and say, "Well, what am I going to do
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   with $3,000 a month?"
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   What I would suggest to you is consider --
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   consider that $3,000 a month.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   If you did get disabled, it's better than nothing.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So it's not 7, but it's better than 0.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So it's worth doing.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   The way you can supplement that is you can consider
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   supplementing that with a disability overhead
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   expense insurance policy.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Are you familiar with DOE coverage?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   No.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Okay.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So the way it works for business owners
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   is that you can get a personal disability insurance policy,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and that personal disability insurance policy
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   can cover your income.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But as a business owner, you can also get
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   a disability overhead expense policy,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and that overhead expense policy can cover the expenses
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   from your business.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So with the expenses from your business,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   you can use that to run some of those
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   and cover some of those fees and costs
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   that you have associated with your business.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   That would be your rent, your phone lines,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   your web servers, your web hosting,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   that kind of thing, depending on employees,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   depending on the makeup of your business.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Employees can be problematic, or they can work,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   but you can cover some of your overhead.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So let's say that you have $2,000 a month
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   of monthly business overhead.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You can get a disability policy that might cover
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   $1,500 a month of monthly business overhead.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Now, with that $1,500 a month of monthly business overhead,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   if you get disabled, they'll cover that
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   for a certain period of time.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Disability overhead expense policies
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   are generally short-term policy.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Usually about a year or two years at the maximum,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   whereas an individual disability income policy
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   can cover you out through maybe, you know,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   age 60, 65, 70, depending on the policy.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So it's going to be a short-term deal
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   that helps to cover your overhead.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So look at your cash situation and see,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   would that be helpful to you?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   The purpose behind disability overhead expense policies
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   is to cover you if you got disabled,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   to keep the business going in absence
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   of some of the revenue so that you can either,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   you know, by the end of 24 months,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   with most entrepreneurs, if you're disabled,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   at the end of 24 months, you're going to know,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I'm going to be back to work,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   or I'm going to sell this thing.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And so it helps you to keep the business going
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   in the interim and keep your bills paid
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   so you can either keep the business
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   as a going concern, so you can sell it
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   at the end of two years, or helps it to still
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   be healthy enough for you to come back into.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   So that can be a way for you to get
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   a little bit of additional coverage
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   on top of a personal policy.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And sometimes it's worth your checking into,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   based upon your medical condition,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   it's worth your checking into as a component
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   of your disability plan because it might have
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   different medical underwriting.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Because they're shorter-term policies,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   there are some medical conditions
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   that are unlikely to cause problems
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   in the short-term, but likely to cause problems
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   in the longer-term.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And disability insurance, disability overhead
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   expense policies are shorter-term policies,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   so that you might be able to find some wiggle room
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   there on the medical underwriting.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   The third idea doesn't work as well now
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   as it used to, but one thing you might
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   consider doing is looking for what's called
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   a long-term care insurance cash indemnity policy.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I don't know if these are available in your state.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   You need to find a friend or call somebody
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   who does long-term care insurance
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and ask them or ask a broker if they know
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   of any company that writes long-term care insurance
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   cash indemnity policies.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   So let me explain the concept to you.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It's hard to find these anymore,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   but most -- they're not indemnity policies.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Yeah, they are.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   They are indemnity policies.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'm getting my lingo confused.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Most long-term care insurance policies
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   are reimbursement contracts.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   So let's say that you have a long-term care
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   insurance contract that covers you
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   at $5,000 a month, and in order to get benefits
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   from that, you need to submit at the end of the month,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   you need to submit receipts for the cost of your care.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So let's say you have $4,000 of care,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   then you can submit receipts for that $4,000,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and they'll reimburse you for up to the amount
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   of the cost of your care.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   But there is another type of policy
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   that's called a cash indemnity policy,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   where they will -- if your policy is for $5,000,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   as long as you meet the circumstances
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   of the contract where you would qualify as needing care,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   they'll pay you the straight cash fee.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And so it'll be, you know, again, $5,000.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   What that can be useful for is it can be useful
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   for somebody who needs to cover living expenses
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   in addition to long-term care policies --
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   long-term care expenses.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Now, the qualifications to qualify as needing --
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   as getting benefits under a long-term care contract
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   are different than under a disability contract,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   but it is possible that a really significant disability
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   would indeed qualify you as needing care
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   from the long-term care insurance contract.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And so the cool thing about it,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   if you can find one of those policies available
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   in your state, the cool thing about it is
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   that it'll give you a potential benefit there
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   that can come in as cash,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   and those are medically underwritten differently
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   than disability insurances,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   and also they don't have the stringent financial underwriting.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   So I only could have replaced one of these,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   but I had a client of mine who was a rancher,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   and he made a lot of money,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   but due to the nature of his business structure,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   his income, his paper income, his net profit
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   at the end of the year was always extremely low,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and so he couldn't qualify for a disability insurance policy
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   that was worth anything to him
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   based upon the amount of income he could prove on paper.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   But the long-term care insurance contract,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   we were able to get some contracts in force
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   where it would cover him as a cash indemnity contract
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   for $5,000 or $6,000 a month if he ever needed care,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and so that provided a little cushion for him
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   where if something happened and he met the minimum requirements
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   of the policy to pay him out benefits,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   needing help with at least two of the six activities
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   of daily living,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   then he would get simply a straight cash compensation,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   which he could use for anything that he wanted to,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   not just for the care expenses.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So those would be my three big ideas for you.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   See if any of them pan out for you.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Okay. A follow-up on that.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   The last one you talked about,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   is that kind of like an AFLAC-type plan,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and then the other for business owners,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   is that through my BOP policy, business owner policy?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   No, your business owner policy covers you for--
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   that's written with a property insurance company,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and that covers you for the things that are associated
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   with the business liability, on-premises, things like that.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   This is totally separate.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   So the disability overhead expense contract will be written--
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   it's from a health insurance company,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   or a life insurance company,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and you'll get that also through the same broker
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   that you get a personal disability insurance contract through.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So again, check with the DI broker,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and they should help you out with that.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Since you're licensed, you can talk to them directly.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And on the long-term care policy, no,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   that is not an AFLAC policy,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   but you should check the terms of the AFLAC policies
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   to see if they have anything that's going to interest you.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   But no, the long-term care cash indemnity policy
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   is not written by AFLAC.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's going to be written by another company.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   The company that used to offer them here in Florida
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   was a company called MedAmerica.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The challenge is this is the most difficult area
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   in the long-term care insurance marketplace
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   because what happened was these policies used to be popular,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   but the companies that were offering them
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   are not as financially sound as they once were.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And so if you do buy that type of contract,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   you need to go into it with your eyes wide open,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   and you need to keep a careful eye on the actual carrier
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   to make sure that they continue to be financially sound,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and you need to be prepared to bail on the contract
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   if the company starts to get into trouble.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   So it's the riskier side of the companies
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   that offer that type of contract.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   All right, perfect. Thanks, Josh.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   You're welcome.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   On it, as a business owner,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   there are also a lot of things you can do
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   to minimize your risk due to the structure of your company.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So with owning a business, a plan for disability,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   remember that some things--
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   insurance will solve some of the problems,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   but unlike an employee, you have more leeway.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So an employee who's just a straight W-2 employee,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   if they get disabled and they can't work, they're screwed
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   because that income is the only thing they have
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   that's covering themselves.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Well, as a business owner,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   depending on the nature of your business,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   you can go ahead and put in more systems.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   You can hire more people.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   You can set things up and plan in the business
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   so that if you did get disabled,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   everything wouldn't fall apart.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So keep an eye on both sides of the planning.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Insurance is less relevant for business owners
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   than is good planning.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   So I think it has a place and it's valuable,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   but also recognize that even if you can't get it,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   there's a lot you can do to set yourself up
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   to protect yourself even without insurance.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Agreed. Joshua, thank you for the answers.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Detailed, that's what I need.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Good stuff, Bob.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   All right, let's see.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Who has a call next?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Let me go--I've got a few more callers that have joined.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Let's go to Indiana.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Nate, anything I can answer for you today?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Yeah, I do have a question.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   My dad has a cleaning company up in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   northern Indiana,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and he has a bunch of low-wage part-time workers.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He has, like, 20 people that work for him,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   and probably three-quarters of them are doing whatever they can
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   to pretty much, like, maximize their welfare.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And he was explaining it to me.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   There's something like if they earn over 15--
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   between, like, $15,000 and $30,000,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   they're basically not making any more money.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   They don't get married, and they have, like, a couple kids,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and they're doing all this stuff to maximize their tax credits.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I don't really fully understand it,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   but I was just wondering if you could say something about that.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And they seem to think it's just going to keep getting easier for them,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   but I tried to explain to my dad, you know,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   this whole welfare state thing isn't sustainable,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   and they're probably putting themselves at major risk.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   So I just wondered what you thought about that.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Well, I applaud them for making use of the system.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   That's one of those areas I struggle to know--me personally,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   I struggle to know how to talk about the ethics of that situation.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   The conservative, you know,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   hardcore conservative libertarian in me
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   wants to get up on my soapbox and jump up and down
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and rail at people about you should--
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   you know, you're ruining the system, you're destroying everything.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   You know, how can you do this?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   What about the values of taking care of yourself
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   and not being a leech off of the state?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   So that makes me--you know, that's my initial response.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   But then on the flip side, as I've watched,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I've actually changed a lot my own personal opinions
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   over the last number of years.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   If you look at the way that the U.S. government operates
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   is we advertise most of the benefits
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   to try to reach people that are in that situation.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   So, you know, the federal government runs advertisements
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   for the, you know, food stamp program.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   There's advertisements for the WIC programs locally.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   There's advertisements for welfare payments.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I mean, so they're advertising the services.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Yeah, I've noticed that.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   It seems like they're, like, must be gaining more benefit.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   They must think they're gaining more benefit
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   than they are from, you know, not doing that.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And I've heard Warren Buffett talk about
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   trying to increase the earned income tax credit
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and all this stuff, and it just doesn't make sense.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Like, when you're already operating at a major deficit,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   how can you keep offering those programs?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Well, and this is where we get into the very fun
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   and very divisive political discussion is --
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and these are my opinions on the subject.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   If you recognize the interests of the people
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   who pull the purse strings, the interests of the people
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   who pull the purse strings is power.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And so the way that you manipulate power
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and the way that you manipulate people
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   once you have control over the purse is with money.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so you use the federal government
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and you use the purse strings of the federal government
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   to create power for yourself,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   and you do that during your time in office.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And then once you leave office,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   you've accrued the power for yourself,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and then you go out into the private market,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   and that's when you benefit.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So if you go and just go and study
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   and watch what happens with the --
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   watch what happens with those who run the government,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and after their time of government service,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   then they go and slide over to the market,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and that's when they get their compensation
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   for all the inside deals.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   And so the inside deals happen --
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   you need a voting block to get you in,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and so you give away money as much as possible,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and that helps you to secure a vote.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And then you need a -- you need a --
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   you need the corporate interest,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   the large corporate interest, to secure your --
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   you know, to really move and fund your campaign.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And so, you know, you can make the argument
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   that, well, it's a sense of altruism
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and trying to help and keep people from being poor.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   I haven't seen enough evidence to convince me of it.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   That's the divisive political argument.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   That's why I think it's not.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Now, to answer your question,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   how confident are you predicting the date
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   at which the U.S. government is going to run out of money
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   and not be able to do it?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Are you ready to set the date on that?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   No, it seems like they can just push that
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   into the future perpetually.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Exactly. So --
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I mean, money -- the money is so fake.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   It just doesn't make any sense to me
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   that we're even living in a money economy,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   because when you look around --
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I was a naturalist for years, an environmental ecologist.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And when you look around at natural systems,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   like, no other animals are living in a money
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   or really even a barter economy at all.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And I don't -- I mean, I feel like, in a sense,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   like money is evil
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   because it's forced everyone into far more labor
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   than is needed.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   When you look at hunter-gatherer societies,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   they're only working --
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   they're putting in a few hours of real work a day
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and then having lots of leisure time.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But in our country, you know,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   people are working their tails off.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   It's weird.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   So you're opening probably one of my most --
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   the most interesting cannons of worms
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   that are just fun to talk about.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And it's the kind of thing that,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   over a cold drink and a good cigar,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   you can go on for hours, all night long,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   on this stuff.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It's -- have you studied the history of money
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   at all yourself personally?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   No, not really.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I know it kind of started as agriculture.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   But I'm sure there was, you know,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   some hunter-gatherer tribes that would just,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   you know, get together every once in a while
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   so they would use a barter system.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm not sure if that's really how it started.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   That's -- so with my understanding,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   and I'm not an expert in this space,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I'd encourage you to go find someone who is.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I'm a student. I'm not an expert.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   But there is a popularly held misconception.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And I'll just give you a few thoughts
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and I'll answer your question.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And this is one that I don't want to take the whole call
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   and go for an hour on the topic.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   But I'll give you a few thoughts.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   There's a popularly held misconception
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   that money developed from -- out of a barter economy.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And this goes back all the way to, you know,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   I think Adam Smith was one of the writers
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   who popularized this notion.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   And he went back and said,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   "Well, here's how money developed.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   We all started, you know,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   we were hunter-gatherer societies.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And then you had a deer,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and somebody else said,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   'I want some of that deer in here.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I'll trade you an arrowhead for the deer.'"
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And we developed the barter system.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And then we needed some kind of currency
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   that would be useful.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And that currency would be --
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   you know, so it came to the coin system.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   That's popular mythology around money.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   From all the research I've done,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   that there is no historical evidence
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that that was how money was developed and created.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And there's substantial evidence
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   that goes against that
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and demonstrates that that's demonstrably false.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   That money is normally, actually,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and has historically been a system of credit.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And that it's almost always based upon
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   a system of credit.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   So I don't buy necessarily all of the arguments
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   that people say,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "Well, we just have to have a currency system
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   that, you know, is based upon
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   we all need gold and silver coins,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and based upon the gold and silver coins,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   then we're going to be able to run things."
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I don't buy the barter concept, personally.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Now, there are a bunch of other areas
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   that these theories branch off into.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And so I'm also not a fan of the way
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   that the system currently functions.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   But we're doing some research on it,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and you'll find that money has generally
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   come down to a system of credit.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And so back to the current situation,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   as long as the U.S. government
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   can maintain faith in the credit
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   of the U.S. government
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and the credit of the dollar,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   then our current economic system will continue.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And this is what always really troubles people,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   is they look at it and say,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   "How on earth do I go through...
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   How on earth is...
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   You know, with the trillions of dollars of debt
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and the massive issues all around,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   how has the government been able
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   to keep the fabric of society together
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   for this long?"
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And I think they'll probably be able to do it
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   much longer than people think.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   But at the end side,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   so back to the employees,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   at the end, in the short term,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I don't think they have much to worry about,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   because the political force is,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   on all sides,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   is to provide people with more.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   You don't see any political candidates
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   on either the Democratic or Republican Party
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   arguing for cutting back on anything.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   You don't see anybody arguing
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   for pulling back on the welfare state.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   All of the political candidates,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   with maybe the exception of Rand Paul or Ted Cruz,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   which neither of them looks like
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   they've got a shot at any kind of traction
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   in the Republican Party,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   all of the political candidates
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   are big government progressives
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   who are going to continue to expand
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   the welfare state.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And so, once you recognize that,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   you can...
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   My opinion, who knows?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   History could prove me wrong,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   but my opinion is that you're not going to see
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   any change in policies.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Nobody is advocating for any serious change
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   that's going to affect your dad's workers.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   In the long run,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   I think, ultimately,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   that I'm convinced that, in the long run,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   there will be the so-called "Great Default,"
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that there is no possibility
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   that the U.S. government
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   is able to maintain its overall promises.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   And so, those promises are multifold.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Number one is you have the national debt
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   that is on the books,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and so that's about $18, $19 trillion right now.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And then you have the major debts,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   which are the welfare programs,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   and you total the unfunded liabilities up with that.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And depending on what estimate you read,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I go with Lawrence Kotlikoff's numbers
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   from Boston University,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   you're up at about $200 trillion.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And so, there's no possible way
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   that that debt will be repaid
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   or that those obligations will be shifted.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And so, what will happen is, in my opinion,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   and this is a prognostication,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and I could be absolutely wrong,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   but what will happen is that, ultimately,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   the voters will, over time,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   screw everyone who's got the obligations
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   from the government.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And so, all of the welfare programs,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   they'll be pulled back because they're unaffordable.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   The long-term payments to the pensioners,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Social Security, Medicare,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Medicare benefits will be pulled back.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And you can see signs of that
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   to some degree, I think,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   if you pay attention to inside situation,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   to inside industry.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   So, where I noticed this as a health insurance agent
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   was in the long-term care space.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   We were talking a moment ago
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   about long-term care insurance policies.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   In the past, Medicaid had generous benefits
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   for long-term care coverage for seniors.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And that coverage, and so many times,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   when I was selling long-term care insurance,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   people would say, "Well, Uncle Joe needed care.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   He had Alzheimer's,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   and the federal government paid for him
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   for nine years to stay in a nursing home.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And he had plenty of money,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   and they just had that as part of his benefit."
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Well, that was true, but it's no longer true.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And the government has pulled back
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   on all of those benefits,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   such that there is still long-term care coverage
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   as a component of Medicaid,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   but it's nowhere near as generous as it once was,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and it's much more restricted than it used to be.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So, in the long run,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   anybody who's depending on the welfare state
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   for their livelihood is gonna get screwed.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Now, what's that long run?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I have no idea.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Is it 10 years, is it 40 years, is it 50 years?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So, my encouragement to your dad would be
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   have him put in place
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and try to just simply provide education
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   as much as possible to fulfill,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I would say, his moral obligation to his workers
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   to educate them, give them some,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   provide for them some resources
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   so that those who are interested
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   can liberate themselves.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Because as long as you're living,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   as long as you are living off of the back of the state,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   you're a slave of the state.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And so, if I were him, I would try to promote,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   I would try to promote some education
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and some knowledge for his workers,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   try to make some resources available,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   offer to help any of them that want help,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   but ultimately, he's not gonna change anything,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and they're not gonna change
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   until circumstances force them to change.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Those are my thoughts.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Yeah, I can definitely see that.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   In a certain sense, I feel like
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   almost all of us are slaves to the state.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Just property taxes,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and it's just impossible to live a life
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   without government.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Well, that's why I promote the stuff that I do,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   and why you're promoting urban farming.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   The last call, you know,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   when we talked two weeks ago on this call,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   that's why, here's the dichotomy that I see.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And again, this is kind of that fun,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   personal argument back and forth.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   In the aggregate, I don't see,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   the state has never been more powerful
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   over our individual lives, in the aggregate.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   But on the individual level,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   there's never been more freedom than there is now.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And so, yes, on the whole,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   society is carefully manipulated and controlled,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   but you and I as individuals
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   can come out of the cave, to use Plato's allegory,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   and can make decisions that will enhance
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   our own personal liberty.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And there's never been more freedom, ever,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   that I'm aware of in the history of the world,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   to make those kinds of decisions.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And when you can compound the fact
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   that just simply by waking up,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   paying attention to your own situation,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   and living a lifestyle of freedom yourself,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   you can help to enjoy the freedom.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And when you compound that
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   with the ability that each individual person has,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   to influence other people individually,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   but also to influence people on a public stage,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   there you have the greatest harbinger of liberty of all time.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Because you can start an urban farm,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   you can teach other people to start an urban farm,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   you can, and every individual person can go on Facebook
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   and has their podium and their soapbox
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   to be able to challenge other people
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and to affect other people.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   So, the way I look at it,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   and I am more optimistic about the future
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   than almost anybody else is,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and so as long as you prepare and plan
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   for the death of the welfare state,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   which I don't see any way that that could ever be avoided,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I don't have a clue as to when it will happen.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   But I could be wrong.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   But as long as you plan and prepare
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   so that you are personally okay
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   when the welfare state starts bouncing checks,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   then in the long term there's going to be more liberty
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and freedom for all of us than there ever has been
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   in the history of the world.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   So, that's how I approach it, is on the whole, yes,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   government will continue to grow,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   state will continue to control,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   but as individuals, there's freedom.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Encourage yourself with the statistics
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   that give you hope.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   So, I focus on schooling because if you look at that,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   there have never been more people learning
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   and developing independent education than ever before.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   And if you look at the trends, the mass trends,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   look at what has happened with the Khan Academy,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   look at what's happened with online education,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   that is the brightest hope for the future,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   is that steadily, little by little,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   the school systems will systematically implode.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   They're overburdened.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   The teachers are going to be replaced by online teachers.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And so the best teachers in the world
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   are going to be teaching the classes.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Everything is going to be available for free online.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Once you break that system,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   and there's no reason for it,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   no need for anybody individually to break it,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   it's just going to happen based on the market forces,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   then systematically that will result
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   in a decreasing power of the state.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So, those are my political prognostications.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Now you can sit back and we'll find out if I'm right
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   or if I'm wrong. I have no idea.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Anything else on that, Nate?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   No, I think we're probably good on that.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Cool. Let's go on.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I mean, we could talk for hours about that.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   You've indulged my political vent,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   but let's see who else has a question.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   All right, who else would like to ask a question
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   or chip in a topic for today?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I've got a Maryland caller.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I've got a 240 area code.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Who's that calling in from Maryland today?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Hello, my name is Daria.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I'm calling from Maryland.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Hi, Daria. Can I answer any questions or help you?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Yes, I do have a question.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I feel that for other listeners
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   it will be very basic,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   but I guess I should ask anyway.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I'm really new to financing,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   but I've been reading books and trying to figure out
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   how should I start investing,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   what would my portfolio in the future look like,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and so on and so forth.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Now I am at the point when I know
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   that when I save some money
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   and I know that I want some individual stocks,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   some bonds, maybe treasury bills and rates.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   But what I don't know what to do next,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   so I assume that I need to open a brokerage account.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   But the thing is I don't know how to approach
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   opening a brokerage account,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   because I'm thinking that there are, first of all,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   several of them which I don't know how to choose.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I'm thinking there are fees associated
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   that I might not be aware of.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And I'm also thinking that probably
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   they offer different investment vehicles,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and depending on what I want,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   some may have it, some may not.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   So maybe if you can give me first advice,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   let's say I want to open an account and start investing,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   how should I approach this?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Great.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   So I can do that, and I'll give you some suggestions.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Before I do that, is it okay if I ask you
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   a couple of quick questions just to get a sense
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   of where you are in the process?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Okay.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Do you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   401(k) or 403(b), something like that available to you?
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Yes, and I have a match,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   and I use it to my advantage.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   I do.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Okay, so you are participating, great.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And why are you--
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   and so you desire to purchase individual stocks,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   or you're trying to purchase mutual funds.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Tell me about what type of investment plan
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   you're hoping to pursue.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   So I read a book which is called "Investing 101,"
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   but Christy Christoph--I don't know if you know it,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   but it's something that I started with
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   to get myself oriented.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   So I know that I should probably purchase mutual funds,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   but because I work in the biotech industry
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   and I have a PhD in a relevant discipline,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I really want to--I have certain companies
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   in biotechnology that I would like to have in my portfolio,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   and I wouldn't trust any broker to select them for them
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   because I know maybe too much about the industry
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   to trust other people.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   So this is the reason why I want to have some individual stocks
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   because I feel I understand how to handle those.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   But I also want to diversify and have some mutual funds
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   because I know very little about other industries
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   and I know how biotech is risky and so on.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Perfect, okay.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   So you said exactly the words that I was looking for,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and the words that I was looking for was,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   "I work in this industry and I have some knowledge of this area
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   and I have expertise."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   So the reason that I was looking for those words
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   is I think that the mistake that most people make
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   is assuming that they should be investing in stocks
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   when they should really be considering investment
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   on a larger scale.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   So one of my personal opinions is I do not like
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   that when I say the word "invest,"
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   most people automatically assume I should purchase
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   publicly traded securities.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   When I use the word "invest," I would like people to think about
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   all of the options that are available to them,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   and that can be everything from making sure that your car maintenance
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   is up to date so that you don't have an expensive bill
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   right at a moment when you can't afford it
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   to purchasing the office building,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   the five-story office building that your company is in
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   so that you can manage it and rent it out to your other friends.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   So if you look at investing, you've got to look at a couple of things,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and I look at it, I think about it as a scale
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   from passive to active.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   And so in many ways, I think that we should reserve
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   the stock market as one option,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   and we should look to see what are the returns
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   that I could expect to achieve from the stock market
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and use that as a placeholder,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   and then look to see can I beat that with something else in my life,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   some other inside information or some other inside knowledge
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   that I have, and do I have the time and the ability to pursue that.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   So I like for people to think about investing bigger
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   than just putting money into stocks.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   That said, stocks are powerful,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   and the ability to own small shares of other individual companies
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   that people are running and pursuing for an entrepreneurial--
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   from an entrepreneurial perspective is really, really powerful.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   When it comes to investing in individual stocks,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   there is a lot of noise out there and a lot of marketing hype
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   about how people can beat the stock market.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   There are thousands and thousands of books
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   about here are the types of stocks you should buy,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   here are the specific ways that you should approach it.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   The majority of those books and the majority of that advice
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   has no-- there's no proof to it.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   They're baseless claims that, well, you can beat the stock market.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   At the end of the day, if you purchase the stocks
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   of 10 so-called blue-chip companies,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   10 big publicly traded companies,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   that's probably going to be pretty decent investments.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   They're well-regulated, they're well-run,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   the boards of directors do a good job of keeping those companies working.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   But to say I'm going to have some kind of inside information,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   you need to really be dedicated to that scenario
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   in order for it to be worth it.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   So I try to discourage people from buying individual stocks
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   and then let them kind of prove to me that I'm wrong.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   And the way that you can prove to me that I'm wrong
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   is to say, well, there's an industry
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   or there's something that I'm very interested in
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   and I have some knowledge, I have an ability to look
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   and I want to do the research and I want to look to see.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   So biotech would be a good example of that.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   You're involved in the industry,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   you would know what the companies are,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   you have an interest in it,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   and you have an ability to look at press releases
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   and things like that and perhaps look for ways
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   to find the companies that are going to be more promising.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   So how to go about opening the accounts.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Before you open any kind of account,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   sit down and create an investment plan.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   It doesn't have to be complicated.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Just sit down and write down on a piece of paper
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   what you're investing for, why you're investing,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   and what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   This is the missing step that most amateurs never do
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   is they never say, here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   And you should have a goal for what you want to do
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   with the money, you should have a strategy,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   and you should be able to identify,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   So the reason this is important is if you start there,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   you're going to make better investing decisions.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   If your reason for investing was,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   I want to buy a new beach house in three to four years,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   well now you're going to know that I'm probably
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   not going to pursue the same scenario as,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   I want to potentially strike it rich
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and make some massive growth by investing
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   in some small companies.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   So create a plan, make it simple,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   there's plenty of information out there,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   but at least start with being intentional.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   What am I trying to do?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Next, look at all of your assets and figure out
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   how much money can you afford to risk.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   So you should look at your savings,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   you should look at the money that you have
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   in your 401k plans, and you should look to see
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   how much money can I afford to risk.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And only risk the money that you can afford to lose,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   especially in something speculative like biotech.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   My guess, and you may have more knowledge than I do,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   my guess is that in biotech,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   you're either going to have flat companies and losses,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   or you're going to have the potential for a company
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   to hit something big, invent some hot new drugs,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   and have a huge, huge rate of return.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   So you're probably going to have a very wide-ranging
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   investment portfolio where only a few of your companies
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   are really going to make it big,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   and most of them are going to struggle,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   some of them are going to go bankrupt,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   some of them are going to develop some steady streams,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   but you're really looking for the big wins.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   That might be the case, I might be completely wrong.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Make that plan.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   When it comes to actually buying stock,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   your company pension plan is probably
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   not the right way to do it.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   If you're going to buy mutual funds,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   depending on the type of mutual fund you're going to buy,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   that's going to depend on the type of brokerage account.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   So if you were going to purchase index funds,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   well, you'd just go to Vanguard.com,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   you'd open an account with Vanguard,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   and you'd purchase your index funds there.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   But if you're going to purchase other types of mutual funds,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   you might want to purchase them directly
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   from the mutual fund company,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   you might want to purchase them through a brokerage account,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   through an online discount broker.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   You can also purchase your stocks
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   through an online discount broker.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   And for you choosing them yourself,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   that's probably going to be all you need to do.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   There are a number of good ones.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   So there are some big names, E-Trade,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   I think Schwab, TD Ameritrade,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   are some of the ones, Scottrade
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   are some of the ones that come to mind.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   I am in the process of bringing on a sponsor on the show
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   for a company called Trade King.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   We're in the final negotiation of a sponsorship deal.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   And Trade King, I interviewed the CEO on that show,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   his name is Don Monsenaro.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I interviewed him a couple of weeks ago
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   from the FinCon Financial Bloggers Conference.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And they're down in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And I decided to bring them on as a sponsor of the show.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   I really like them, I like what they're doing.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   They're not the biggest company,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   but I feel very confident that that would be a good choice for you.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   You can open an account with them,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   and you can, they'll wait a couple of days,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and once you hear them,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   or maybe it might be a couple of weeks,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   but once you hear them come on the show as a sponsor,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   there'll be a special deal for listeners of the show,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   a special bonus if you open an account with them.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And you can open an account with them,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   you can place your trades,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   and you can purchase the stocks of those companies with them.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   So that's the specific answer for how to open a brokerage account.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I don't know of any reason why you would choose anybody
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   other than Trade King,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   but as with anything, you should go and do your own due diligence.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   But I will be bringing them on the show as a sponsor,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   and they can help you with a brokerage account
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   to purchase those individual companies.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Make sure that when you're doing it,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   you're doing it within the context of your bigger investment plan,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   and your bigger financial plan, and your financial goals.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   And then you'll be able to make really good decisions.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   You'll be able to stick with your trading plans,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   and hopefully be able to make a lot of money.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   It'll be awesome.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Does that help a little bit?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Yes, that's perfect.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   I actually, I was considering Trade King.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   I think I heard the podcast that you did.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   And so, yeah, okay, so that's perfect.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   And then in terms of strategies, yeah, I'm thinking about it,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   and they're actually evolving of what I want to do.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   And my original idea was that I want to buy a house in cash,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   and I want to retire in 15 years.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   This was my kind of overall first thing that I was thinking on,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   and then I was trying to calculate what it means to get to this goal.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   But, you know, things are evolving as I am learning more and more about the area.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Right, and so that's where -- that's exactly the type of plan that you want to put together.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   And so you start with how much money would I need to pay for the house in cash?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Then you also look to say if I want to retire in 15 years,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   how much money do I think I would need in order to retire?
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   And then you can plug that into a financial calculator,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   and if you know those numbers I'd be happy to help you do some math right now on the call.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   But you plug those numbers into a financial calculator,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   and you see based upon how much money you have, how much money you can save,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   and your time horizon, and you ask yourself,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   "Is this a realistic goal that I could achieve?"
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And then you're going to know, "Do I think I could hit this with my investment plan?"
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   And so depending on how fast you want to retire, that's going to drive, again, how you invest.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Makes sense.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Yeah, I know rough numbers.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I don't know if it's going to be too burdensome to do it right now, but I can do it.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Let's do it real quick. It'll be fun. I've got a calculator right here.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   So how much money do you think that you need to retire?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   So I was thinking that $60,000 or $70,000 a year.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Well, I would – okay, probably a minimum of $50,000 a year is what I would plan to do when I retire.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   And then if I retire in 15 years, I would assume that I would live at least 20 years after that.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Okay.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Yeah, and then –
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   So let's do an – let's use that as an example.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Let's use the 4% rule as a good guess on kind of a good ballpark range
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   and assume that you want to spend $50,000 per year,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   and so you need a portfolio that you can withdraw $50,000 per year from.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   And so multiply $50,000 times 25, and that gives you $1,250,000.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   So that's the value of your portfolio that you need at the time of retirement.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Now, ballpark – and again, this is a public call, so feel free not to say,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   but how much money do you have saved currently?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   And again, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I can. I mean, the thing is, there are different things.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Do I count 401(k) or do I not count 401(k)?
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Yes, count your 401(k).
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Oh, okay. So 401(k) is probably $40,000, $45,000, and then –
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   it's actually a mixture of the raw pre-tax and post-tax, but let's say $45,000,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   and then plus savings probably around $40,000, $50,000.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   And I do not have any debt, neither college, no mortgage, nothing pretty much.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Congratulations. Okay, so we've got $100,000 now.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   And then how much every year do you think that you can afford to contribute
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   to your investment account?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Every year? Okay. Right now, I'm using YNAB that you recommended to see
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   how much I can actually contribute. Okay.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   I think I can at this moment $3,000 a month, which will make me $36,000.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   I persuade my husband to help me out, let's say $40,000 a year.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Okay. So let me do this math for you, and let's assume that you want to retire
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   in 15 years. That was what you said, right?
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Yes.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Okay. So the way that we do this math – and this is just rough math,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   but to give you an idea of the type of investment plan that you need,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   we put in – into the financial calculator, and it's simple once you know
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   how to run the financial calculator, but you're going to learn that on your own.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   I think I did a show on that, or I need to do some videos on it.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   So first thing we're going to do is we're going to put in our future value.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   So we type $1,250,000, and we put that in as our future value.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   We hit the FV button on our calculator.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   Next, we're going to put in our present value, and we're going to put in $100,000.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   And then depending on the calculator, usually you need to change the sign
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and put it in as negative, so you put in minus $100,000 as our present value.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   And then we're going to put in our annual payment.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   So we're going to do an annual payment here, and we're going to put $40,000
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   of a contribution into the account as a payment.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   And then we're going to run this for 15 years, and we're going to solve
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   for the necessary interest rate.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   I just solved for interest, and the calculator is running here.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   It's going to tell us how much interest we actually need to an interest rate
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   that we need to earn on our money.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Hang on one second.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I forgot to--I made one mistake.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Just a second.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   $1,250,000.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   It's hard to do it and then talk at the same time.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   $1,250,000.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Okay, and it's running again here.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   It's going to tell us what our annual percentage rate of return is
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   that we need.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Okay, so under that scenario, all we need here is a 6.2% rate of return.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   That's all we need to earn on our investment.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   And the way that you can check that is we can just run the numbers again.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   And so what I'll do is I'll say, okay, 6.2%, we've got $100,000 starting point.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   We're going to do this for 15 years.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   We're going to earn 6.2% annual rate of return, and we're going to contribute
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   $40,000 to the account every year.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   So what does that end up with?
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And at the end of 15 years, we would have $1,250,000.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   So the reason I ran that math is to show you that if you can afford to save
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   that much money, you only need a 6% rate of return to hit that financial goal.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Well, you should be able to get a 6% rate of return just with buying an index
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   fund and not putting in any--and putting your money in stocks and not worrying
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   about investing in biotech stocks.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   So you have the decision to say, "Do I just want to buy index funds or do I just
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   want to buy real estate and make 6% and reach those goals and have a much higher
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   certainty, or do I want to invest in biotech stocks?"
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   And so you have to look and say, "How much rate of return do I think I could
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   earn in biotech stocks and do I need to?"
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   And that's what I mean by actually running a scenario because--the next
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   question, do you have a guess as to what rate of return you would hope to earn
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   if you were going to run your portfolio yourself and invest in biotech stocks?
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Oh, good question.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Well, I was thinking 10% should be possible if I make sure that I spend
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   enough time.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Maybe more, but as you said, you've got to be lucky as well as knowledgeable.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Right.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   So if you're in the 10% range, my guess is I wouldn't think it would be worth
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   pursuing biotech stocks as your investment strategy if you only wanted or needed
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   10%.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   10%, you should be able to get there with much simpler, much safer investment
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   approaches versus investing in speculative biotech stocks.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   So if I were you, what I would do is I would create a plan where the majority
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   of your money is going to go into well-chosen mutual funds and I would do that
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   within your 401(k) and things like that.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   And I would produce--I would put something like--I would have a goal of maybe
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   investing $2,000 a month or $2,500 a month into more conservative investment.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   And then I would take maybe a little bit extra, maybe $500 or $1,000 or $1,500
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   a month, and I would use that money to fund my brokerage account.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   And so what you're doing there is you are having a major portfolio that's your
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   conservative portfolio, and then you have a small portfolio that you're investing
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   aggressively.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And the hope is that you can make 50% rate of return or 30% or 80% by picking the
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   right biotech stock, but you're not counting on that to be your whole financial
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   plan and you're not putting all of your money at risk in a very speculative way.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   So that's what I would do is I would have kind of my core portfolio be a little
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   bit more conservative, and then I would have the satellite portfolio--that's kind
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   of one of the words that they would use, this type of approach, your core and your
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   satellite.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   I'd have my satellite portfolio be much more aggressive.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Now, you've got to pick the numbers, but knowing that you could save--if you want
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   to live on $50,000 a year and knowing you can save $40,000 a year and knowing that
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   you don't need that high of a rate of return to hit your financial independence
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   goal, I would focus a lot of my portfolio in a conservative direction, and then I
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   would put a little bit of the portfolio in the speculative direction.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   That would seem like how I would approach it.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Well, thanks so much, Joshua.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Actually, in my wine lab, I budget $500 of stock, which I have not invested in, but
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   I'm budgeting that much money because I know how it goes in this area.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Okay, well, that's wonderful.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   I don't want to take any more of your time, but I have a lot to think about, and
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   it's perfect.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   Good.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Good.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Go slow and make sure that you study, study, study, study.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Go slow.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Don't invest in something you don't understand, and go slow and don't invest
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   any money that you can't afford to lose.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   And, I mean, you're obviously very, very bright, and I think you could put
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   something together very nicely for yourself.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   All right, I'll take one more question for today.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Who wants to ask the final question?
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Hey, Joshua, I just want to follow up.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Actually, I thought that was pretty interesting, but wasn't one major piece
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   of the formula missing, like her age and how many years she was going to be
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   retired?
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   Yes.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I used, just as a sample, I used the 4% rule, and so the data and the research
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   behind the 4% rule is assuming a 30- or 35-year retirement, but what you find is
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   that the right portfolio construction, that it can actually be basically most of
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   the portfolios at a 4% distribution could last into perpetuity.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   So if you're in that 3% to 4% range, then your portfolio should be able to be
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   structured to last for a long period of retirement.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   What I was trying to do with asking those numbers and keeping it simple was simply
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   trying to find out, does she need a 6% rate of return, or does she need a 66%
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   rate of return?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   So if she had told me, "Joshua, I actually want to spend $150,000 per year,"
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   then I immediately know that my ending portfolio needs to be closer to $4
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   million.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   And so if I put $4 million into the calculator, and let's do this again real
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   quick, 15 years, we're going to start it with $100,000, and we're going to make
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   $40,000 of contributions into it.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   Then now, if we need $4 million at the end of 15 years, we're going to, give it
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   a second to run, and it's going to tell us our rate of return.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   It's going to be way, way different than 6%.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   The reason I say that is because I believe that many financial...
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Okay, so now we're at an 18% rate of return.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   So she would need an 18% rate of return every year if she wanted to live on,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   whatever I said, $150,000 a year.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   So she needs a $4 million portfolio.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   I think that's still a workable financial plan.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   But you have to then ask yourself the question and say, "Where am I going to
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   get the $4 million of...
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Excuse me, where am I going to get an 18% rate of return?"
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Well, now you wipe out, "I'm not going to get it in index funds.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   I'm not going to get it in conservative, you know, mutual funds."
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   So now I need to either be very, very good at biotech stock investing,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   and I would need to ask myself specifically, "Do I have these skills?
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Could I develop these skills?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I need to put a lot of time into it, or I need to move into business."
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   And I need to say, "How could I take my $100,000 that I have of capital,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   and how could I develop some sort of business that I would be able to sell
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   at the end of 15 years that would be worth $4 million?"
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   And business people do this all the time.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   And it might be something as simple as, you know, buying a franchise locally.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   It might be a good idea that you've developed.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   But I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility to say,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   "I'm going to accumulate $4 million over the next 15 years."
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   I intend to do that, but I'm not going to do it with publicly traded stocks.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   So that's why I was just doing some rough numbers to get an idea of do we need
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   6% or 18% rate of return.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Is that helpful?
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Mm-hmm. Yep.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Cool. Awesome.
