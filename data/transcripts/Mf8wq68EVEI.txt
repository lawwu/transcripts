[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, obviously we live in fractured and chaotic times.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   And we also know that God's glory is important.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The most important thing in the universe. So, when we survey our world
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and we mentally run the numbers, so to speak, to find the evidence,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   which side of the scale tips? Does this
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   world bring God mostly honor, or does it bring God mostly dishonor?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   In creation, and in this drama of human history,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   which side is winning out?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I love unique, big picture questions like this one today from a listener named Sam in Brighton,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   England. "Dear Tony and Pastor John, I have been listening
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   to your podcast for two years now and have found it invaluable in my own personal journey
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   towards a Christ-centered life. The key foundation of the APJ ministry
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   is that God wishes to be glorified in the everyday actions of His creatures
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and that this is both satisfying and pleasing to Him. I greatly
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   enjoy the study of history and what it tells us about the human condition.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   My interests are in human conflict and approaches to peace.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So often it appears, however, that human history is full of violence,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   war, and suffering. My question is this,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   how does this enormous weight of non-God-glorifying
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   acts stack up against God's desire to be glorified?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I realize that God ultimately requires nothing from us,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   but how can He be satisfied if, quite possibly, there have been
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   far more God-dishonoring acts across the span of human
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   history than God-glorifying ones? How does the
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   philosophy of Christian hedonism answer this imbalance?"
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yeah, maybe, maybe it's the
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   imbalance he thinks. Maybe not.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Sam's observation is that, on the one hand, the Bible teaches
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   that God aims to be glorified in this world. That's absolutely
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   right. God says, for example, in 1 Corinthians 10:31,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   "Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   do all to the glory of God." And Isaiah 43:7 says that
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   God's people are created for the glory of God.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And the prophets teach that eventually the earth will be
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   covered with the glory of God like the waters cover the sea. In Ezekiel
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   20, several times it says that just when
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   it seemed that the world or the evil got the upper hand,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   God says, "But I acted for the sake of My name,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   My glory." So it's really clear from the
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Bible that God intends for nature and history
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   and redemption to serve the glorification
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   of His excellence. Yes. Then on the other
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   hand, Sam points out, because he's a
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   student of history, that the world seems to be full
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   of non-God-glorifying acts,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   more, he would think, than God-glorifying
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   acts. And he wonders how I would address that, especially
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   from the standpoint of Christian hedonism. So let me try.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   In maybe, let's see, six steps.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   First, I would observe that nature
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   from the smallest subatomic particle
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to the largest gathering of galaxies is
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   constantly, without pause, and in
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   millions upon millions of ways, declaring the
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   power and the wisdom of God in this world.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Every animal, every human mind and body,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   every flower, every tree, every cloud, every river,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   interworkings of these realities, they all
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   give an exquisite testimony
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   to the brightness and truth
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   of the glory of God. It would be difficult
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   to quantify this and say that somehow
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   this is less, say, than the
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   calamities of the world which might detract from the glory
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   of God. God is always and everywhere
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   shouting the wisdom of all that he
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   has made. The heavens are telling the glory
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   of God. In wisdom he has made them all.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And just this morning in my devotions, I read that section
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in Romans 1, 18, to the end of the chapter, where it says
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   everybody knows God, and from the creation of the world, all the works that he has
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   made is revealing the invisible attributes of God.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   There's just no room for saying
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   God is not revealing his glory continually through
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   the things he's made. That's the first thing I would observe.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That is an overwhelming testimony, and oh,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   how blind the world is. Second,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I would draw attention to the phrase in the Bible
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   "that they may know that I am the Lord." That phrase
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   occurs 88 times in the Bible. 72 of them
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   are in the book of Ezekiel. That's amazing. Even more
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   amazing is that this phrase is used
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   both when God's people are being
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   saved and when they are being judged. It's used
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   when secular nations are getting the upper hand and
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   when they are being punished. So I think the intention
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   is that in all of history,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   whether we see it or not, God
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   is acting for the sake of his name so that
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   someday we will have eyes to see the way he
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   worked for his name and his glory in the events
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that did not seem that way to us at all at the time.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Third, and this is the most clear and specific and
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   stunning illustration of what I just said, namely the cross
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   of our Lord Jesus. As Jesus comes to the end
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   of his life and he contemplates that in the next hours
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   he will be crucified, he prays like this. This is John 12
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   27. "Now is my soul troubled
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and what shall I say? Father, save me from this
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   hour? But for this purpose I have
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   come to this hour. Father, glorify
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   your name." Then a voice came from heaven.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "I have glorified it and I will glorify it
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   again." In other words, in the absolute
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   worst, most sinful event in the history
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   of the world, the grace of God
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   was being put on display and nobody saw it.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   God's glory was shining.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   The fact that nobody saw it doesn't mean it wasn't
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   there. And nobody saw it. And
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   later, through the eyes of faith and with divine interpretation, we do
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   see it. That's what 2 Corinthians 4, 6 says. We do
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   see it. But when it happened, nobody saw it.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And I think that's the way it is with most of what God is doing
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   in this world, this fallen age. Fourth observation.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   When we ask why there is such pervasive failure
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   on the part of God's people in this world to live
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   a way that glorifies God and why the Bible itself is
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   such a relentless history of failure by
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   God's people, not to mention the nations, Romans 3,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   19-20 gives a remarkable insight.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So Paul has just finished inditing the
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   whole human race, Jew and Gentile, under the power
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   of sin. And then he says this. Now we know
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that whatever the law says, all those Old Testament quotations
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   he's just given to show the pervasive sinfulness of the human race,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   we know that whatever the law says, it speaks
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   to those who are under the law, that's Jewish people,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   so that every mouth might be stopped and the
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   whole world may be held accountable to God,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   for by works of law, no human being
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   will be justified in his sight. In other words,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   one of the purposes of the history of failure among
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   God's people is to stop the mouth of every
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   human being and make clear that no one can get right
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   to God through law-keeping but only through absolutely
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   free, glorious, sovereign grace.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So God intends to show that humans are in an
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   absolutely hopeless condition and thus to
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   magnify the freedom and the beauty of his grace.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Fifth, this leads to the
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   observation that in the end, we will be able to
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   see the God-glorifying purposes of God
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   more clearly than we can now. Consider two images.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You've probably all heard these. I find them both very helpful.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   First, the imagery of a tapestry.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I think Corrie ten Boom used to talk about this.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Now we see the ugly, loose strands at the
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   bottom of the tapestry. Nothing beautiful about it that we can
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   see except by the eye of revelation. But
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   then we will see it from the top
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and the tapestry will be complete, it will be beautiful,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   with the strands all in their proper place, and that will be what history is.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Or consider the image, similarly, of a painting.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   God is now painting a mural of universal
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   history and creation and redemption. And as that mural
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   comes into being, we see this corner, we see that corner, we see
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   this darkness, we see that little bright spot, and we can't make much
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   sense out of it as a whole, just staring at a history
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   with all of its mixed colors and shapes. But
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   in the end, when it's complete, everything
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   will fit together, everything will make sense,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   it will be a perfect display of the glory
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   of God's wisdom and power and grace.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And the last thing I would say is
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Christian hedonism says that
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   God will succeed in finishing the tapestry
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and completing the mural in such
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   a way that there will be a perfect communication
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   of the perfections and beauties of God in all their
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   proper proportion. And God will succeed also
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   in creating a people for himself who
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   finally have eyes to see that glory
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   for what it really is, and hearts finally
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   able, with appropriate intensity, to delight in
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   God's beauty the way they should. And that delight
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   will be the consummation of the demonstration
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   of the glory of the grace of God.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. Great question. I love it when questions get us into
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   these huge macro discussions. And thank you for joining us today
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   for it. You can ask a huge macro question of your own. Search our growing archive or subscribe

[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   with a bang. We're going to hear Pastor John give us 10 or
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   11 of his favorite texts for his hardest battles in life.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   John Piper's favorite biblical promises for life's
