[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140]   I remember people asking about safety in Mexico.
[00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.620]   Is that still a concern?
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.540]   Should people be thinking about that at all,
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.380]   planning a trip?
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.780]   - Unfortunately, there's this stereotype
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.140]   and there's people are always asking, is it safe?
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.160]   In terms of safety and security,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.060]   look, anywhere you can have issues,
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.820]   the idea is to be in the right place at the right time.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.620]   Mexico is safe in general.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.500]   And it's really your responsibility as a traveler
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500]   to make sure that you understand what are the safe places.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.660]   So knowing where you should be and where you shouldn't,
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.860]   being well aware of your whereabouts,
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.700]   those are all kind of recommendations you make
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.660]   for any place you travel in the world.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.860]   Mexico is still a developing country,
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.820]   so you have to be well-educated and aware.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.900]   - And would you say that like a hotel concierge
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.460]   or the person at the front desk
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.900]   is like a good person to ask,
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900]   or how would someone get acquainted
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.380]   with where to and not to go?
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.740]   - Absolutely, I think the concierge, the reception,
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.860]   they're gonna give you good advice
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.900]   as to where, what, when, with whom,
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.540]   how to get around and how to keep yourself safe.
