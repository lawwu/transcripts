[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We're going to move right into the Q&A after just a few words, and we'll move right into the Q&A.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Okay, well here I am again.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I don't know if Gus is still here or not, but a funny anecdote about my work with Gus over the years.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   You know, when you stop being the head of the company, a lot of relationships break down.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   That would never be true of Gus and me, and in February of 2009, I ran into him in the hall,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   and we got talking about the markets, and he said, "You know, I think this is the greatest opportunity
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   to buy a common stock I've ever seen in my entire lifetime."
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And I said, "Would you say that publicly?"
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And he said, "Are you kidding?"
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   [Laughter]
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   So we all bear the burden of our own palability.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   He comes at the issue of market returns very differently from what I do, the way I do,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and almost antithetical, and yet we come out in the same place.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Gus doesn't seem to be as smart as I am in so many ways, and this may be the most important thing.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   He didn't put any numbers on his prediction.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   He just said, "Lower than the past."
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And so I took a look at what I said to you all yesterday, and I looked at a sort of low bearish return,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   assuming a bunch of things go wrong, about a 4% return on stocks in the next decade.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That's with a severely large decline in the P/E.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And then I looked at what my system would predict for the next decade,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   because I was kind of weighing in on my impression, and that's what I had in the charts.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And my system, which is also on slide 41--43, I should say.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And by the way, we're going to put those slides up on Monday on my website,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   so if any of you want to get them, it would be very easy to do.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's my e-book, www.johncbogle.com.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   There's a dot.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And so you'll see in there that the system predicts a 8.1 return.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So just for the heck of an average, we're talking about a 6% return compared to a 9.1% historical.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So Gus and I are going to be--if you give him a number, I'm going to guess it's going to be 7% of the mills.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So we come out of the same place, but what a difference in the way we get there.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I have a lot of quarrels with the efficient market hypothesis,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and a lot of problems with the math, and that is that we talk a lot about risk.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Let me put a number like 9 or 14 or whatever it is on that.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That is unequivocally not risk.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   That is the volatility of the stock market or the volatility of your portfolio.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Now, I'm guessing all of you know this intuitively, because I'd like to have a show of hands here.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Bill Bernstein is not allowed to answer this question.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   What is the volatility--do you know the volatility, the standard deviation of your equity portfolio?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Does anybody here know that?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   One? One hand went up and then down.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Nobody knows that.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And the index, depending on how you do it, the S&P is around 14%.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   That doesn't have anything to do with risk. That has to do with volatility.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And the risk of the market, I'm persuaded today, is quite large,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and I think the market recognizes some of that risk, but not all.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And when you think about risk, what are you really thinking about?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You're thinking about the state of the world.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   You're thinking about war.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You're thinking about the state of the economy.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You're thinking about financial leverage, greatly acceptable all over the world.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You're thinking about a lot of things that can go wrong--global warming, health epidemic,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   growing concentration and bigness of our world.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   These are all big risks that we'll have to deal with over time.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And I went through my whole list here.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I would come up with a conclusion that when you put all this together,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   according to somebody named Larry Siegel,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   you would absolutely conclude that the world is going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   The fact of the matter is, in history, it's always been going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   But it never quite gets there.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So that's called hope, not risk.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So I look at it in a very different way, and I come out about where he does.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And so the efficient frontier changes.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And then there's--I've always had this argument, which you may have heard me use from time to time.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   If you look at that chart of justice, and there's a percentage point here and a percentage point there,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and here's the risk, and here's the--I guess the return is over here, and the risk is down here.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And it kind of equates a percentage point in standard deviation, the way that line is drawn,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   with a percentage point in future returns.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You take one percentage point more risk, you get one percentage point more return.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Well, I always argue, in kind of a nasty way,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that what sense does that make when an extra percentage point of return is priceless
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and an extra percentage point of standard deviation is meaningless?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Think about that. You're comparing the meaningless with the priceless.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So be a little skeptical of all these things, even though Gus, intellectually honest,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   at the University of Chicago, efficient frontier model,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   probably comes out about the same place I do with the future returns.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So we'll just have to see what happens.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I want to mention one other thing about Gus talking about threats to Vanguard,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and he used complacency.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And I have a different kind of threat, which is best exemplified.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   This is not to do with innovation in the firm.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   You know, all those wonderful people you saw last night.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And I saw a group I didn't even know existed at Vanguard,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   helping to educate children at the grade school, the high school, and the college level.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It was a fabulous idea.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Those lovely, young ladies.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Don't make me poke.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And I was so happy to meet so many crew members that I hadn't met before.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   These are not the big shots.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   These are the people who are doing the hard work of keeping this place going every day.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   When you talk about, I think, one of our big risks is a different kind of innovation,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   and that's trying to innovate in the funds we offer.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And I think that is a very bad idea.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   How can you bring out a new fund that you think will do better than the index?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Why would it do that?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   How could it do that?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It can't do that.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It can come and go.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It creates still an additional risk.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So I'm reminded of one of my favorite stories, as much as no one knows,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   about the fabled shredded wheat biscuit.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And there was an ad in the New York Times three or four years ago,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and all it has in the middle of the page is a shredded wheat biscuit.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I just put it up to the right side.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   This is for a full page at a time.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And it says, "This is the same biscuit we've made for 100 years.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It has the same ingredients.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It's made with the same care.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It's made with the same machinery.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And it tastes exactly the same and bites exactly the same."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   We put the "no" back in innovation.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And when it comes to, "I think our risk is over-innovating,"
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   that probably said to anybody who's progressive,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   as a typical statement by an aging veteran who thinks there's only one way to do things,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   is, "I am an aging veteran, and I do think there's only one way to do things."
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   What can I say?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I think that's probably enough, Mel, to open the session.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And we'll turn it over to you.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   You can give me a couple of minutes at the end.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Okay. We'll do that, Jack.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I know you like to respond to questions from people who are attending,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   so I'll call your name out.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Just raise your hand so Jack knows who he's speaking to.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   This question is from Dion.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He asks, "When Vanguard was developed as a mutual company,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   you thought other companies would follow.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   They haven't. Do you think they will?"
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Well, I'm not sure I really thought other companies would follow.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I didn't see how they could follow, and I don't think they will follow,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   because this is a business that is basically turned from a professionally managed,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   as it was when I came in, very small business,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   where, as I said yesterday, we sold what we made.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's a great marketing endeavor.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We make what we sell, and it's gotten bigger,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and largely because of public ownership, conglomerate ownership,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   of so many mutual fund management companies.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   About 80% of it has become an entrepreneur's dream,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   to start a mutual fund company and get rich.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And when you look at what's going on in the ETF world,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   exchange-traded fund world, we have a lot of entrepreneurs out there.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   They're in it simply to capture the next moment.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   They're in it to make money for themselves rather than clients.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   They're what Henry Kaufman called, I think I used this yesterday,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   financial buccaneers.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That's not good for the investor.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It's great for the entrepreneur, and they'll all make a lot of money,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   but their shareholders will not.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   So if you're making a lot of money and losing to performance all the time,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   to the index, you really can't change.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   If someone were to try and get their costs down,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I might have mentioned this briefly yesterday,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   get their costs down to Vanguard's expense ratio,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   which I think is a weighted number of about 15 basis points.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Well, take someone like Fidelity or T. Rose Price,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   or even Dodge and Cox, which are a little bit lower.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They're running at about 70 basis points on Woodford's expense ratio.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And if they destroyed the firm, eliminated marketing,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   fired the portfolio manager, started indexing,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   took away a little bit of Ned Johnson's 26 billion,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   it's a living.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   They could probably get their costs down from, say,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   70 basis points weighted to, let me say, 40.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And what's the point of that?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   There's still three times what our expense ratio is.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   They're not competitive, and they've given up all the purchases
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and stuff that they have, and they're all the way up doing things.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So it's going to be very hard.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And to visualize it even a little more clearly,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   there must be an innovator out there, not in the industry,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   saying, "Well, it looks like this industry has only one way to go.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   "It is the Vanguard way.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   "So I'm going to start a mutual company now.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   "I want to go out and raise capital to get into the business.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   "It's going to take"-- let me pull a number out of the air--
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   "$200 million to bust into the mutual fund business.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   "But how am I going to get that capital?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   "When someone gives me $200 million,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   "they're going to want a 15% minimum return on that capital.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   "So somehow they've got to make $30 million a year.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   "There's no way-- what a selling--
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "I've got this new IPO, this wonderful innovation,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   "but it's not going to produce any money for you at all.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   "Invest now." [laughter]
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So I don't know at what point competitive pressure
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   drives people into trying to protect their market share
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   and their cash flow when they're making money now.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And I think the honest answer to that is
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   the people in this business see that.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   They see that their future prospects
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   for significant earnings growth are gradually diminishing,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   but they're sitting on a great cash cow.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So this cash cow will generate money to the managers,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   money to the conglomerates, money to the public shareholders,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   but they will be diminishing.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And a lot of the companies that are now owned by conglomerates--
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   or self-owned Fidelity, for example--
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I would guess would be sold to some kind of a financial firm
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   within, say, five years for each work period.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I hate to make five-year predictions,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   because it's the least possible I'll be alive
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   to see whether they came true. [laughter]
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So I don't even see what's happening, and it's dramatic.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   You saw those charts yesterday.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They're doing 140% of the industry's cash flow.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But other people aren't going to concede,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   because they're still making a lot of money.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   They're happy there's enough money to keep everybody rich.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Capital-proof people, private company.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I think on every ranch in Montana--
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   well, maybe not quite every one.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I'm getting a little hyperbole here.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But it's going to be-- if it changes,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   it's going to be a very, very slow change.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Well, Jack, did you get any degree of satisfaction
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   when Fidelity tried to respond to Vanguard's index funds
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   when it was a Vanguard-- I mean, Spartan Funds out?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   You know you were responsible for that.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Yeah, well, the Spartan Funds are a pretty good--
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   first of all, be clear on the Spartan Funds.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   They're the only-- Fidelity is the only fund group,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   only fund sponsor in the entire industry
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   that has taken indexing seriously.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   They probably have-- is it 50 billion, 400 billion?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   About 150 or so.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   150 billion indexing.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I mean, it's just a drop in the bucket.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   But nobody else is anywhere near that.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And they charge kind of Vanguard-type prices.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Every once in a while, they try and undercut.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Doesn't seem to do them any good.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And then they go back to trying to make a little penny here
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   and there in their index fund.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But T. Rowe Price has an index business.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   They won't even tell you about it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Well, maybe they will.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I call them on the phone.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   But they're charging 23 basis points.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   23 basis points for an S&P 500 fund.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I think those directors have breached their fiduciary duty
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   to that fund.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And it just-- it doesn't work.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And I think it's--
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Morgan Stanley is even worse.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   There's a JP Morgan that charges 100 basis points.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   But they only charge 50 basis points
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and pay a 5% sales commission.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Only.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   By the way, I don't know how that word slipped out.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   So it's pretty much monopoly, except for BlackRock,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   which is doing quite well, and State Street, which is just
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   kind of hanging in there and has the most widely traded stock
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   in the world.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And that's Spider.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   But it's not going to be a very profitable business for them.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And they're pretty marginal in terms of cash flow.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   So it's basically come down to BlackRock and Vanguard.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And we're 25% of the ETF business
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   and 75% of the traditional index fund business.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And BlackRock is probably 5% of the traditional fund business,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   index fund business.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And they're bigger than we are.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   So they're probably 35% of the ETF business.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   So we'll be bigger than BlackRock.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And whether that will give me any satisfaction or not
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   is another question.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   There are ways to use our ETS that are satisfactory
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and important and valuable to investors.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But there seem to me to be a lot more ways to use them
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   in a very foolish way, not so much as Vanguard.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   But when you get-- we talked about this yesterday.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   You get this triple leverage.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And then you get somebody like Wisdom Tree
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   that had a decent idea at the beginning.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And it's now basically 100% of their cash flow
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   is in Japanese and European index funds,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   which you can trade to your heart's content.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And they're making a lot of money.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   But investors are only going to lose with that strategy
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   because nothing is good forever.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   So it's probably a little dumb to say I don't see
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   any real major competitor on the horizon.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But the mathematics that I always come back to--
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   and you've got to look at the incentives.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   You've got to look at the motivation.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And no matter what they do-- and I think this is
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   an important point-- if they can do anything,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   they want to compete with us.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   If you want to lose money, they can bring in that index fund
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   in four or five days at a point.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But what we really have going for us
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   is having had missionary zeal for indexing,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   basically not from day one.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   That was just an idea that goes into the investment
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   management system back in 1975.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   But from, say, 1980, 1985 on, particularly in the '90s,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   this zeal of perpetuating the value of indexing--
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   books, academic articles, the kind of things I've been doing.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Having somebody that's been dragged kicking and screaming
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   into the index business compete with someone
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   who has this missionary zeal, as if it's the Holy Writ,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   which is not a fair trade.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So we will sustain our position, I'm quite sure,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   unless we over-innovate.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And that would have such a small-- at the beginning,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   very small impact on what we do at Vanguard.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   So you don't require anybody in indexing to go somewhere else.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And I would not recommend that.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Nothing will be better, in my opinion.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Here's another follow-up question from Dion.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   In your wildest dreams, did you ever
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   think Vanguard would reach $3 trillion?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   No.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   But I did, I think, back in about 1989.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You could see, almost touch, the growth in our firm.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It was not going to slow down.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   So in 1989, it was not going to slow down very much.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   We had been growing at a 24% rate, annual rate.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   I mean, your assets double every three years.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   And we were doubling every three years, in fact.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And so I gave a speech to the crew
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   and to our internal staff previously called
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   "The Tyranny of Compounding."
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   You know, we always talk about the miracle of compounding.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   What I was trying to point out was a lot of tyranny to it.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   So I said, look, if we continue to grow through the '90s
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   at, say, an 18% rate or a 15% rate,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   because 24% is not sustainable, we're
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   going to be a trillion-dollar company in--
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I guess I said $800 billion in 1999.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And I would have gotten to this trillion
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   a couple of years later.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I probably should have repeated that exercise in 2000.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   But it would have come out the same way.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Our growth rate now is not 24%.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And it is not 18%.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It's not 15%.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Our cash flow growth rate is 5%, 5 and 1/2%.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   That's what cash flow does.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   You get a lot of inflation and growth
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   when you have very good markets.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Then you get a lot of deflation and growth
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   when you have bad markets.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So the way to look at a firm's growth rate
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   is cash flow as a percentage of assets.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And that's a very healthy growth rate.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Our GDP is growing at maybe 3% a year.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   So if you can grow at 6%, 5%, 5 or 6%,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   you're going to do just fine.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And of course, the dollars get so big.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   If you're dealing at 6% of the free trade,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   that's $180 billion.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And that's not too far from a little bit higher.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I think our cash flow for this year
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   is projected to be maybe $165 billion,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   something like that.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   There's a question about the bond duration.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And it says, do you think shorter duration bond funds,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   two to three years, would be a better choice
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   or stay with intermediates and heavier on corporate bonds?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Yes and yes.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Maybe I ought to amplify that.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Shorter duration is not a good bet, period.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Because the long run of the bond yield
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   is determined by the coupon.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And the long bond's yield is probably
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   a percentage point and a quarter, something like that,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   more in the intermediate term.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And two percentage points more in the short term.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Maybe even three.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So you will do better in the long bond.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   I just have been around so long.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I can't look at the numbers in the abstract
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   without saying how will people react
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   if interest rates go to 4%
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and that long-term bond drops by 40% back,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   which is roughly what would happen, very roughly.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And I think most people could not handle that.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   So no matter how good the long run is,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   we all have a little, we're influenced by the short run.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   The long run, God knows how long it is.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And if you have a retirement plan,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   you think, gee, I'd better do something about this.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I can't handle those losses.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   So it's the psychosomatic or behavioral effect
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   that worries me.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   So what I do myself is do,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   well, in my personal account,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   limited term uni and intermediate term uni,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   about half and half.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   So it gets me to a duration of probably
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   maybe four years, something like that.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And does that sound right, Mike?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   He's a good man.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Why don't you say exactly four?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   - And on my corporate, I have some mostly short term.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   We don't have limited term on the corporate side
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   and the index side.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And I'm a little down on this.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   I told you yesterday, I'm a total bond marketer.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I just think that's too much in the way of government,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   too much in some abstract way.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Can I prove that?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   No, I cannot prove it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And my big booster, David Swenson from Yale,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   thinks the only bond he should know
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   is the owner-government bond, Treasury bond.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And I think in the real world,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   that's just not enough return.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   The amount of risk, I'm talking real risk
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and not standard deviation, is quite small.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And you will do significantly worse
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   than the Treasury bond if you have corporates.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   The low default rate, maybe the corporate return
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   will be less than the coupon,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   but not enough to get it down to the Treasury rate.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   These are all expectations born of
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   too many years of experience, perhaps.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So I'd say yes, stay short duration.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Don't overemphasize government.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It troubles me that Treasuries and mortgage-backed,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Treasury-backed mortgage-backed
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   are 70% on the bond index.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And I just think that's too much.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And I've tried to get Vanguard to change it,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   but you can imagine what they think
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   when they get a letter from me saying,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   "You know, we're doing the bond thing wrong."
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I've started it that way.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   I don't need anybody to advise me.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I'm not sure I've looked enough,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   but the returns were so high,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   and the yields were so high
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   when I started that bond index fund,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   first bond index fund in 1986.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   It just seemed like a no-brainer.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And the yields were so high,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   the risk was, let me say, 7%, 8%.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   It didn't look so stark.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   When you get to 2% and 3%, that's a 50% difference.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So, or you look.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Lord Keynes said,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   you know, that's not what you said
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   the last time you talked to us.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And Lord Keynes responded,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   "When the bats change, I change my mind."
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   - Well, Jack, the comeback on that
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   from a lot of people is that
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   you take the risk on the equity side.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You want your bonds to be your safe harbor.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And there's nothing safer than treasuries.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And so why do you think that the 70%
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   in a government bond is too risky
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   when we're talking about
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   looking for balance in bad times?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   - Well, you have to think a little bit
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   about what that 70% is all about.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   You know, what is the proper ratio?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   What is the normal government bond,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   treasury, infinity bond for U.S. investors?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   We've got huge amounts of treasuries
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   that are owned by China and Japan.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And if you take them out of the program,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   you're gonna all of a sudden have bonds
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   that maybe, I don't know the exact number,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   but let me say 40% of the portfolio.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   What does it matter what China and Japan
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   are doing in terms of your portfolio?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So if you look at other portfolios,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   pension fund portfolios, for example,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   they're gonna be more like 35% government.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   I'm not saying that's right.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And I am saying, I'm making a judgment,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   which is a fragile judgment.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And like everything I've ever done
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   in my entire life, it could be wrong.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   But I have a feeling, and I think
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   it's a duty to express it.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   - I don't know about that.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   - Because the point is, just remember,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   an extra percentage point of return is priceless.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   - And I think you touched on this,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   but the question is from Cameron Bennett.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   If you care to share,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   what is your personal asset allocation and why?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   - Okay.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And believe it or not, I just actually changed it.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   For the first time in many, many years.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Let me go back a little bit in time with you
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   to an interview I had with Don Phillips
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   at Morningstar in, I think, the spring of 2000.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Could have been the fall of 1999.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Could have been a little bit later.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Right around the high of the stock market.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   And he asked me about my asset allocation.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And I said, well, right then,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   it was about 65% stocks, 35% funds.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I'm a conservative person.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And at that time, bond yields were 8%
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   and stock yields were 1%.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And I said to him, we looked this up in my interview
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   on the Morningstar board a little while ago.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And I said, you know,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   with stocks selling at 30 times earnings
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and yielding 1% and bonds yielding 8%,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   there's really not a chance in the world
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   that over the next decade,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   stocks will do nearly as well as bonds.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And then I asked myself rhetorically,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   then why am I holding any stocks at all?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And did something about it.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Very rare for me.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I just don't fuss around with changing.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   So I went from, in very rough terms,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   and I combined various retirement plan accounts,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   personal accounts, trust accounts,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   to get this number.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But I reduced, I wouldn't dare down the stock market.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I'm not smart enough to do that.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   That would have been called for then.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   You would have been smart to do it.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   But I'm just not smart enough to do it.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   So I reduced it in very rough terms
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and this is out of memory too,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   but I know where it came out.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I reduced my equities from about 65% of my portfolio
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   to about 40%.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And I was very happy with that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   That occurred in the '90s.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I didn't see any rebalance,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   but I did not rebalance at the end of the,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I'm sorry, at the end of 2010.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So I've stuck with that.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And gradually, because of changes
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   in the stock and bond market relative to one another,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I got to about 55% recent present position,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   55% equities, 45% bonds.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And these are combining taxable
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and retirement plan accounts.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   It's a crude number,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   but it will get the point across.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And not precise.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I don't do precise in any way.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And I decided at the beginning of the year,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   as I looked around this risky world out there,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   all the things that are going on,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   international conflicts, problems in the U.S.,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   the financial system,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   the kind of thing,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   the world's financial system,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   possibility of war,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   even more subtle things like
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the role of technology in price competition.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Everybody knows that technology
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   has changed the dimensions of price competition
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   in this country.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And it's been in favor of consumers,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and therefore against the interest of producers.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   The producers of the companies are making money.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And you see this in Walmart, for example,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and it's recent earnings.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So I put them all together,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and I thought I really want to go down
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   from 55% equities to about 45%.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And I found it very difficult to do
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   because in my personal account,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I have such gains on the index funds
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I bought 20 years ago.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   So I started to have a big tax burden,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and the amount of money involved
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   is probably a 27% or 28% capital gains tax.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And so I've got to say,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   "Well, if the market's going to go down,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "27% or 28%,"
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I'd admit to you,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I'd stop and do lower basis.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And I didn't think that was very likely,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   but I still did a little bit
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   in my personal account.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And that hedge fund got down to 50/50.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And then in my retirement plan account,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   we're still going to charity anyway,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   so I'm having a funny way of looking at things,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   but I thought if everything else failed,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   I could always draw money out of it,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   so I'll be able to consider it there.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I'll reduce another 5 percentage points,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and so forth and so on.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   So now I'm 45,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   45, 55, 45 in stocks,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and 55 in largely short-term
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and long-term bonds.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   So that's the story.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   - This is not an investment.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   We have a question,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   but it's about your management style
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   and your productivity.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's from Janet Heffernan.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   "James, how does your office management style
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   "contribute to your productivity,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   "and what time of the day do you find
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   "to be the most creatively productive?"
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   - Well, let me try the last one,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   which of course has no answer.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   What time of day do I find to be the most creative?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Well, I have this funny mind.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   I can attest to this.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I'm thinking of everything all the time.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   That's a lot of thought,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   and it's pretty true,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and I'll come in every morning
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   with a half-dozen new ideas,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and Mike and I will explore them
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   and look at what the data looks like.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   I mean, I trust my judgment,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   but I'd like to see data
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   on a whole variety of things.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   It's so far-fetched,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   you wouldn't even believe it.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I had one of them to give you an idea
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   where my mind is working.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I met with some Australians
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   when coming out of the galley,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   and I was gonna meet
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   the head Australian chief investment officer
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   at ANZ the next morning.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   So these fellows were sitting
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   with a Vanguard rep,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   and it happened to be a nice day.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   They were outside,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   and the outside portion,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   outside of our galley,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   is almost totally shady,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   but all the way over,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   coming back on the right side,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   there was this bright sun coming through.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And so I had a nice chat with these guys,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   and I said,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   "I don't know what you're doing
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   "sitting in the sun like this.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "I mean, it's the only--
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   "you're gonna get burned up or something."
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And then I said,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   "You know, it reminds me
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "of that quote from Shakespeare,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   "'I'm too much, he the sun.'"
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   As soon as I got back,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   the officer said,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   "Mike, check that one out for me.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   "See how right I was."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Mike failed me.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   So that night, I did it myself.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I Googled,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   "I'm too much, he the sun."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   It's Hamlet, Act I, Scene 3,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and contains,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   which I never knew
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   until I looked it up on Google,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   not just "too much in the sun,"
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Hamlet being,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   feeling he was too much
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   in the spotlight
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   after his father was murdered,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   but also his uncle
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   had murdered his father.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   You know the story.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And so it was a pun on
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   "I'm too much in the sun,"
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   S-O-N, from this guy.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So I learned a little bit.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Mike learned a little bit.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And when the Brit came in,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   I mean,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   the Aussie came in the next morning,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I let him have all barrels.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So, is this useful?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Is this productive?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   No, this is crazy.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   [laughter]
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   It's a sign of a mind
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   that didn't ferment perfectly.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And so,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I don't have a simple answer
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   to these questions.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   That thing's popped me.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I was sitting into it
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   in an investment company.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I'll give you another
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   more correlative example.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Many years ago,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   probably 20,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I was sitting in the audience
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   at the Investment Company Institute,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   a general membership meeting,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   a little bored,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and I started thinking.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And I thought, you know,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   we have a short term
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   municipal bond fund,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   an intermediate term,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   but the short term
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   is really too short.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   So I write down
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   a limited term meeting.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   The next day,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I came in the office,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   gathered my little staff around,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   probably four people,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and said we're going to start
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   a limited term municipal bond fund.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   That's how the process worked.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And, you know,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   it seems crazy.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   It seems stupid.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It seems arrogant.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Rarely do I consult with anybody,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   as I've told you
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   in a couple other contexts.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   But it all seemed to work out well.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And it says something,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I think,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   and I'm not sure about any of this,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   but something about the individual
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   compared to the consensus.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   I wanted to start
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   an insured municipal bond fund.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   So my friend Jeremy Duffield said,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   "We're going to do a survey
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "and see if anybody wanted one."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Nobody wanted
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   an insured municipal bond fund.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   I said, "We're going to start
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   "an insured municipal bond fund."
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   We had a lot of trouble
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   out in the Pacific Coast.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Washington State Power Authority
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   went bankrupt.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And I thought it would just be
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   a good idea in the abstract.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   So we started.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   It's been a big success.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Now, one of the great things
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   about a very small company
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   run by a dictator--
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   That's really the way it was.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I just--you know,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I don't know if anybody
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   will own up to this,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   but it was that way.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And there's something
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   to be said for that
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   if you're trying to do something
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   that no one has done before.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   When you get big,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   it's much more difficult to do.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You go through a process,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   process, process.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Judgment, as I mentioned,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   takes a back seat.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   So I guess it's just--
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I'm not sure it's healthy,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   by the way.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   At least some of my thought process
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   involves things other than investing.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I'm not sure enough.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And at least I try and keep
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   spending a good amount of time
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   with my family and mine.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I'm not sure I do
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   a great job on that,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   but I do an adequate one.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And I think everybody understands.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And so it's--
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   idea generation
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   is much more impulsive
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   and much less processed
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   than anybody can imagine.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   And, you know,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   you tell this to a consultant
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   who's going to tell you
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   some damn thing
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   like part of the expression.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   If you can measure it,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   you can manage it.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Of all the idiotic comments
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   ever made.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   I mean, is it all about
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   measuring things?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I mean, really?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   What about people?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   How do you measure character?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   How do you measure integrity?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   How do you measure loyalty?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Oh, we have some tested measures,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   they say.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I don't believe any of those measures.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And so I'm afraid
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   I'm showing you
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   reluctantly.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Well, not so reluctantly.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   My very worst side.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   - Jack,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   the number one topic
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   that we had on the forum,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   questions for you,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and from the members here
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   and from the board members,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   was about your thoughts and views
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   on international investing,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   which you talked about yesterday.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   But an interesting question on that
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   was from Lissy.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   I'm sorry,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   it's stated, of course.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It says, "If you were born
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   "on the same day in Japan
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   "and grew up as Jack Shigahara,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   "for example,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   "but you still had the same
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   "fervor for home country buys
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   "and equity investing as you do
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   "at Jack Vogel,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   "born and raised in America."
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   - Oh, that's so easy to answer.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Japan is not America.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   America has the most diversified economy
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   in the world,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   the greatest innovation,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   the greatest entrepreneurship,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   the greatest productivity,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   the greatest technology base,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   the greatest protections for shareholders,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   and ownership of private property
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   of any company in the world,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   not last but I will make
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   a possible exception
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   of Great Britain and Switzerland.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   These things are vital.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   These things underlie America.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   None of them underlie Japan.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I mean, they're barely getting out
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   of the imperial age over there.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   They have terrible demographics,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   as Gus mentioned this morning.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   They have a very structured economy
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   where you go up these little chairs
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and sing the company song,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   "Oh, My God."
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I'm vocalizing.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   But I'm actually having a good time.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   - This next question is from Brian.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   He says, "There have been recent studies
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   "that propose starting retirement withdrawals
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   "at a lower stock-bond mix
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "and later raising the stock-bond mix
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   "after you have avoided
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   "the stock market volatility risk
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   "in the initial phase of retirement.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   "What do you think about this proposal
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   "versus a more traditional
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   "get-more-conservative-as-your-age approach
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   "to the mix at the time
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   "of the stock market volatility risk?"
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   - Well, to begin with,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I think it's appropriate to challenge
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   the age-based kind of work.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And to be clear, I have never said
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   this is some kind of geometrical thing
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   that you do automatically.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I say it's a good place to begin.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Think about your age.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Think about your bond position
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   equaling your age.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Why?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Because the yield on bonds,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   the income yield,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   the interest rate on bonds is higher
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   than the dividend yield on bonds and stocks.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   So as you get older,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   you'll want more protection
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   and you'll want more income.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   So that kind of logic permeates the idea.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And that's a decent logic as far as it goes.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But the fact is, we know so little.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Rob Arnott,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   not exactly my dearest friend in the business,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   who runs the RAFI,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   R-A-F-I,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Research Association,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   R-A-F-I,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and does the smart beta kind of thing
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   with his fundamental indexing thing,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   which has not proved itself at all yet,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   but he's only had 10 years.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   I did not have to say that.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   But I don't think there are easy answers.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And I do think,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and I struggle a lot with this.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Now, intellectually,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   I do think there's a difference
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   when I started talking about that
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   and bought yield for maybe 7%
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and stock yield for maybe 2%,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   not the extreme 50 or 2000.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   I do think we have to think to ourselves
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   that the idea is to get more income
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   by having bonds when you're older.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   And the dividend yield on stocks is 2.1%,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   and the best you can do
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   on a reasonable, high-quality bond portfolio
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   is maybe 2 3/4 or 3%.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   I think we have to challenge our assumption
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   that there's not a lot that's permanent in this field.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   I don't know how.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   I don't have the answer to that.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I don't know if we'll be able to change
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   the way we do our target date funds.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   But I'm a little suspicious,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and I wonder if those life strategy funds,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   just pick one and have a permanent ratio,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   is not a bad idea.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And then I would add this.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   What do we know about rebalancing?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   It's a little related to that.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And we know that it is an unwise thing to do
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   for a long-term investor,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   because when you rebalance,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   you're selling the higher-returning asset,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   usually common stocks,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and buying the lower long-term return asset, bonds.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   So the more you rebalance, the less wealthy you do,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   compared to just hanging on to the stocks
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   and keeping a higher and higher position.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And just leaving the bonds
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   in the lower return,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   the smaller and smaller portion of the portfolio.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   That's not a mantra for me.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It's something that we all want to think about.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And times change, conditions change, interest rates change.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   So basically the answer is there is no answer.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   But I do think that the target date approach
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   is a reasonable approach.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I think it should be compared to the life strategy approach,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   which is a firmly conservative growth income objective,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   serious objective.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Probably, I don't even know,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   but 30% equities, 50% equities, 70% equities,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   or something like that, maybe even a little higher,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   is another way to do it.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   There's no guarantee in any of this.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   There is a behavioral element,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   comfort level, if you will,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   that if you get older,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   you know, I know this feeling.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I didn't even talk about this
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   when I talked about the difference
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   between an older age income, for example,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   and lower risk.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   But there's also this human factor.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   You know, we get a little bit crotchety and nervous
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   when we get old.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   I don't, but everybody else does.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   - We're talking just on the life strategy funds
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   and the target date funds.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Do you have any idea, when an investor looks,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   let's say a retiree looks,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   and they're looking, thinking,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   being conservative and income,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   the life strategy income fund is 40% equity,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   or the life strategy target,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   the target date income fund is 30% equity.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Do you have any idea why Vanguard
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   has the same income in portfolios
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   that are 10% more in equity?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   - No.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   I started those funds,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and I didn't know that.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   There is, in all my bragging
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   about the number of things that are on my mind,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   everything is off my mind.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   And I'd actually be very surprised at that.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I'd like you to check that out for me, okay?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Or do you know it's true?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   - I'm not sure.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   - That's the first time you've ever answered that.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   - I know what a strategy is.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   - So we'll check it out.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   It seems very funny.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Because at 10%,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   you know, if they get a 10 percentage point difference,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   and you multiply it by the expected stock return
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   and the expected bond return,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and it really doesn't change
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   your risk or your return very much
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   if you have 10% more left.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I think sometimes we're too darn mathematical.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   And it's basically,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   what are you comfortable with?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   What do the numbers tell you to do?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   How much do you think your risk is?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   How much money do you have at stake?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Someone has a huge amount of money at stake.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   It could be very different.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Someone's struggling for every penny,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   so they don't have to call on their kids
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   when they retire,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   or when they get 10 years into retirement.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   So none of this is easy.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And that's why anything that is too formulaic
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   kind of worries me.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   And yet, okay,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   gross return minus cost equals net return.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   That sounds kind of formulaic to me.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   So I guess what I'm saying is
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   anyone that uses my formula is okay,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   but anyone that uses other people's formulas
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   probably ought to be careful.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   I am trying to make, by the way,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   a serious point there,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   and that not everything can be converted to numbers.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Read my book called Don't Count On It.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   - Jack, I may have misquoted those numbers.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I think I was trying to be conservative
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   versus the target date retirement.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   - Well, see, that would depend on which retirement.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   - Right.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   The target retirement income fund
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   is the final fund of everything.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   - But you'd be picking a particular
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   target date retirement age
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   to get that 30%.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   I don't know what that is.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   - No, but all funds end up
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   in the target retirement income fund,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   which is maybe 30%.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   - The target retirement doesn't have
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   an income fund as such.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   It's just a gradual scaling of the equity ratio.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   - Yeah, but I think they call it
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   the target retirement income fund.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   - Well, they should stop that.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   We'll check those out.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   - We'll move on, because I'm totally
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   in trust memory of those two.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Question from Nisi.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   What do you make of predictions
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   that investment returns going forward
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   will be lower than we're used to?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   I think we all know your answer to that.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Do you think that they will
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   be lower than normal for longer?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   - Let me say a couple things about that.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   When you look at things in 10-year average,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   and let me use my central number,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   which is the 6% future return
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   for the bottom line stock.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Start with the knowledge certain
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   that it's not going to be 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   It's going to be plus 20 and minus 40,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   and it's going to jump all over the place.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   So that in itself kind of gives a lie
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   to thinking about things at the time continuity.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   The reality is that this could all be,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   and Gus kind of hinted at this, I think,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   or maybe you came close to hinting at it.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   We got a good solid 40% market decline,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   and all would be well.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   And if you think about it for a minute,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   and I don't think too many of you here
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   are in this category, certainly I'm not,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   but if you're building a fund for retirement,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   pray for a 40% market decline,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   not just Sunday, but Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Thursday, Friday, and Saturday,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   because you'll be investing at lower prices for years.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   So we have this kind of funding bias
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   that market highs, rising markets are good
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   and falling markets are bad,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and the fact of the matter is
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   that everybody must know that rising markets
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   are good for sellers and bad for buyers,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   and falling markets are good for buyers
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   and bad for sellers.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   There's this eternal equation,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   and nobody can challenge that anymore
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   than they can challenge the growth of retirement.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Just so you get the full point,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   finance qualities of debt retirement.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   - Jack, you said, the first two words you said
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   in your opening remarks the other night
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   were "Taylor, where am I?"
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   I have a message for you from Taylor.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   It says, "Dear Jack, no one in the mutual fund industry
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   "has a greater combination of character,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   "practical experience, knowledge, inventive genius,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   "wisdom, perseverance, management ability,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   "literary ability, kindness, modesty,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   "and a desire to help others.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   "What are your most important words of wisdom
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   "to give to your own mind?"
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   - Well, first of all, my wife would agree with all that.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   She said, "Who's he talking about?"
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   As always, my wife is right.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   We'll be celebrating our 60th wedding anniversary
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   next September, and so I don't want to do anything
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   to disturb her, I don't argue about that.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   I think advice really is simple.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Look at investment principles,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   know what the game is about,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   understand where the sources of return,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   it's one of my big themes, promote your bonds and stocks,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and just try and figure out how much risk you can tolerate.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   You know, it's easy to put in a questionnaire,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   "What would you do if the market went down 50%?"
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And people say, "I guess it wouldn't bother me at all."
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Well, that's a bare-faced lie.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   It's easy to contemplate 50% decline and say,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   "Fine, I know it's gonna come back."
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Then it goes down 50%, you're on your way out the door.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   So it's behavior, it's who you are,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   and always be who you are.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Life is too short to be anybody else.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   But take into account the fundamentals.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   You know, listen to what people like me are telling you
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   that are reasonably unbiased about future market returns.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And conservative, I would always lean to the conservative,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   because you will then be in the awful position of over-saving,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   which is so much better than being in a position of under-saving
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   when that great retirement date comes.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   And then I would add, and I'll throw a little anecdote here,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   that I had this expression,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   "Don't peek, don't peek, P-E-E-K,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   "at your 401(k) envelope when it comes in,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   "or your IRA envelope when it comes in,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   "every month in your anecdote.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   "Just throw the darn thing in the wastebasket."
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   And keep doing that until you retire.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   And when you retire, open the envelope.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   But be sure and have a cardiologist.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   [laughter]
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Because you're going to have a heart problem,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   and you won't believe what you've accumulated.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And the anecdote part of this, and every once in a while,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   you find out, yes, in spite of the odds,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   somebody is actually reading this stuff,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   and somebody is getting the point.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   And I've been doing that for a long time,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   and I got a letter from an airline.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Todd was just retired, not so long ago.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Long letter, and a couple of long follow-ups.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   And his first letter began, "Dear Mr. Bogle,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   "I have just opened the envelope."
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   It gave me such gratification.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   - You know, it's interesting,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   because the next question was from Backpacker,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   and it says, "You've said that investors
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   "shouldn't peek into the portfolio here.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   "Say once."
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   I believe your exact words were, "Don't peek, don't peek,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   "don't peek."
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   "This helps them save a course,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   "and when they look at their portfolios
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   "right before retirement,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   "they'll be floored by how much they've saved.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   "How does that work in practice, though?
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   "Don't investors need to monitor their portfolio
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   "to rebalance, maintain the aging bonds,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   "and watch what's wrong?"
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   - Well, you've got to distinguish
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   between the real world
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   and the hypothetical world.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   I mean, you know, read "The Tortoise and the Hare."
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   It's a great story,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   and it's a better story for an investor.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   But it's overdrawn, it's hyperbolic,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   and none of us are tortoises
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   or hares.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   So the question is, how much of us is a tortoise,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   and how much of us is a hare?
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   You read these things about how all people are divided
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   into two classes.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   I'm looking at 220 people or something here,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and not one of them.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   I mean, this group is divided into 220 different classes.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   And so,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   you have to recognize people's individuality,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   and you have to recognize
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   the difference,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   and I'm not sure I'm good at this, by the way,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   the difference between kind of
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   a little hyperbole to make a point
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   and hoping
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   that people understand
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   it's like an ideal
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   or a fable or a moral
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   that you adjust around
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   to deal with who you are yourself.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   And that scene is
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   a little bit like one of my commencement speeches
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   in one of my books.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   I guess it's in
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   "Don't Count On It."
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   "If this above all
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   that I own itself
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   be true, then thou
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   canst not be false to any man."
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Shakespeare probably would have said, "Man over man or woman."
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   And that's also
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   from Hamlet, for those who care.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   And so,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   the idea
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   that there's some answer,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   you know, young people,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   crew members will often come to see me
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   and say, "I'd love to come and meet you."
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   And I do my best to accommodate them.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   And they basically,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   if I can simplify the conversation,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   say, "Okay, what's the secret?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   What's the secret?"
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   And you get to be
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   the head of a $3 trillion company
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   or whatever we were when I last ran it.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   And I say,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   "Look,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   you have a lot of assets
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   that I do not have,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   and I have a lot of liabilities
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   that I do not have.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   We're different people.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Every person's secret is different.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   So just learn what you can.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Watch others. Watch what they do.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   See what you can identify. Do what you can.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   But for God's sake,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   be true to yourself."
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And so, you know, I don't have
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   this kind of Confucian
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   sort of wisdom.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   But I do have a certain kind of wisdom
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   that calls for perspective.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   And maybe
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I shouldn't use the word "modesty,"
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   but I'll say "modesty" in the extremity
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   of my views on a human being.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   And so
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   we all struggle on different
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   family circumstances. I mean, they're so different.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Everything is so different.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   When someone says, "I can tell you
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   what the rule is,"
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   the rule is there is no rule.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I mean, there's common sense.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   There's mathematics.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   There's what stage of life
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   you're at.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   It's family.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   What your objectives are
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   to leave money to your children
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   or make enough money for yourself
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   to have a comfortable retirement.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   There are abstract goals,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   but ultimately are measured
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   with a dollar sign and a certain number of digits.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   So I know, you know,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   I'd love to have some really...
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Do we have a "why" sentence, Mike?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Could you give me a "why" sentence
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   that I should give you?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Stay the course. That's good.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   This next one is from Jane.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Since Vanguard has publicly
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   maintained that HFT
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   high frequency traders are needed
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   as market makers,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   given that Fidelity and other large fund companies
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   are starting their own dark pool,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   why isn't Vanguard joining them
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   to potentially get the best price
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   for the customer?
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Is there a disadvantage of placing trades
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   in an internal dark pool first
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   before going to external exchanges?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Well, that's actually
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   particularly in this day and age,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   kind of out of my pay grade.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   I don't know exactly how we do it.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   The idea that we are doing other than best execution
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   and maximum shares volume
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   at a given price or close to a given price
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   is, I think, eternal.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   And that has to be the rule
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   for a firm like Vanguard.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   And the extent to which we use dark pools,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I imagine we use them, but I don't know.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   And how you even define
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   a dark pool is a little bit funny
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   in itself. So I just have to bagel off.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   It's the first question I've been asked
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   in two days, so I really have to bagel off
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   the answer.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   This is an interesting question.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   It's not
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   investing related, but I've always wondered
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   why Mr. Moto decided to keep
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Vanguard headquarters in Malibu,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   as opposed to moving to one of the
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   money center cities.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Well, the answer
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   to that is pretty easy.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I'll give you a little anecdote to go
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   with this, too, which very few people know.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And that is
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   for a whole lot of reasons, including
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   Philadelphia taxes. We were in Philadelphia
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   at Wellington from
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   1928 to
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   1974.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   And early in '74, we decided
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   we could get better real estate
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   prices,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   better workforce,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   eliminating Philadelphia
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   wage tax,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   and therefore being able to recruit
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   a better workforce
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   on a financial basis.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   And so we moved out to
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   what do we call it?
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Right around the corner
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   from the Chester Brook building we had.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And a small building.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And then when the company blew up,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   it was sold.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   So we then built the building
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   in Chester Brook, and we got a little bit bigger.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   And that was back in '74
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   was the first one, then we moved to
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Chester Brook in 1983.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   So we got out of Philadelphia, number one,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   primarily for tax reasons.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Even when we got out of Philadelphia,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   we had a big problem with the Pennsylvania
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   taxes.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   They had a very peculiar way of taxing investment
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   companies that was finally
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   unacceptable to us.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   So we could have moved to a county without
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   any personal property taxes, say,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   I'm not sure what the county is,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   a county maybe where Harrisburg is,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   and solve the whole problem.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   But nobody wanted to go to Harrisburg.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   So I decided we would change the law.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   People think big.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   So I got a really good lobbyist,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   former Governor Ernie Fine.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   And when I say a good lobbyist,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   I mean someone that is totally
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   above board.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Not a contingent fee guy, we pay them
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   the normal legal fees.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Great contacts out there.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I said to the people, we're going to have to leave the state
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   unless they change the law.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   And within about a year, oh by the way,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   I should tell you, this will also tell you
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   more about me if you want to know.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   On Pennsylvania, there were
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   probably six companies in Pennsylvania,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   smaller than we were, but
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   some of them were decent sized.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   And they said, we'll work with you on this,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   we'll help pay the bills. And I said,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   no you will not. We're going to do this
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   all on our own, happy to pay the bills,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   but I don't want anybody mucking up the
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   process around here.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   So we did it all by ourselves, and they got the benefit too.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   We then got a unanimous
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   passage of a bill that eliminated
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   these taxes in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Did away with the plaque
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   in probably 1976
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   roughly.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   And
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   the unanimous,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   the Senate unanimous in the House
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   was signed by the Governor, it was then Dick Thornbury.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   And
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   all of a sudden the tax problem is gone.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   The taxes would have cost us
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   now about 10 basis points
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   a year. So add that
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   to 17 basis points of expense ratio
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   over 15, and you get the same
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   25 basis points. It was just
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   unacceptable, it would not be something the fiduciary
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   could afford to do. So
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   when all else fails,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   change the law.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   I have a follow up question to that.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Do you feel that being in
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Melbourne, as opposed to
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   one of the money centers,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   helped to keep the distinct culture
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   of Vanguard?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Well,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   I guess it
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   helps in a way.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   First, we have
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   a much better
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   ability to draw people from the community,
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   from the counties around
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Vanguard, counties and towns
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   around Vanguard,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   and don't have to deal with the problem of Philadelphia
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   population, which is basically
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   a measure of far too much poverty.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Far too much poverty.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   And you get,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   and I'm sad to say this,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   a better workforce, although
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   it's still possible for you to get a workforce from
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Philadelphia, and we still do it. They come out in the
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   train. Mike comes out in the train
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   himself most of the time.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Philadelphia is president now.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   And so I think
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   we have a better workforce. Whether it's some intellectual,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   are we
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   free from the influence of Wall Street,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   whether you're an indexer,
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   free from the influence of Wall Street anyway.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   So I'd
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   say we could have gone to
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Harrisburg. We could be
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   in, I don't know,
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Pittsburgh.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Oh God, no.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Sorry about Pittsburghers.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   [laughter]
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   And I think
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   being outside the city is
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   kind of, it sounds great, but then
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   you're away from all that funny influence and all that
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   trading blah blah. I don't think it matters
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   that much. And so what keeps
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   us going is not necessarily being in
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Malvern, or as I still say, Valley Forge.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   What keeps us going is
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   two great innovations.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   One is mutual structure,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   which is easier to do in Pennsylvania
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   once the laws have changed.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   And the idea of indexing.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   And any firm that has done that, like we
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   had done, I don't think it would really matter
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   whether they were in Syracuse,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   an interesting place to be, I guess,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   or not.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   I think it's mostly
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   a workforce issue. We have really
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   good people working
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   here. I was really
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   impressed last night,
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   other than
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   114 selfies
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   by actual
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   talent
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   with the wonderful young people that we
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   recruit here. I think it helps them in that way,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   workforce way.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   I'm not even sure of that.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   In fact, this next thing is
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   not a question, it's more a nice comment
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   from Miriam.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   And I want to pass this along. It says,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   "I just received my beautiful hardcover
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   2015 edition of John Bogle
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   on investing the first 50 years
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   for Walnut Publishing.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Martin's dedication states,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   and especially those Bogle heads
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   of the internet, that dedicated
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   and loyal cadre of Vanguard.org
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   to give me strength to carry on my mission.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   It's incredible to think
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   that we, as foreign members, give him
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   the strength to carry on his mission.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   Perhaps we could thank him for his dedication
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   to his national land
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   and work with Bogle heads that meant to him."
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   And I really reject that
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   dedication.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   [applause]
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   I probably should not,
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   but that hasn't stopped me yet.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   A little anecdote.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   And that is, there was a
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   Bogle head who died
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   before the reunion came.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   He had a farm out in Valley Forge.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   The Bogle heads came out there
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   for, I guess, Bogle Heads 2 or 3.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   2.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   And so it was easy for me to come out there.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   People are still telling stories
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   about my taking home a half a sandwich I didn't finish.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   [laughter]
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   By now.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   And then the next year
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   we decided to invite him to
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   come to the campus
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   for a visit.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   And I was told, "You would not be allowed on campus."
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   And, uh,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   I won't even get into that.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   That seemed ridiculous to me.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   I didn't know quite what to do about it.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   I was trying to figure out what to do about it.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   But I truly would have done something
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   if Kevin was with me.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   And we made signs
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   welcoming the Bogle heads.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   He was standing out there in the driveway
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   to welcome you in.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   "They're not coming in here."
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Well, it happened that
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   the day before you came
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   there was an article in the Philadelphia Enquirer
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   about the Bogle heads.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   They had photographs and that kind of thing.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   And all of a sudden
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   management changed its mind.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   They said, "Okay, they can come in."
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   And they said, "However,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   we don't really like the fact
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   that you blackmailed us into this."
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   [laughter]
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   They thought I had placed the article.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   I wish I had that power.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   But I did not.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   And did not.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   But then we had a really nice meeting.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   And then the next year we got a little bit of religion.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Hal was kidding me about this a few minutes ago.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   A little bit of religion.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   And we got little paper cups
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   with popcorn in them.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   It was delicious, wasn't it?
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   And then the next year, I think it was mainly Glenn Reeves.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   One of the...
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   fairly new at Vanguard.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   He said, "Come on, let's welcome them.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   They're important to us.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Let's give them the full treatment.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   And boy, I saw last night...
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Aren't you overdoing it a little bit?"
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   [laughter]
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   [inaudible]
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   So that little turnaround
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I think shows you
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   not what I think, because everybody knows
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   what I think about all of you,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   but what the company thinks is an important asset.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   I imagine we had some reader there
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   at Vanguard
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   who reads your comments full-time
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   because you're a valuable resource.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   When something goes wrong
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   and you put it up on your board, we listen.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   And I still get letters from shareholders.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   I still write back
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   handwritten letters to every single one of them.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   I have to pass them on to somebody else
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   because I don't have any...
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   I can't get access
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   to our shareholder records
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   to find out who's right or who's wrong.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   But I give them personal attention.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   And I think the biggest
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   single thing we've got to be careful
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   of here is to make sure
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   we don't forget the coin of grace
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   I've used 10,000 times.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Be honest to God down
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   to earth human beings
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   who are our clients and who are
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   our crew members
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   who serve those clients,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   each one with its own hopes
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   and fears
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   and financial goals.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   And we don't forget... I was up at Harvard
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   Business School, and one of the wise acres
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   in the class said a few years ago,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   "What's all this about human beings?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Why do you have a chapter or section
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   in your book
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Common Sense
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   on Mutual Funds on human beings?
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   What's that all about?"
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   And I said, "You can quite say it this way.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   Look, pal, who do you think
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   we're investing all that money for?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   You know, it's not some big abstract
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   probably a trillion dollars.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   It's people.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Humans with their own needs.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   And if we ever forget that,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   either with respect to our crew
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   or with respect to our clients,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   that would be all of the
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   things that take a long time to happen.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   All of them are the kids of death.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   So how do you keep humanity in the picture?
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   You know, I'm doing my best
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   every day to do it.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   I may not be here forever,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   although sometimes I entertain
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   the contrary side of that proposition.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   Jack has to leave at 40 days.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   He wants to say a few words.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Okay, well,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   let me say very quickly.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   I don't think
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   I've ever had more fun
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   than Bogo Hits 14.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   You're all so gracious
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   and kind.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   So thoughtful of me.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   I won't comment about the selfies.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   I've done a little count,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   and one of you has not got a picture
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   of themselves with me.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   You will identify yourself.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   I'll meet you out in the lobby later on.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   So, it's just been a thrilling
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   experience, and last night
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   more and more bringing out and meeting
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   the wonderful young people that we have over there.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   And they sort of, in spite of the fact
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   that I don't even know how they recognize me,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   there's a lot of
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   hero worship and a lot of
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   appreciation and a lot of joy
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   from these young people about the situation
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   in which they find themselves at this stage
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   of their career. So this has been a wonderful
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   time. I want to thank you for that. Number two,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   I thank you for
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   [pause]
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   [laughter]
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   my walking stick.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   And, uh,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   the motto when we gave it to Jack is
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   "If you can lean on us, we support you."
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   [laughter]
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   And, uh, so that's
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   a nice touch, and I certainly want to
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   thank Mel for his leadership
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   of this thing, and also
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   this whole group of you. And not only
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   Mel and Marlene, but
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Ted and Linda, Paul and Linda
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   I should say, Gail Cox, of course
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   Gail Cox, uh, Mel and
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Kathy, and I think
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   maybe
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   Ed and Patty were so great.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Uh, you know, you're kind of
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   becoming old pals, and
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   uh, we get together once a year.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   It's a little bit, a little
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   bit like a family holiday.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   And, uh, that's a big part
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   of me doing this over and over again
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   for years. And, uh,
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   so,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   thank you all
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   from the bottom of my heart.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   [applause]
