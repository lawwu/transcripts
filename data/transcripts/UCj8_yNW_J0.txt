[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   Good Monday, and thank you for listening to the podcast. As Christians, we love the good news that
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.720]   Jesus Christ has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:25.680]   2 Timothy 1.10. This salvation is a great gift to us, but it's not the greatest gift. The gospel
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:36.000]   is precious to us because the greatest prize of the gospel is that we get God. We get God.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.640]   He becomes our Father. He becomes our all-satisfying Friend. He becomes our Protector
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:55.680]   and our Provider. He is the prize of the gospel. We saw that back in APJ's 1079 and 1604, a precious
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.440]   point that we will return to next time on Wednesday, actually, in APJ 1934. But first,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.880]   today's question, because with such wealth in the good news, surely we should find ourselves
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.200]   willing and eager to share this gospel with everyone we come into contact with, right?
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.840]   Well, no, we often don't. Gospel opportunities arise when we say nothing, and so we're left
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.640]   inside a tension of our own making, claiming to love something that we hesitate to speak about
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.320]   with others, and bringing into question the authenticity of our own love. If we truly
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.560]   loved the gospel of Jesus Christ, why wouldn't we more eagerly share it? That leads to our
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   question today from a candid and anonymous young man who simply asks this. Pastor John,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.040]   here's my honest and straightforward question to you. Will I go to hell if I never evangelize,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   not even once? First, let me agree with this young man that there is such a reality as hell,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:24.480]   and people really do go there. It is the righteous judgment of God, and no one in the Bible spoke
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.320]   of it more often than Jesus. For example, he said to the Pharisees, "You serpents,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.920]   you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?" Matthew 23, 33.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.480]   And the apostle John spoke of the one who will—and this is probably the most vivid description of
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:01.440]   hell in the Bible from Revelation 14, 10, and 11—"They will drink of the wine of God's wrath,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.360]   poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.800]   in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb, and the smoke of their
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:24.960]   torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night." That's a horrible description,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.760]   both for its length and its intensity. So the question is not—the reason I just underlined
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.400]   that is because I think there are people who would hear a question like his and say,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.920]   "He's so stuck on that fundamentalist myth of hell." The question is not based on some tradition
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.120]   or some marginal sectarian belief. The reality of hell is terrible. It belongs to the core
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.920]   message of what the gospel of Christ saves us from. Now, back to the question. Will I go to hell
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   if I never evangelize? And the answer to this question goes something like this.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.320]   Nobody goes to hell for any particular thing that he does or does not do.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.480]   Rather, a person goes to hell because the things that he does or does not do
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.480]   give sufficient evidence that he's not trusting in Jesus Christ as his treasured Savior,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:47.120]   treasured Lord. We are saved by faith, not because of deeds (Ephesians 2.8 and 9).
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:56.400]   We are justified by faith, not by works of the law (Galatians 2.16). If we believe on Jesus,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   we have eternal life. We don't come into judgment. We've passed from death to life (John 5.24).
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   But faith is the kind of experience, it's the kind of reality in the mind and the heart
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.840]   that gives rise to love for other people. Galatians 5.6, "In Christ Jesus, neither
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.400]   circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything but only faith working through love."
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:34.560]   Saving faith is the kind of thing that works through love. Or as James says, "Faith,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.840]   if it does not have works, it's dead." It's not real. It's not saving faith.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:49.120]   Therefore, people are not in hell simply because they did bad things or did not do good things.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.360]   They are in hell because the things they did or did not do confirmed the rebellious,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.760]   unbelieving condition of the heart. Matthew 15.19, "Out of the heart come evil thoughts,
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.120]   murder, adultery, sexual morality, theft, false witness, slander, and so on."
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.960]   So back to our question, "Will I go to hell if I never evangelize?" The question now becomes,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.520]   "What is the condition of the heart that does not evangelize?"
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:33.760]   There are some passages of Scripture that connect being a Christian with the use of the mouth
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:42.080]   for Jesus' sake. 1 Peter 2.9, "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.720]   a people of God's own possession, that you may proclaim." This is why you are chosen,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.040]   why you're a Christian. "That you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.800]   darkness into his marvelous light." We are saved from darkness to light to make the excellencies
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.600]   of God known, to declare them. Or Romans 10.9, "If you confess with your mouth
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.120]   that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you'll be saved."
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.880]   Why would that be? Why would it be the confession with the mouth that leads to salvation?
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.600]   And Jesus gives part of the answer in Mark 8.38 when he says, "Whoever is ashamed of me in my
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.160]   words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:46.240]   in the glory of his Father with the holy angels." So the question is, what does our silence mean?
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:54.880]   Does it mean that we don't see or savor the excellencies of the one who called us out of
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:02.320]   darkness? Does it mean that we don't really believe that Jesus is Lord? Does it mean that
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:12.560]   we are deep down ashamed of Christ? These are the real questions. The question is, why am I silent?
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   That's the question. Why? Maybe the most helpful thing—and I want to be helpful here, I don't
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.360]   want to just indict—the most helpful thing I can do for our young friend is to make a few
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:33.120]   practical suggestions for moving forward. He's young, and he's got time. He's not consigned like
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.400]   a 90-year-old who looks back and says, "I've never done this." First, remember that the word
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   "evangelize" is an English word built on the Greek word euangelizima. You can even hear "evangelize"
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.280]   and "euangelizima," they sound the same, which means "speak good news," especially the good news
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.360]   of what Jesus has done in dying for our sins and rising again and forgiving us through faith.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:10.560]   The word "evangelize" or "euangelizima" is not limited to speaking the good news to unbelievers.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:21.920]   Let that sink in, young fella. It includes speaking to believers. So Paul says in Romans 115,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:29.440]   "I am eager to preach the gospel," evangelize, same word, "to you, you Christians who are in Rome."
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:38.080]   Now, that's a great place to start. Speak of Christ to fellow Christians. Tell the good news
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:45.600]   to Christians. Tell them what you saw in your devotions this morning. Tell them a good promise
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.680]   that's been helping you through some tough times recently that Christ made to you and bought for
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.080]   you with his blood. Tell them what God has done in your life, what he's doing. Remind Christians how
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.280]   precious Jesus is to you and ought to be to them, how the good things that come into our lives are
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:12.720]   owing to his death, Romans 8:32. And if you're too young—I don't know what age we're dealing with
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:20.240]   here—if you're too young and inexperienced to, say, teach a class, a Sunday school class, or
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:28.320]   have a small group or young people, then volunteer to be an assistant in a class, say of children
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:37.600]   or small group, and ask the teacher or the leader if from time to time you could give a witness to
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.200]   the young people or the children or the small group of what Christ did in your life, how he
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.040]   saved you, and what he's been doing in your life since you've been following him, what you're
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:57.520]   learning from him. Now, I make those suggestions about evangelizing fellow Christians, telling them
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:07.360]   the good news that they already love, because I think that's the normal way we make ourselves
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:14.640]   ready to speak more naturally to unbelievers. We should grow up talking of Christ and his value
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.120]   and his goodness to believers. Here's one last suggestion. If you have a friend who is an
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:30.720]   unbeliever and you find it awkward turning normal conversations to Jesus, consider this.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:40.320]   Just ask him point blank if you could have lunch together or whatever you do to hang out one-on-one
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.040]   and that you'd love to have a conversation with him about some important things you've been
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.000]   thinking about, praying about, and you'd like to hear some of his thoughts and tell some of yours.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.320]   In other words, just ask him for permission to share what means the most to you. That really
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:09.840]   is easier than turning a movie conversation to Christ. I think one of the reasons it is so
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.760]   difficult to evangelize in our day is that our conversations are almost never serious.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:24.160]   It's very difficult to take a lighthearted movie or music or athletic conversation and say,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.560]   "Oh, by the way, there's some life and death issues to talk about." It doesn't work. It's
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.480]   the transition that just seems so weird. So you've just got to be real with people and say, "Can we
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.840]   just have a serious moment?" But in the end, the great issue is what's going on in your heart.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:50.800]   Deal with Jesus. This is my closing encouragement. Deal with Jesus as a real person. Go down deep
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:58.560]   with him in his word as you pray over it and apply it to your life. Be utterly real with Jesus
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:07.360]   until he becomes very precious to you. And then when you speak of him, you will feel real
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.760]   because you are real. Very helpful, practical steps to get started here in sharing the gospel
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   for the first time. And by talking of Christ and his value and his goodness to believers,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.520]   very practical first steps here. Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for joining us today.
