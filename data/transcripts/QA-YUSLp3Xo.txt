[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   [Intro Music]
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.880]   Colossians 1, 15-23 is a majestic text. In fact, it's my favorite text in the Bible.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.280]   But Colossians 1, 20 is notoriously challenging and it has baffled and befuddled Bible interpreters
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.320]   and theologians for many centuries. The question comes in to us today from a listener named
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.320]   Heather. "Hello Pastor John, I have a question about Colossians 1, 20 about Christ reconciling
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.520]   to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.120]   cross. For the unsaved and for the fallen angels, how are they reconciled to Christ?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.880]   Pastor John, what would you say to Heather?"
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.480]   I just did a look at the book session on this very question recently. So let me see if I
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   can sum up my argument for Heather here on APJ. It really matters because it's a question
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.920]   about what's commonly called universalism, or the teaching that in the end, everyone,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.720]   even demons, will be saved. There's no hell, there's no eternal punishment. Sooner or later,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.600]   even if it takes a thousand years through some kind of purgatorial discipline, everybody
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.200]   gets saved in the end. That's what some people say this text, this text, Colossians 1, 20,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.480]   supports. And let me read it. "For in Christ, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.920]   and through him to reconcile to himself all things, to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.360]   whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross." The question is,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.960]   when Paul says, "All things, all things will be reconciled to God through Christ," does
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:15.560]   all things mean every unbeliever who has ever lived, including Satan? And my answer is no.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   But rather, all things is a comprehensive term referring to the new heavens and the
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.880]   new earth, where absolutely everything, all things that exist in the new heavens and the
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   new earth will have been reconciled to God through the blood of Christ. But that there
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:47.640]   is over against that new heavens and new earth an outer darkness, an awayness, an other.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:57.120]   There is a reality excluded from the new creation. There is hell that's outside God's new creation,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.840]   where impenitent believers and demons suffer justly forever. Now, here are four passages
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:16.440]   that point me to this understanding of Colossians 1, 20. Number one, 2 Thessalonians 1, 7-9,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   and these teach me that Paul just doesn't believe in universalism. "At the second coming,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.200]   the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.560]   vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:43.440]   Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.800]   of the Lord and from the glory of his might." Now, that passage shows that Paul does not
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.080]   believe all will be saved. He believes that there will be an eternal destruction for those
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:09.880]   who disobey the gospel. Paul does not believe that everyone will be reconciled to God. Everyone
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   will not be saved. And he says that they will suffer a punishment away, away from the presence
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.160]   of the Lord and of his glory. And that points, I think, to what I mean by outside of the
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.640]   new heavens and the new earth. Now, this next text, this is number two, supports that, I
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.160]   think. Matthew 8-11, Jesus says, "Many will come from east and west and recline at table
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.880]   with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:52.440]   be thrown into outer darkness," outside the kingdom, away. "In that place there will be
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:00.240]   weeping and gnashing of teeth." So what Paul calls "away from the Lord's glory," Jesus
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.360]   describes as that place which will be outside of the established kingdom of God at the end,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.000]   outside of God's saving rule, outside the place where all is reconciled, the place of
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.320]   outer darkness. Third, remember in Colossians 1-20 that these all things that are going
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.720]   to be reconciled are things on earth and things in heaven. Now, why doesn't Paul say all things
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.120]   under the earth, all things in heaven, all things on earth, all things under the earth?
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:47.760]   Because he uses those three in Philippians 2-10, where he says, "At the name of Jesus,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:56.160]   every knee will bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth." And that phrase is not
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:04.080]   used in Colossians 1-20. Now, when he uses it in Philippians 2-10, he's not saying there's
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.640]   universal salvation, but universal submission. Willingly or unwillingly, every knee is going
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:19.000]   to bow, including the demons under the earth. Could it be, could it be that Paul did not
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.320]   use the phrase "under the earth" in Colossians 1-20 because those under the earth will not
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.480]   be reconciled to God? They're not part of the all things. They will have to submit,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.160]   but they will not be reconciled. Now, here's my last text, and a very, very important observation,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:49.320]   I think. This is a principled analogy. I'm thinking of Isaiah 66-24. Those are the very
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.760]   last verses of the prophet Isaiah. And the point of this text is simply to illustrate
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:04.320]   how careful one has to be in taking a phrase like "all things" and assuming it includes
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.680]   what it does not include. Here's what it says in verse 22. "As the new heavens and the new
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.880]   earth, as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:26.960]   Lord, so shall your offspring and your name remain," verse 23, "from new moon to new moon
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:36.680]   and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh," there's the phrase, "all flesh shall come to worship
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   before me, declares the Lord." Now, if we stopped right there, after verse 23, we might
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.200]   say, "There it is! That's Colossians 1:20, right? All things are going to be reconciled.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.640]   Everybody's worshiping. All flesh is worshiping." Here's the problem. The next verse goes like
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:02.920]   this, which is verse 24. "And they," that is the all flesh, "they shall go out and look
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:11.840]   on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh." Now,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:28.040]   I think this is clear. And what is clear is that all flesh, like all things in Colossians
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:35.360]   1:20, all flesh in the new creation does not include the flesh of those who have rebelled
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:45.000]   against God. What all flesh means in Isaiah 66, 23 is the totality of humanity in the
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.400]   new heavens and the new earth. There will be nothing and no one there who does not joyfully
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   worship God. Rebels will be outside, away from the glory of the Lord, and that's what
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   I think Colossians 1:20 means as well. That is a worthy stab at a very baffling text.

[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.520]   Wednesday, we return to talk about what happens to the believer shortly after death. Do we
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.720]   go to see Jesus immediately or does that happen only after the bodily resurrection? It's another
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.120]   perceptive question from a listener. And I'll ask Pastor John on Wednesday. I'm Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.680]   We'll see you then.
