[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.200]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.480]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.160]   and this week I went way down the rabbit hole
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.320]   on cell phone plans.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.360]   I probably spent dozens of hours doing research
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.960]   to try to pull together all the information I could,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.880]   primarily so that we could pick the best plan for ourselves
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.840]   and really feel confident in that decision
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.720]   and save as much money as possible.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.360]   So I'm gonna share all the research I went into,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.960]   all the tips, all the tricks,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.760]   all the way to get your price down,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.320]   your features up and get the best deal possible.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.000]   So let's just jump right into it right after this.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.440]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.480]   when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.600]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.020]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.480]   but one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.800]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.480]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.880]   from Anyday, I'm a total convert
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.120]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.920]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.280]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.960]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.320]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.080]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.360]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.200]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.920]   And if you need a recipe suggestion
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.680]   to kick off your Anyday adventure,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.480]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.360]   It is so good.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.840]   And if you haven't checked out
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.720]   you have to check it out.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.600]   All right, I have so much to cover here.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.260]   First off, big shout out to Francis
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.120]   who kicked this whole thing off sending a question in saying
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   would love an episode or a section in a Q&A about cellphones.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.000]   Cellphone plans are so confusing.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.560]   Companies are not comparable.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.760]   Feel like each one says they have the best service.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.600]   Nothing's apples to apples and you just feel lost.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.200]   And then how do you think about insurance and family plans,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.060]   adding lines, and the deals you get
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.900]   for upgrading to a new phone?
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.740]   It's crazy.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.600]   So thank you.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200]   That sent me down this rabbit hole
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320]   which is gonna end up saving me a lot of money.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.920]   So I really appreciate that message.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.400]   It's so confusing and things are changing so much
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.280]   that I actually had to rerecord this entire episode
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   because the first time I recorded it,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.960]   the iPhone 15 had not come out
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.340]   and then plans had changed and now plans have changed again.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.360]   So I can't promise how long all of this information
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.440]   will be relevant.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.000]   But while I will go into the specific dollar amounts,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.440]   I think it's really important to think about the tiers,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.600]   the categories, the quality of the carriers,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.840]   and the features more than the exact dollars
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.680]   because as much as when I record this right now,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.080]   there might be some carriers that are a few dollars more
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.640]   that could change the next week.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.840]   So I'm gonna try to put things in groups
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.520]   and not focus as much on the exact dollars,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.780]   though I will share them so you have some context.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.400]   It reminds me a lot of an article we wrote at Wealthfront
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.360]   when I was there about rate chasing
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.260]   and how as much as you might want
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.240]   the best possible rate on cash,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   the amount of time you spend moving your cash
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.800]   between banks chasing the best rate
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.520]   and not earning interest on those days in transit
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.000]   mean that you're actually probably better off
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.220]   just picking someone that's consistently
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.640]   paying a good interest rate and staying there
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.720]   instead of always moving around and rate chasing.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   So I think the same thing's true here with cell phone plans.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.020]   Find a solid carrier that has good deals,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.300]   that has good pricing, and don't focus too much
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.680]   on whether one's a dollar or more or less here or there.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.720]   So some background on my journey here.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.240]   I had been on Verizon for 10 years,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.080]   primarily because when Amy and I met in college,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.720]   we started dating and her family lived
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240]   in the mountains of Colorado,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.940]   and they didn't have great service if you weren't on Verizon
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000]   and so I just wanted service reliably
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   when we were traveling around Colorado,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.720]   driving at her family's house, et cetera.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.500]   So that was something that was really important
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.600]   and we've just stuck there ever since.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   You know, I'm really glad I did this episode
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   because I think I always knew
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.000]   that we were probably paying a bit much
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.960]   and I'll get to some of the savings you get
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.560]   from cell phone purchasing,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.320]   which actually makes me feel a little better.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.160]   But at the end of the day, Verizon was so expensive
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.120]   that even while I was doing this episode the first time,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.480]   we immediately tried to switch our au pair off of Verizon
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.200]   because she didn't have a device that was getting paid off
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.360]   just to stop some of the financial bleeding
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.800]   that came from that relationship.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   And so we opened her up a line on Mint Mobile
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.760]   a few months back.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.000]   She's had a great experience.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.520]   She actually said the data has been faster
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.420]   and more reliable than it was on Verizon.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.760]   Cut the cost in half.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.200]   She's happy, I'm happy.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.680]   We actually reached out to Mint Mobile
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.840]   and tried to partner with them
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540]   and they became a sponsor of the show.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.280]   So you've probably heard me talk about Mint Mobile already.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.120]   This episode though, just to be clear,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   is not sponsored by Mint.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.760]   It is not something that they've told me to do.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.160]   I'm doing this all on my own.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.720]   It's all my own research.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.520]   They're not getting any special treatment in these reviews,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.260]   but if you do wanna check them out,
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.720]   obviously I'd appreciate it if you do it through our link,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   We are customers of Mint Mobile
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.600]   and we are fans of the product.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.920]   And then finally, we actually did switch off Verizon
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.040]   for all of our lines.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.820]   We were waiting for the final payment on our iPhone 13
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.360]   so that we could get all that money back.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.800]   And I'm gonna save where we went for the end of this
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.000]   as I go through everything.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.720]   So first off, what went into this?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.800]   Way too much research than was probably necessary
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.480]   for the amount I personally saved.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.200]   But I will say I love going down these rabbit holes.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   I did it for insurance.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.520]   I did it for vacation homes
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   and then spent dozens of hours on it.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.240]   I put together a spreadsheet with 50 plus cell phone plans.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.740]   I've been to almost every cell phone carrier website,
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.180]   read countless articles.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.200]   I spent over an hour on the phone
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.400]   with a guy named Stetson who runs a website
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   called bestphoneplans.net
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.160]   and has an amazing YouTube channel.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   He is a wealth of information.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.680]   I'll put a link to both his site
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   and his channel in the show notes.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.280]   Definitely a fantastic resource,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.320]   especially to go compare plans
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.800]   and dig into some of the features.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.080]   And then I built my own table.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.820]   That spreadsheet had 48 plans,
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.040]   had 27 different columns of features
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.640]   and requirements and pricing.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.780]   Started out with 13 carriers.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.680]   I'm sure someone listening is gonna point out
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.400]   that I missed a few carriers
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.920]   or there's a carrier there on that I didn't include.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.400]   There were just only so many things
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.960]   that I could get to fill this out.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.600]   But after I pulled out a few,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.240]   Consumer, Cellular, Ting, Xfinity,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.120]   which just from a pricing standpoint,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.920]   weren't competitive compared to the rest.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then if you factor in,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.520]   is Boost Mobile and Boost Infinite
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.040]   the same company, is it two?
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.320]   I think I know the answer,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.960]   but it leaves eight carriers.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.400]   And that's Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.720]   the ones everyone knows about.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   And then Google Fi, US Mobile,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.640]   Boost Mobile, Boost Infinite, Visible, Mint Mobile,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.660]   and a new carrier called Mobile X.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.500]   I think that's eight.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.400]   Before we jump into any of what I learned,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.760]   I just wanna make sure I clarify a distinction here
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.320]   because there's kind of two classes of carriers in the US.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.760]   And that's because there's what's called an MVNO,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.280]   a Mobile Virtual Network Operator.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.560]   And so when you look at the carriers in the US,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.080]   it's really AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.480]   that own the towers.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.120]   I don't actually know how their arrangements work,
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.240]   but they run the towers, they run the service.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.720]   And then all the other carriers I mentioned previously
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.280]   are all built on and partnered with
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.960]   one of those three main carriers.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.940]   And so, yes, you might have Mint Mobile,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.240]   but you're actually being powered by T-Mobile.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.600]   And so there's some real nuance into how this exactly works.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.680]   And I'm actually gonna go into it
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.200]   'cause I kinda nerded out about it
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.720]   and it was super interesting.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.760]   But I just wanna be clear that in the broadest sense,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   with a couple exceptions,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.240]   a lot of these MVNOs are kind of second-class citizens
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.160]   to the main carrier, T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.960]   In some cases, that's not always the case,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.780]   and I'll cover that.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.960]   But the biggest difference,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   and the reason they're able to charge so much less,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.080]   is that they don't have the infrastructure of stores.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   They often have a lot more limited support.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.320]   They don't have a lot of the marquee features,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.120]   cell phone discount subsidies,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.920]   international roaming, a lot of that stuff.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.440]   So in many of the cases,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.300]   you're not getting the full comprehensive product,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.280]   business plans, all that kind of stuff,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.260]   but you are getting a much better deal.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.100]   I'm gonna go through it,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.200]   but it's really, really incredible
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.920]   how much money you could be saving
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.360]   with a lot of these carriers
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.920]   that I wasn't completely aware of beforehand,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.320]   and I'm kinda disappointed in myself
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.360]   that I didn't know earlier.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.840]   One of the things I learned in understanding
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.920]   how these MVNOs work is this thing called
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.040]   quality of service class identifiers.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.200]   And I'm gonna get a little nerdy,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.800]   but I think it's really interesting,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.280]   and kind of explains why you might not have data
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.280]   sometimes when you see that you have service,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.100]   and a lot more.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.960]   So what happens is each carrier
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.240]   has one of these different
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.560]   quality of service class identifiers, or QCIs.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.600]   They're numbered, usually, from one to nine,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.360]   and they're used for different things,
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.440]   and they are how the towers,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.120]   and how the system prioritizes
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.560]   what happens on the network.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.080]   So for example, QCI one through five
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   are not really data related.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.200]   They are, but they're not the data you get
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.720]   when you browse the web on your phone.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.260]   And so the number one priority,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.340]   the thing that all carriers prioritize
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.800]   over everything else, is conversational voice.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.680]   So if you've ever noticed that it's strange
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.880]   that maybe you have no data, nothing's working,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.100]   maybe you're at a crowded event,
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.360]   maybe you're in the middle of a city,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.460]   but you can make a phone call and it works just fine,
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.040]   that's because the carriers are prioritizing
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.600]   that above everything else.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.240]   So when they look at where the bandwidth goes,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.380]   they give an extremely higher priority
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.580]   to conversational voice,
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.540]   and that does include, depending on the carrier,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.500]   in the stack rank, but certainly over data on everything,
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.720]   voice over LTE, voice over IP,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.280]   different voice protocols that aren't necessarily
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.620]   the original carrier talk,
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.380]   but if you've ever enabled voice over LTE on your phone,
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.700]   that also gets that priority.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.220]   Then the next step, QCI two, is conversational video.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.660]   So if you're making a FaceTime call,
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.580]   you're doing a Google Meet, you're doing a Zoom meeting,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.980]   that actually takes a tremendous amount of priority
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.620]   over most other things.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.860]   After that is a category I don't totally understand,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.300]   and I did a lot of Googling, and there's two things in it.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.580]   One is called V2X, which makes sense,
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.160]   it's your vehicle communication,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.060]   if your car is communicating with the internet,
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.500]   and the other is real-time gaming,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.980]   and I'm not quite sure, other than for latency reasons,
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.500]   why real-time gaming needs such a priority.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.740]   I assume that it's not like
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.540]   the heavy graphics-intensive stuff,
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.480]   but it seems strange that that would be such a high priority.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.580]   The next category is usually for non-conversational video,
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.180]   or buffered streaming, thinking Netflix, YouTube,
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.020]   that kind of stuff.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.660]   After that's a category called IMS signaling.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.700]   Depending on the carrier,
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.940]   sometimes these next three switch around,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.660]   maybe IMS signaling is above buffered video or something,
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.020]   but best I can understand,
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.420]   that's kind of pairing up the phone with the network,
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.460]   and usually also things like iMessage,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.760]   or multimedia messages, or WhatsApps,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.600]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.140]   All of those things take priority
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.140]   over all other kinds of data on all carriers.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.960]   And then within the rest of the carriers,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.100]   and I could get as nerdy as tell you all of them, right?
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.220]   So in AT&T, there's four categories after that,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.500]   six, seven, eight, nine.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.700]   And I'll just run through them,
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.020]   'cause I just think it's fascinating.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.180]   So in AT&T, QCI6, highest priority.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.700]   And when I say priority, I mean,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.420]   if the network is congested,
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.580]   if there are too many devices, what gets through?
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.420]   QCI6 is for their FirstNet network,
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.800]   which is for first responders.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.820]   So first responders are getting all the data
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.780]   before anyone else.
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.940]   And then there's one tier of business plan in there,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.380]   their business elite plan that seems to go up in QCI6.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.340]   After that, QCI7 is all their business plans
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.020]   and their ultimate plans, the really premium plans.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.780]   And then QCI8 is for their consumer plans.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.300]   I think it's the unlimited extra.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.340]   And then QCI9 is for their starter plans,
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.180]   their prepaid plans, and all their MVNOs.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.420]   And I think it also includes
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.260]   all of their tethering, tablets, and everything.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.340]   So a lot of stuff on QCI9.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.020]   Some of the other carriers are a little different.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.100]   On T-Mobile, they put everything T-Mobile on QCI6.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.700]   So all their prepaid, postpaid,
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.380]   everything is on QCI6 and Google Fi.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.980]   So something interesting about Google Fi
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.900]   is most of the time, the MVNOs are a lower tier of priority,
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.300]   except Google has some special deal with T-Mobile.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.340]   So they're up at the top.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.780]   After QCI6, QCI7 is all their essential plans,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.100]   the basic starter plans, and all the MVNOs.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.740]   QCI8 is hotspot.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.380]   So actually all your tethering data,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.120]   both for T-Mobile and Verizon,
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.060]   is gonna be super low priority.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.620]   So if tethering's not working,
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.140]   that doesn't mean that you couldn't
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.020]   maybe do something on your phone, stream a video,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.980]   make a FaceTime call, which I think was something
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.620]   I never really understood until now.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.460]   And then last, with T-Mobile, the bottom line, QCI9,
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.100]   is just reserved for if you have a plan
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.860]   that only includes 50 gigs or something of premium data
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.180]   and you go over it, you're bumped everything after that
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.820]   all the way down to QCI9.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.960]   And then last on Verizon, kind of same thing,
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.300]   except their categories are bunched into three,
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.660]   just QCI7, 8, 9.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.340]   And then QCI7 is for first responders, enterprise.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.440]   That's their priority thing.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.660]   I think they call it frontline.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.180]   And then QCI8 is huge.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.140]   It's all their standard plans
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.400]   and some of the premium MVNO plans.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.000]   And then QCI9 is high use, prepaid MVNO.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.700]   People are over their standard data
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.680]   and QCI8 get bumped to QCI9.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.780]   And then some of their starter and welcome plans.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.060]   I know that's a lot, and it's probably not that relevant
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.920]   to a lot of people, but I thought it was really interesting
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.960]   to understand how this is actually working
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.840]   in the background.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.500]   So they're prioritizing everything
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   according to these things.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   One thing that's interesting,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.340]   as I go through all these plans,
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.100]   is thinking about this concept of premium data,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.540]   prioritization, capping, throttling,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.580]   what does all that really mean?
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.240]   So there's two things I realized.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.300]   A lot of the times you get this premium data
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.580]   and then after you use the premium data,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.380]   you get dropped to a lower QCI
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.660]   or in some carriers you get throttled.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.500]   So it might be 50 gigs of data
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.860]   and then after 50 gigs, it's a lot slower
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.080]   or it's just deprioritized.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.920]   And I think it's important
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.740]   because if you're not in a crowded area,
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.680]   doesn't really matter.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.460]   And when I talked to Stetson, he pointed out,
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.740]   if you're not at a game, a music festival,
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.180]   you know, very dense place,
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.780]   prioritization might never matter.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.260]   But if it's capped and you're throttled after that,
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.420]   well, that definitely matters
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.140]   'cause your speeds are gonna be slower.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.820]   The 50 gigs of fast data that you might get on a plan,
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.300]   if it's not throttled after 50 gigs,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.980]   really kicks in and matters
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.720]   if you are spending a lot of time in crowded places.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.860]   I'm not, so I don't really care about prioritization,
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.540]   but at the end of the day, it is nice to have it.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.100]   So back from the nerdiness
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.540]   of quality of service class identifiers,
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.780]   one other thing that's happened
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.580]   in the last five or six years
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.620]   is that phones are all adding support for eSIMs.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.260]   So if you haven't used this before
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.220]   and you're used to the fact
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.960]   that you have a little SIM card you put in your phone
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.060]   and that stores your number
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.300]   and your connection with your carrier,
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.220]   now you can do all of that electronically
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.060]   and you can have more than one on a phone
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.460]   as long as that phone's unlocked.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.220]   And so I actually transferred my Verizon SIM
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.180]   to an eSIM a few years back
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.140]   and that freed up my SIM card slot
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.420]   so that if I were overseas,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.300]   it would be really easy to buy a SIM card
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.180]   and be able to plug that SIM card in
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.180]   and use that internationally for a much lower cost.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.140]   And now, in fact, there are a lot of marketplaces online.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.540]   I've used one called AirALO,
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.860]   and then there's another one, getnomad.app,
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.780]   but there are really easy places to go buy eSIMs
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.220]   for different countries and regions
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.680]   and get data much, much cheaper
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.660]   than you would normally get from your carrier.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.180]   And so assuming your phone's unlocked,
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.320]   that's a really great option.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.060]   But even if you're just looking at domestic carriers,
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.180]   if you wanted to switch to a new carrier,
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.420]   even try one of them out,
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.660]   you could do that without ever having to go in the store,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.800]   without having to wait for something to be mailed to you,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   especially with some of these prepaid carriers,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.100]   you could sign up, get an eSIM,
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.180]   activate it on your phone with a QR code
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.980]   and be ready to go in a couple minutes.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.000]   So really cool and allows you to do a lot more
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.940]   from your own home or wherever you are.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.060]   Ever since reading "Die With Zero,"
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.700]   we've been focused on maximizing our net fulfillment in life
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.580]   instead of our net worth.
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.660]   So the goal is to make the most out of every day.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.820]   And one of the ways we do that in our house
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.580]   is to not start with mediocre coffee.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.900]   You deserve to start your day
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.180]   with the best coffee you can make at home from Trade Coffee,
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.380]   who we're so excited to be partnering with for this episode.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.740]   Trade Coffee is a subscription coffee service
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.580]   that makes it so simple to discover new coffees
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.460]   and make your best cup of coffee at home every day.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.520]   We've been using Trade for over a year
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.860]   and absolutely love it
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.260]   because they partner with the nation's top rated

[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.080]   Whether you already know what you like
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.020]   or are new to specialty coffee and need some help,
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.820]   Trade makes it easy and convenient to discover new coffees.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.220]   So upgrade your morning routine with better coffee.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.460]   Right now, Trade is offering our listeners
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.100]   a free bag of coffee with any subscription
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.340]   at allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.520]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.140]   for a free bag of coffee with any subscription purchase.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.840]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.580]   Did you know that some common symptoms
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.940]   of electrolyte deficiency include headaches,
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.580]   muscle cramps, fatigue, and sleeplessness?
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.500]   I feel like I'm late to the electrolyte game,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.980]   but after getting pretty dehydrated earlier this year
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.060]   and discovering Element, I am fully on board.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.300]   Element is an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.100]   and has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.220]   That means lots of salt with no sugar,
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.140]   and I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.300]   Honestly, I can't believe I never realized
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.580]   how important it can be to replenish electrolytes,
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.420]   whether that's after having a few cocktails,
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.300]   working out, not feeling well,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.700]   or just to keep up with an active lifestyle.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.620]   And when it comes to how you get those electrolytes,
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.380]   Element was an easy choice for me
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.340]   because there's no sugar, no coloring,
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.260]   no artificial ingredients or fillers,
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.980]   and on top of that, it tastes so good.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.340]   My personal favorite is the Lemon Habanero,
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.420]   and Amy's is Watermelon.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.340]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.020]   to exercise enthusiasts to everyday parents
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.020]   and even podcast hosts like me.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.660]   And if you're not sure if it's for you,
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.420]   don't worry because Element offers no questions asked refunds
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.500]   so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.140]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.440]   with any purchase.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.180]   That's eight single-serving packets
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.140]   free with any Element order.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.560]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.940]   or share Element with a salty friend.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.660]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/element, that's L-M-N-T.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.660]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.660]   You must go to allthehacks.com/element, that's L-M-N-T.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.100]   Let's just talk high level what this looks like.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.180]   So top three carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.980]   I went and read a lot about how to even think about them
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.140]   because at the end of the day,
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.460]   there's two ways to pick here.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.460]   One is picking which network you're on,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.460]   and then the other is maybe which plan or price.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.420]   And so one of those things might be more important
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.260]   to you or not.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.780]   It looks like these days coverage is pretty similar.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.740]   So Verizon was winning best coverage.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.180]   AT&T just took that over, at least according to Wirecutter.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.100]   T-Mobile has the fastest data.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.940]   AT&T supposedly has the worst 5G network,
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.340]   but I think they're all pretty comparable.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.660]   Stetson shared a site called coveragemap.com
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.140]   where people have crowdsourced coverage all over the country
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.100]   so you can get a sense of how coverage is
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.300]   in different places for different carriers.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.740]   But at the end of the day, I would say
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.140]   the best carrier for you is gonna be whatever works
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.300]   where you go most often.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.540]   When we switched, I didn't really think about
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.860]   anything other than who works in our neighborhood.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.180]   And then I assume there will be spots for any carrier
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.700]   that don't work other places.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.860]   We didn't prioritize which carrier was the network
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.020]   when we were making a decision.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.420]   But if you live in a rural area
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.960]   or a place where there's no service in your neighborhood,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.340]   you might definitely care a lot.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.740]   And in a little bit, I'll talk about
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.100]   how some of the carriers have trials.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.500]   Before you consider switching,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.540]   you can actually try them out.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.380]   So we'll get to that.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.820]   So how did I break all this down?
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.940]   I'm gonna pull this spreadsheet up as I talk through it.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.180]   And I broke things down into a few tiers.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.620]   So the first tier is the basic tier,
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.020]   which is $5 to $10 on average.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.100]   These are very low priced lines
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.180]   that you're probably not gonna use for anything,
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.480]   heavy data, heavy calling, but good for emergencies,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.420]   backup lines, kids' lines, maybe parents,
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.340]   that kind of thing.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.700]   The next tier was not unlimited, but more data.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.100]   So think five to 15 or 20 gigs.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.980]   These plans were typically $18 to $25 a month.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.100]   And honestly, if you're not a heavy data user,
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.020]   probably just fine.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.600]   After that, next tier was unlimited,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.540]   which kind of ranges in dollars from $25 to $70,
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.300]   but I would say solid, solid options
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.460]   in the $25 to $35 range.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.180]   Anything in that $35 to $70
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.800]   is probably not worth considering.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.840]   And this is an area where I actually fortunately
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.660]   was able to narrow the list down a little
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.980]   by talking to all the Hacks members
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.980]   and getting their feedback
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.540]   'cause they've used a lot of these carriers.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.380]   The short version is people had great things to say
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.700]   about Visible, Mint, US Mobile, T-Mobile,
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.540]   and less than great things to say about Verizon and AT&T.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.140]   And then there were two tiers past that.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.740]   Unlimited plans that also had native international roaming,
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.280]   meaning the plan you were on could roam
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.300]   anywhere in the world.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.540]   And then unlimited plans
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.540]   with free native international roaming.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.060]   So the former being Verizon plan
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.420]   can go anywhere in the world,
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.640]   but you have to pay $10 a day for a travel pass.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.140]   And the latter plan being
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.180]   don't have to pay for international travel.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.640]   There are a handful of plans
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.660]   on almost all the major carriers
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.140]   that will let you roam internationally for free.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.520]   Okay, so that's a bit of the overview of them.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.360]   Let's run through them.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.900]   So let's do the first tier, which was the basic plans.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   Within this, there are really only two carriers
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.220]   that stood out, US Mobile and MobileX.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.260]   And if you haven't heard of MobileX, I hadn't either.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.440]   They're a new carrier.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.800]   They're doing a lot of interesting stuff
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.340]   when it comes to letting you build exactly the plan you want.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.480]   They are built on top of Verizon's network.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.640]   But for me, I felt like the pricing
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.280]   was not substantially cheaper relative to some carriers
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.020]   that I've just had more experience
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.260]   or have heard others have more experience with.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.260]   So right now, unless you're one of those people
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.420]   that really wants to go be an early adopter,
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.380]   or by all means, go to their website, check them out.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.620]   But if you're in the basic camp,
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.580]   I think US Mobile takes the lead here.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.020]   And to be clear, this is a camp of
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.260]   I don't need a lot of data, phone calls, or anything.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.960]   There's three plans that range from five to $10.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.020]   Their light plan for $5 gives you 500 minutes
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.700]   and 500 texts and 500 megs of data.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.300]   It's not a lot, but taxes included, five bucks a month.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.040]   Great option for a backup plan.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.700]   Maybe it's a plan for emergencies.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.880]   Maybe it's a plan for kids
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.680]   that don't need to use the phone much.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.640]   The next plan is their kosher plan,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.000]   which includes unlimited talk and text, but no data at all.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.880]   And then they have a shareable two gig plan,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.200]   which is two gigs shared with however many lines
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.320]   you have on it that started at $10 a month.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.160]   That's another option.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.280]   So all those plans, I think this camp
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.360]   is probably not one we need to spend much time on
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.760]   other than few use cases that I've heard people bring up
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.060]   are using a basic line like this
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.860]   for all your two-factor authentication
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.620]   so that your primary line isn't the one doing that.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.900]   So you don't have to risk
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.420]   that there's anything going on there.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.180]   In fact, I heard a really cool tip that someone gave me
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.700]   of not just setting up a line on US Mobile for this,
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.820]   but then actually disabling that line
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.860]   so that even if someone got ahold of your phone
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.740]   and wanted to check your two-factor authentication,
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.780]   they wouldn't even know that the messages
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.820]   were coming through because the cellular line's off.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.440]   And then if you need to get one of those codes,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.560]   you can turn it on, get the code, turn it off again.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.840]   And just to be clear, I'm a huge advocate
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.200]   of using app-based two-factor authentication
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.800]   over text messaging, removes any risk of a lot of issues.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.680]   So I will just set that aside and say,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.780]   obviously I would prefer that,
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.960]   but there are still some financial institutions
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.720]   and sites that don't support that.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.920]   And so when you need text message, two-factor auth,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.840]   if you wanna get a separate line for it on a separate number,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.660]   I think the US Mobile plans are probably the best option
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.280]   because they're five to 10 bucks, taxes included,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.300]   and probably cover enough texts
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.460]   that you can take care of this easily.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.220]   In this next tier of plans,
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.460]   I'm looking at things that have some data,
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.400]   but not unlimited.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.000]   And just as an anecdote, we all love unlimited.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.140]   We all wanna make sure we never run out of data,
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.340]   but I looked over three or four months of data
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.520]   from our family.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.020]   We have a family plan and only my sister's au pair
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.180]   ever went over 10 gigs of data in a month.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.220]   And some months she hit 32 gigs,
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.340]   so make sure you can prepare for what you need.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.020]   But if you go into your current carrier
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.920]   and look back over the last year
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.620]   at how much data you were using each month
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.960]   and you're never going over,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.660]   and keep in mind, if you haven't traveled,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.640]   but you have travel coming, that might change.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.520]   But this band of plans is something worth looking into
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   because if you don't need unlimited data
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.160]   and you're not gonna use it, why pay for it?
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.240]   And so within this bucket, Mint Mobile, Boost Mobile X,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.840]   US Mobile kind of all had options.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.700]   And I guess Google Fi also had an option
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.020]   where you could have a plan and you pay by the gigabyte,
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.000]   but it actually was never the best deal
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.960]   compared to all these plans.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.640]   So I'm gonna leave that Google Fi flexible plan off.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.740]   I'll probably also leave the Mobile X plan off,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.120]   the basic unlimited five,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.880]   because I just think it's a little early.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.480]   And then that leaves Mint, US and Boost.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.920]   And here's the thing about Boost.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.900]   I am sure someone will message me to tell me
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.000]   they're very happy, but Boost Mobile
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.920]   was one of the most confusing carriers
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.400]   for me to actually understand what was included.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.760]   So I put some emphasis and value for me personally,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.440]   when I'm on a website of a cell phone company
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.960]   of whether I can understand how the plan works,
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.240]   what's included, what's not.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.880]   And there were plans that I just still to this day
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.560]   have questions about on Boost.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.240]   And then Boost, I guess, got spun out of the T-Mobile
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.280]   Sprint merger and moved over to be owned by Dish.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.160]   And then instead of launching a new version of Boost,
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.600]   they launched a separate one called Boost Infinite.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.800]   And I think Boost Infinite is the post-paid one,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.440]   meaning you're paying at the end of the month
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.520]   and they're doing a credit check
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.680]   versus the prepaid one, which is Boost Mobile.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.480]   But honestly, Boost was never such a better deal
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.920]   that to me, it made sense to ever consider a carrier
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.000]   that was that confusing.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.900]   In some cases, it was the same price,
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.040]   but it was never cheaper.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.800]   And so for me, I ruled that out.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.880]   So if you're someone who doesn't need unlimited data,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.400]   but wants something in the five to 15 gig data range,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.840]   I think the two plans out there
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.580]   were Mint Mobile and US Mobile.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.360]   And they both came in about the exact same price
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.840]   at about $18 a month.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.720]   A few subtle differences between them,
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.280]   'cause they are very, very similar.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.080]   Mint Mobile's built on top of T-Mobile,
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.680]   US Mobile's built on top of Verizon or T-Mobile.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   You actually get to pick which SIM card you want
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.920]   in the signup process and you can change,
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.140]   but I think you even have to port your number
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.840]   over to the Verizon SIM card,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.280]   which is a little bit of a process.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.840]   But those two plans, $18 a month,
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.240]   about the same price as you scale with more lines.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.760]   A few of the subtle differences between Mint and US Mobile.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.380]   And I speak from experience with Mint
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.920]   because we've had a really great experience
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.220]   and others I know have had a good experience with US Mobile.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.840]   One of the nice things about our Mint Mobile plan,
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.760]   and maybe this is unique to our use case,
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.080]   but because we have an au pair joining us for a year,
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.240]   we can just buy a SIM card for a year.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.420]   We don't have to worry about paying again and again.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.680]   We can prepay the entire year all upfront, plans done.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.920]   I think for a five gig plan, the price is probably under $200.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   Even for their unlimited everything plan,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.160]   it's under $400 for the whole year.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.480]   And for anyone who just wants to prepay for something
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.000]   and eliminate their monthly bills,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.280]   you could do that with Mint Mobile.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.440]   You could prepay the whole thing.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.880]   In fact, to get their best deal without a family plan,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.560]   you do need to prepay for the year.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.800]   Fortunately, it's so inexpensive
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.920]   that it actually doesn't feel as burdensome to prepay.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.000]   I think about what it would cost
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.760]   to prepay our Verizon plan for the year,
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.000]   and it'd be thousands of dollars.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.740]   Though, it's kind of refreshing to imagine
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.560]   you could prepay your phone plan for the year
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.760]   for a few hundred dollars.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.020]   Other subtle differences, referral programs.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.160]   If you're someone that likes to refer other people,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.980]   Mint Mobile, for every referral you get
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.740]   to the unlimited plan, you get $90 of credit,
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.960]   which means you could pay for your entire phone plan
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   for the year with two to four referrals,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.120]   depending on what plan you're on.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.720]   US Mobile has a referral plan also,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.340]   but it's only $25 a line.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.880]   But if you do call internationally,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.680]   US Mobile includes free calling internationally
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.920]   on most of their plans.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.600]   So double check which plan you're looking at,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   but I think on this plan, it does include that.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.640]   Also, one thing that I think is worth mentioning
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.520]   is that if you look at Mint Mobile,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.340]   you'll see that they have unlimited plans for $15 a month.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.280]   And that's because when you buy the first three months
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.320]   of your unlimited plan, it's only $15.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.200]   So instead of talking about it as $15 in perpetuity,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.520]   I've amortized that price over the course of the year.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.240]   So it effectively covers all of your taxes
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   and fees for the year.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.620]   Yes, the plan is $30 plus taxes and fees,
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.560]   but because you get it for $15 a month for three months,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.300]   you end up saving $45, which I actually think more
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.160]   than covers the taxes and fees for the year
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.400]   and brings the plan closer to about $29.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.040]   But I just wanna clarify that for anyone
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.960]   who's comparing the pricing I'm talking about
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.780]   to the website.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.680]   And then last, none of the plans in this bucket
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.880]   include any international coverage,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.360]   except the Mint Mobile plan does allow you
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.560]   to roam internationally.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.280]   I will say that for most countries,
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.800]   it's cost prohibitive to do it,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.360]   but you can at least do it.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.480]   And so the one area where it seemed to make sense
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.440]   is if you're in Mexico, you can make phone calls
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.160]   for 6 cents a minute, which is actually not that high.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.880]   So you could just add on $5 of international coverage
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.120]   and that would cover your ability
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   to make 6 cent a minute calls.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.000]   Data's much more expensive, I'd probably skip on that.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.340]   But at least you have the option
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.560]   to make a phone call in Mexico,
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.400]   whereas on a lot of these other plans in this bucket,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.240]   you wouldn't.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.520]   So U.S. Mobile or Mint Mobile are the two standouts
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.280]   in that bucket of, I don't need unlimited data,
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   five gigs is enough.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.120]   There's a couple of plans that are in the 15 to 20 gig range,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.580]   but honestly, they're all in the 23, $25 range
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.960]   when you factor in taxes,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.800]   such that I think you're better just going up
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.200]   to the unlimited plans that start at $25.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.700]   And taxes is actually an important thing to mention here.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.400]   Some of these carriers, U.S. Mobile, Visible, and T-Mobile,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.080]   a lot of their plans include taxes in the prices they show,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.000]   and almost every other carrier doesn't.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.760]   So to try to keep things fair,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.300]   I went and tacked on $3.20 of taxes and fees per line
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.840]   for all these plans, which I think is a reasonable amount,
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.700]   but I think our fees were a little higher on Verizon,
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.500]   but they were a little lower on Mint Mobile.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.960]   So there's not a perfect number,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.560]   but I'm trying to give you ideas of prices
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.960]   that are fully included of fees.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.940]   So when I mentioned earlier,
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.760]   U.S. Mobile and Mint Mobile were great five
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.280]   and six gig plans, U.S. Mobile was 18 fees included,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.540]   Mint Mobile was 15 plus the $3 I added.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.040]   So they came out about the same price.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.520]   Okay, I think the next two tiers of plans
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.980]   are where we all wanna spend our time.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.520]   So let's talk about this, unlimited data.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.560]   I'll give some caveats
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.740]   'cause unlimited doesn't always mean unlimited.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.400]   And by the way, one of the features that's included
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.720]   on almost all of these plans is Wi-Fi calling.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.860]   So yes, you might be overseas and not have roaming,
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.000]   but if you're on Wi-Fi,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.920]   you can still make phone calls through your Wi-Fi.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.720]   Though one really important thing to keep in mind,
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.640]   I learned this lesson the hard way on Verizon,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.760]   is that if you're on the Wi-Fi and you're on Wi-Fi calling
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.720]   and you call the country you're in,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.280]   even if you're in the middle of a roaming session
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.520]   that includes free calling within the country,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.680]   that doesn't include free calling from Wi-Fi calling.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.320]   So if you were like we were in London,
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.800]   trying to make a local call within the UK,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.320]   make sure your Wi-Fi is off if you are on a carrier
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   where you're supposed to be getting free calling.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.920]   If you're on a carrier like U.S. Mobile
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.560]   and you have free calling internationally,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.340]   you actually definitely want Wi-Fi calling on for sure.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.120]   Okay, so let's talk about this unlimited bucket.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.700]   These are unlimited plans
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.360]   that do not have any coverage overseas
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.040]   with a few small exceptions.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.920]   So let's run through them.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.280]   And in general, the bulk of the ones that I'd say
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.760]   are worth considering are in the 25 to $30 range.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.940]   So the ones that really stand out to me here
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.400]   are Visible, U.S. Mobile and Mint Mobile.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.640]   Visible didn't have a cheaper plan,
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.360]   which is why I haven't talked about them before.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.120]   They are owned by Verizon.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.240]   I should have mentioned U.S. Mobile
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.160]   is an independent company.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.720]   Mint Mobile is in the middle of being acquired,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.520]   hasn't closed yet by T-Mobile.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.180]   You might've seen their ads.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.240]   Ryan Reynolds is one of their biggest shareholders,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.680]   so you've probably seen him talk about it.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.800]   And so within this plan for 25 to $30,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.480]   you can get unlimited data.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.000]   Now, what does unlimited mean?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.200]   It really means that you're gonna get unlimited data
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.440]   up until a cap at which you will either be throttled
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.920]   or deprioritized.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.980]   So deprioritized doesn't mean
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.080]   you're getting slow data necessarily.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.940]   It just means that if congested,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.680]   you are not going to get data as fast as others around you.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.220]   The cap for all of these plans
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.720]   is anywhere from 30 to 40 gigabytes
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.640]   in that 25 to $30 range.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.440]   One other consideration is how much data you get
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.600]   for hotspot.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.640]   So if you want to use your phone to tether,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.480]   how does that work?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.360]   On the Visible plan,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.720]   you actually get unlimited tethering,
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.160]   but it's capped at five megabits per second,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.960]   which for me seems way too much of a cap.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.600]   If you're trying to jump on your computer
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.560]   and sync something before you get on a plane,
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.520]   it's just too slow.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.740]   So if hotspot tethering is important to you,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.660]   the Visible plans cap out at five megabits per second.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.520]   But if you don't care about tethering
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.140]   or you don't need it to be too fast
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.720]   and you do want to be piggybacking on the Verizon network,
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.120]   I think Visible is interesting.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.000]   It's actually one of the only truly unlimited plans.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.400]   Yes, the data might get deprioritized,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.800]   but there's no throttling.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.720]   On the US Mobile and the Mint Mobile plans,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.280]   you get 30 and 40 gigabytes respectively.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.540]   But after those caps,
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.760]   you get throttled down to one or less megabytes per second.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.040]   So if you care about hotspot, Visible's out.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.680]   If you don't, Visible, US Mobile, and Mint
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.320]   are really great options here, all in the $25 to $30 range.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.000]   The subtle differences are
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.440]   you get a little bit more premium data
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.600]   on the Mint Mobile plan.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.160]   You get a little bit more tethering on the Mint Mobile plan.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.000]   And then obviously all the other considerations
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.720]   I said earlier about referral programs,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.700]   prepaying, and all that.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.020]   You could look at Boost Mobile and MobileX again
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.720]   in this bucket, but it's all for the same price.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.640]   I personally didn't think they were a good fit.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.120]   Funny enough, Boost Mobile does include Mexico roaming,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.120]   but they cap that roaming best I could tell
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.640]   at two or three G speeds,
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.560]   which is just not really worth using to me.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.600]   So I believe you could use it for SMS and calls in Mexico.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.720]   So if that's really important, maybe the Boost Mobile plan.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   But like I said earlier,
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.360]   carriers where I can't understand exactly how it's working
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.480]   aren't a great fit for me.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.620]   And at the high end of this,
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.460]   you've got T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T,
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.720]   their starter welcome essentials plans.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.360]   And they're all in the $60 to $70 range
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.000]   for really the same thing.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.120]   It's a plan without all the premium features
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   with some cap on data, some cap on hotspot,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.180]   some no hotspot.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.240]   The Verizon welcome plan is $68,
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.500]   includes no hotspot coverage at all,
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.760]   includes no international coverage at all,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.680]   and costs more than twice
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.240]   all those plans I mentioned earlier are.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.760]   So for me, it's absolute no-brainer.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.480]   If you want a plan that has unlimited data
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.020]   and you don't need any features or roaming or anything,
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.560]   there's no real reason that Verizon or T-Mobile
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.960]   or AT&T would fit the bill.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.200]   There's a time in every business
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.980]   when that problem you've been ignoring needs to be handled.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.160]   If you're getting frustrated
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.360]   with how you're selling online or in person,
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.740]   I can't recommend Shopify highly enough,
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.560]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.560]   for this episode.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.760]   Shopify is the commerce platform
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.560]   revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.520]   Whether you're a garage entrepreneur or IPO ready,
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.280]   Shopify is the only tool you need to start, run,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.360]   and grow your business without the struggle.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.200]   And believe me,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.760]   after starting and running three businesses in my career,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.800]   I faced so many struggles from hiring to fundraising
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.000]   to launching a product,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.380]   and I always came out the other side better,
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.720]   but I put so much value on any service
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.500]   that helps avoid that struggle.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.400]   For example, if you're selling online,
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.480]   Shopify makes it easy for you to show up
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.280]   exactly the way you want to.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.860]   You can customize your online store to your style
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.880]   with gorgeous flexible templates and powerful tools.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.340]   And if you have a way with products but not words,
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.740]   you can use Shopify's new AI-enabled tools
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.640]   powered by Shopify magic

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.560]   and email subject lines
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.320]   that will help you save time and sell more.

[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.120]   I wanna share some feedback from a listener named Mike
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.300]   who emailed me about our sponsor today, AG1.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.380]   He said he's been taking AG1 every day
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.540]   for the past two years,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.720]   and he's seen great results in his blood work
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.980]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.620]   And when he showed it to his doctors,
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.020]   they were impressed at the actual ingredients.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.380]   So Mike, thank you for sharing your experience.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.260]   I too am a big fan of AG1,
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.700]   and it's been in my routine for almost two years as well
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.380]   because just one daily serving
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.260]   gives me the comprehensive foundational nutrition I need
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.180]   and supports energy, focus, strength, and clarity
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.060]   with 75 high-quality vitamins, probiotics,
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.940]   and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.460]   So it can completely replace
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.980]   your multivitamin, probiotics, and more.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.140]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.220]   add a few ice cubes
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.260]   because I think it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.260]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.540]   and energized for the day,
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.980]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.100]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.200]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.860]   with less than one gram of sugar
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.620]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.220]   So if you're looking for a simpler,
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.940]   effective investment in your health,
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.460]   try AG1 and get five free AG1 travel packs
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.700]   and a free one-year supply of vitamin D
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.320]   with your first purchase.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.780]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.

[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.060]   Check it out.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.540]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.040]   and supporting the show.

[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.340]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.900]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.040]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.140]   So before I go forward,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   I wanna talk a little bit about international roaming
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.700]   'cause that's the next line is
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.740]   where I think you get a big feature unlock there.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.580]   I think unimportant part of that is considering the value
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.920]   of being able to get data internationally
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.680]   versus to be able to have your phone work
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.900]   without any changes.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.700]   So for all these plans, if your phone's unlocked,
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.620]   you can get an eSIM.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.260]   So when you're traveling internationally,
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:51.380]   you can just add an eSIM for as low as sometimes $10 a week
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.780]   and get unlimited data.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.500]   So if you're gonna travel once a year
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.620]   and you don't mind that your phone number's not gonna ring
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.720]   because you're actually gonna turn your cell phone line off
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.880]   and just activate a data-only SIM on another carrier,
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.960]   then you could save a lot of money
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.260]   and then get on one of these $25 to $30 a month
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.600]   unlimited plans, rely on eSIMs
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.940]   when traveling internationally.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.300]   You could even turn on your Wi-Fi
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.340]   and do Wi-Fi calling to use your number.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.100]   And honestly, I think it might be the best option
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.540]   if you're willing to pay a little bit more
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.940]   just to not have to deal with that.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.260]   There are some really great options
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.740]   that are still way more affordable
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.340]   than we were once paying on Verizon.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.540]   But I just wanna flag that it's a lot easier now
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.260]   with all these marketplaces for eSIMs
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.740]   than it was in years past.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.260]   And then one more thing I forgot to mention
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.660]   about a lot of the carriers, especially the MVNOs,
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.980]   is that there are features
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.780]   that you might come to expect a carrier to have
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.740]   if you're on Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T,
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.460]   that you might find out don't work on some of the MVNOs.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.620]   For example, I was talking to someone with US Mobile
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.940]   and I don't believe they support call forwarding.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.420]   Now, if you've never used call forwarding
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.740]   to automatically forward your calls, it doesn't matter.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.220]   But if that's a feature you use a lot,
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.140]   you might wanna look into whether that's supported.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.220]   If you have an Apple Watch
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.060]   and you wanna use it with cellular data,
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.980]   I believe the only one of these MVNOs
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.540]   that bubbled to the top of my list was Visible.
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.540]   So that's something you might need to look into
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.460]   if that's important.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.660]   And then one other thing is around auto pay.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.900]   So this is not usually a requirement
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.140]   for a lot of the MVNOs, but it is for the major carriers.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.620]   Nowadays with T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T,
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.980]   if you want their best rate,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.380]   you have to set up auto pay
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.980]   and you have to pay with a bank account
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.020]   or with a debit card.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.420]   For T-Mobile, they'll add $5 a month
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.820]   if you pay with a credit card.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.340]   And for AT&T and Verizon,
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.420]   they're gonna charge an extra $10 a month
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.540]   if you pay on a credit card.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.780]   So I'll come back to why that matters at the end
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.940]   when we talk about cell phone insurance and coverage,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.300]   but just something to keep in mind
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.400]   that if you're thinking, "Ooh, I wanna earn some points,"
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.460]   all the major carriers are gonna be more expensive
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.340]   and I don't think it's gonna pay off
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.140]   unless you're factoring in cell phone coverage,
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:41.960]   which I'll get to.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.820]   So let's talk about these major plans
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.100]   that have all the bells and whistles,
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.020]   all the features, a lot more premium data and everything.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.060]   This first tier,
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.920]   I'm actually not a fan of anything in this first tier,
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   to be honest.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.840]   This is the T-Mobile Magenta Go 5G,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.380]   the AT&T Extra, the Verizon Plus.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.980]   They're not the number one plan.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.180]   They're the lower premium plan.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.500]   And the reason I'm not a fan of them
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.260]   is because I don't think they have enough bells and whistles
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.940]   to make it worth it over an MVNO.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.660]   And you can get better plans on some of these carriers
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.540]   for cheaper in the top tier.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.260]   So there's not a case I could make
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.700]   for a single one of these plans.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.020]   And that's the T-Mobile Magenta Go 5G, AT&T Premium,
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.700]   AT&T Extra, Verizon Plus, AT&T Starter.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.820]   So I'm actually just gonna skip over them and point out why,
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.340]   but there are two things worth calling out.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.980]   One, AT&T has three plans.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.600]   They have Starter, Extra, and Premium.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.780]   And the Starter, I don't think makes any sense
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.260]   because it's almost $70
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.300]   and it doesn't seem to include much more
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.140]   than the $25 plans you can get on a lot of other carriers.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.020]   So skip.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.020]   And then on T-Mobile, for just $10 more a month,
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.380]   you get AT&T Premium.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.420]   But AT&T Premium is eligible for a $10 a month discount
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.940]   if you have an employer that has a partnership with AT&T
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.820]   or you have AARP, which anyone can sign up for.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.860]   Yes, you have to pay for it,
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.380]   but I'm guaranteed $10 a month will make up for it.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.780]   So no one should be on the AT&T Extra plan
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.660]   because it's the same price as the AT&T Premium plan
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.460]   if you have AARP membership,
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.540]   which you should be able to get very inexpensively.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.660]   Also, you probably haven't heard me talk much
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.200]   about family plans yet.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.080]   And the reason for that is that most of the MV&O plans,
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.120]   which are really all the plans we've been talking about,
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.360]   don't really offer a bulk rate for more lines.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.640]   The exception being U.S. Mobile does offer a discount
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.800]   when you go to three lines or more.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.560]   And Mint Mobile, you don't get a lower rate,
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.320]   but when you're on a family plan with multiple lines,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.560]   you get the annual pricing at quarterly payment intervals.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.160]   So you don't have to prepay the whole year
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.120]   if you don't want to,
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.600]   but you can still get that annual pricing.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.720]   So I'm gonna skip over this tier of can-go international
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.800]   if you pay for it and jump straight
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.640]   into the can-go international and it's included.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.540]   The one caveat to that is that AT&T Premium plan,
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.360]   because if you want to be on AT&T,
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   they do not have a plan, at least as a time of recording,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.040]   that includes international travel to the world.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.840]   They do let you travel to Latin America and Canada,
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.880]   which I think all in means
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.840]   you can go to about 20 countries free,
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.800]   but that is much smaller of a number than the other plans,
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.080]   which are anywhere from 102 to 200 plus countries.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.360]   Now, that AT&T plan will let you go to those countries
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.400]   for $10 a day,
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.360]   but I just want to caveat that even though it is priced
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.240]   with that discount $80 a month, which is a lot,
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.080]   you don't get that international travel.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.260]   So huge knock.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.440]   There aren't a lot of other bonuses and perks that you get.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.880]   So not actually a fan of the AT&T plan at all.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.220]   Within the international is included,
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.480]   there are T-Mobiles, Magenta Max, Go 5G Plus,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.300]   and this new plan they launched called Go 5G Next,
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.800]   which is really designed for people
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.680]   who want to trade in their phone every 12 months,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.560]   but still get subsidized discounts.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.160]   So if that's you, take a look at it.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.780]   Otherwise, I think it's too expensive.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.760]   That includes Verizon's Ultimate plan,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.960]   Google Fi's Plus plan, and US Mobile's Premium plan.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.000]   So I know that's a lot of stuff.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.640]   So let me talk a little bit about takeaways here.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.920]   From a pricing standpoint,
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.120]   the Verizon Ultimate plan never makes sense.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.680]   At $93 a month, going down to as little as $55 a month
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.320]   on a family plan with five lines,
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.700]   it's just significantly more expensive than every other line.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.120]   It does include 10 gigs of high-speed data
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.000]   when you're traveling,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.720]   but it doesn't include a lot of other perks.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.780]   In fact, I used to be on this Verizon plan,
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.120]   which I believe was their middle-tier plan,
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.500]   and one of the perks it included
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.360]   was you got one free day of international roaming,
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.600]   but you could bank those days up to 12 total
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.960]   and then use them all at once.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.280]   And if you didn't want that,
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.360]   you could be on another one that included Disney Plus,
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.520]   but the Ultimate plan,
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.480]   everything except international roaming,
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   I think is a la carte.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.760]   So if you want Disney Plus, if you want Walmart Plus,
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.520]   you pay all these different packages
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.080]   that you can add on for $10 a month.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.160]   So at the minimum with tax,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.920]   $93 a month for one line is just a lot.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.220]   And I should mention, like I said,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.440]   these are all one line prices.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.360]   So 55 is as low as you'd pay.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.800]   So I think that's off the table.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.220]   So if Verizon's out,
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.200]   let's go to the other end of the spectrum and see who's in.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.640]   So you've got Google Fi with their Plus plan,
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.400]   which is really interesting because like I said,
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.040]   they're fully prioritized on the same QCI as T-Mobile.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.800]   The best feature of the Google Fi plan,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.900]   aside from its pricing,
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.940]   is that you get unlimited 5G international data.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.120]   There's no five gigs a month, 10 gigs a month,
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:42:59.960]   it's everything.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.920]   You've got a couple of perks.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.760]   They'll give you one year of YouTube premium,
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.440]   a hundred gigabytes of Google One data storage,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.600]   and it's really reasonable.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.480]   So unlike when I was saying Verizon is 93 a month
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.760]   for one line, AT&T 78,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.400]   with no international roaming other than Latin America,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.720]   Google Fi gives you all that for 68.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.960]   And again, this is me estimating taxes.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.240]   And if you scale that up,
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.080]   it goes from 68 all the way down to $43 a line,
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.540]   which makes it, in my opinion, the most compelling plan
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.680]   if you want true international coverage.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.640]   Now, US Mobile has a premium plan
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.560]   that is also really interesting.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.560]   And just to be clear,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.600]   if you choose it on the GSM T-Mobile network,
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.760]   it will work internationally.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.680]   If you do not,
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.160]   then I don't think it's a compelling option in this bucket,
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.560]   but that plan includes a hundred gigs of fast data
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.040]   and will let you roam to 102 countries for free
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.320]   at 10 gigabytes a month.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.160]   So that's awesome.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.560]   I'll get to the list of countries.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.460]   It is missing a few,
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.680]   and depending on what kind of travel you're doing,
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.380]   it might not be the best fit
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.800]   because it's not all the countries,
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.260]   but it is pretty compelling.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.660]   That's at $50 a month.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.240]   The price per line does go down from 50 to 45 to 40
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.900]   as you scale up the numbers of lines,
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.020]   but where I think the US Mobile premium plan is exciting
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.720]   is in that one to two line range.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.840]   So I was talking about Google Fi,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.880]   saying that's my favorite,
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.440]   and I haven't mentioned T-Mobile yet.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.280]   And here's why.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.560]   Google Fi, I think, is a really great option.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   It's built on T-Mobile, same priority,
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   and you're getting it for anywhere from $43 to $68 a month,
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.060]   depending on how many lines you have.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.400]   T-Mobile, on the other hand,
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.220]   is somewhere between $44 to $85 a month.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.360]   In fact, the Go 5G Plus plan is $90 a month,
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.620]   which makes it not too far off from Verizon,
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.760]   except there is one incredible deal
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.080]   that I don't hear spoken about often,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.080]   but I have found in all of my research
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.400]   and taken advantage of,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.880]   and that is T-Mobile's insider pricing.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.920]   Best I understand this,
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.720]   the reps that work at T-Mobile stores
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.740]   have the ability to give insider pricing,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.800]   which ends up being 20% off their premium plans for life,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.360]   to customers who move over from other carriers.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.460]   You can get this by finding someone online.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.740]   You can get this by just walking into the T-Mobile store
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.580]   and asking, and usually having luck.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.820]   Or if you're an AllTheHacks member,
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.420]   I'll share the contact information
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.900]   of the people I worked with in the membership portal
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.820]   so that you can get access to that as well.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.940]   I don't wanna overwhelm them,
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.300]   or I would just share it with everyone,
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.820]   but they asked me to keep it limited,
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.660]   so you'll have to go find your own.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.980]   There are some threads on Reddit
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.900]   that I use to find a couple people.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.660]   I'll send you there if you want to.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.540]   Or, obviously, you can go to allthehacks.com/join
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.700]   and join us on the membership.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.240]   So with that discount, if you add that 20%
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.740]   and taxes being included,
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.220]   that brings the price down for T-Mobile's plan
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.740]   to anywhere from $37 to $68 a month,
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.140]   which is actually the same or cheaper than Google Fi,
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.440]   except you get all the extra perks that T-Mobile includes.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.340]   That means you're getting free Netflix,
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.660]   free Apple TV+, a year free of AAA,
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.180]   and free Wi-Fi on American, United, Delta, and Alaska.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.740]   So throwing in all those perks,
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.580]   the only trade-off that you're giving up over Google Fi,
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.700]   of course, is that your international data
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.660]   is capped at five gigs per month at high speed,
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.300]   and then unlimited at like a 3G speed,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.260]   which is usable, but not great.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.620]   And so for me, I thought that was
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.420]   definitely worth the trade-off,
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.540]   and the plain Wi-Fi easily saves $10 every time.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.860]   And if you want the hack here,
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.580]   I believe that T-Mobile Wi-Fi
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.060]   is only supposed to be for mobile devices.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.660]   It is not supposed to be for a computer,
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.140]   but if you switch your computer to browsing
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.660]   in mobile view using the inspector on developer tools,
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.740]   which I will find an article on the internet
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.620]   that shows you how to do it,
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.780]   and you refresh the page on all those websites,
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:32.940]   you will now see the option
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.420]   to activate your T-Mobile account
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.180]   and use that free unlimited data.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.420]   And if you have a family member
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.260]   who's not traveling with you, but on your plan,
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.300]   you could use their number
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.140]   to activate your Wi-Fi on your computer,
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.980]   and your number to activate it on your phone,
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.020]   and get two devices.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.660]   So pretty awesome perk.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.940]   That insider discount not only applies
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.620]   to the consumer lines, but it applies to business lines.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.020]   It stacks on top of the third line free.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.860]   So if you look at the pricing for three lines
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.020]   with that insider discount,
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.180]   you're getting T-Mobile's Go 5G Plus,
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.340]   international data, Netflix, Wi-Fi, Apple TV Plus
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.780]   for $40 a month.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.660]   So 10 to $15 more than the unlimited,
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.620]   no international, no perks plans,
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.340]   which depending on your situation
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.780]   may seem like a great deal
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.540]   or may seem totally unnecessary.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.780]   So spoiler is we switched over to that T-Mobile plan
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.180]   and have had a fantastic experience.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.140]   We were able to do all the swapping remotely.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.620]   We didn't need to go into any stores
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.900]   and everything's been really easy.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.540]   So I guess the takeaway, if I try to summarize all this,
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.900]   because I'm sure some people are completely overwhelmed
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.300]   from everything I threw out at you.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.820]   If I'm going through these tiers,
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.980]   it's at basic, if you want a spare line
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.140]   or someone doesn't need a lot,
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.740]   you can spend five to 10 bucks a month on U.S. Mobile.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.140]   If you don't use that much data
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.740]   and you need a five gig plan,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.380]   I think U.S. Mobile or Mint Mobile are great options.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.940]   We happen to have picked Mint Mobile.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.020]   We're very happy.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.980]   We're not planning on switching off of it.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.980]   They're all in that same ballpark of around $18 a month.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.180]   If you want unlimited data
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.100]   and you don't need any extra features
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.740]   or you're willing to just use an eSIM when you travel,
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.620]   for 25 to 30 bucks a month,
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.740]   I think you can go on U.S. Mobile, Mint Mobile, or Visible.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.300]   Visible is not a great option
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.420]   if you need to tether to your phone ever.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.300]   It is a great option if you want an Apple Watch
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.540]   because it's the only option.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.580]   And then Mint Mobile and U.S. Mobile are also great
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.980]   with Mint Mobile offering a little bit more hotspot
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.140]   and a little bit more fast data coverage.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.860]   And then on the roaming side,
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.140]   if you do want a fully baked premium plan
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.620]   with all the features, all the roaming functionality,
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.300]   if you can go to a T-Mobile store
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.060]   and you can get the insider discount
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.340]   or find someone on Reddit,
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.740]   I think that's the way to go.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.020]   You're gonna get a price as low as $35 a month
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.420]   if you have five lines, which is incredible.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.180]   But if for some reason you can't get that insider discount,
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.940]   your options are Google Fi, which I think is great.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.260]   Or if you're one or two lines,
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.980]   I think U.S. Mobile's premium is another contender,
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.020]   as long as you don't need to go
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.300]   to all those other countries,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.260]   which I'll get to in a second.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.180]   So the one area where I probably
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.540]   didn't give enough coverage to
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.980]   is if you don't care about the international travel,
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.500]   you don't wanna go all around the world,
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.900]   you do want unlimited data,
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.100]   but you do want something that covers Canada and Mexico,
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:00.300]   'cause let's say you go there a bit.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.180]   There are a few options that I think are worth considering.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.980]   However, I'll just flag that they're not
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.300]   that much less expensive than the plans
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.460]   that cover you internationally.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.420]   So for example, if you're one line,
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.940]   that U.S. Mobile premium plan is gonna cover you
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.260]   in 102 countries.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.900]   And yes, you could save money
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.700]   by getting the Visible Plus plan,
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.340]   and it's only $45 a month.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.260]   It includes Mexico and Canada,
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.860]   but for five more dollars,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.420]   you could get a lot more coverage.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.500]   It really depends on what matters to you.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.820]   You can also get, I believe, $10 off
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:29.860]   for your first six months.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.340]   That brings the average cost for the year
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.060]   on that Visible plan down to $40.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.420]   But all the other plans that include Canada and Mexico
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.180]   for one line are at 53, 60.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.380]   So it just doesn't make sense.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.060]   Now, if you jump down to how low could you get a plan
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.740]   that includes Canada and Mexico,
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.220]   if you had five lines,
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.700]   there's at least a couple options worth looking at here.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.820]   The Google Fi Simply plan
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.660]   and the T-Mobile Essentials plan,
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.580]   both include Canada and Mexico.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.900]   At five lines, they're down to 23, $24 a month.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.260]   So those might be good options for you.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.500]   But I will just caveat that at one or two lines,
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.100]   they're about the same price as the premium plans
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.540]   on either U.S. Mobile, Google Fi, T-Mobile
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.740]   with the insider discount.
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.180]   So there are a couple options there,
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.100]   but honestly, they might not make as much sense
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.460]   as one of those premium plans.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.060]   Once you factor in things like limited speed on hotspot.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:15.900]   So like I mentioned,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.500]   I wanna share a little bit about countries
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.820]   because I thought it was really interesting
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.940]   to go through all of the countries
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.660]   that these different plans cover.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.940]   So they all say 200 plus countries.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.060]   It was very difficult to find that list.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.540]   When I tried to sum them all up,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.100]   AT&T came with 223, Verizon and T-Mobile with 211
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.740]   and U.S. Mobile with 105.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.620]   And just one anecdote that was very interesting
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.660]   going through this list was that many of these plans,
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.780]   in fact, I think at least every plan
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.340]   had multiple countries listed twice
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.820]   in some way, shape or form.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.940]   So they would say we include the Northern Mariana Islands
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.340]   and then they would individually list out all three islands
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.500]   or they would include Great Britain, the UK and England.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.820]   One included the British Virgin Islands twice,
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.220]   one included Tanzania and Zanzibar,
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.620]   one included Tahiti and French Polynesia.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.740]   So I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.960]   into the actual count of countries
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.060]   because if one has five more countries,
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.220]   it might just be that they've listed the same country
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.320]   twice, five times.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.940]   But I will flag a few of the notable countries
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.580]   that are missing from some of these plans.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.260]   And I'll start with the U.S. Mobile plan
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.460]   'cause I mentioned that the U.S. Mobile plan
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.380]   only includes about 105 countries.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.100]   So there are definitely a handful of countries missing.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.660]   Many of them might not be countries you go to that often.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.940]   So I'm not gonna read the entire list of 100.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.640]   I am gonna focus on a few of the notable exceptions.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.940]   So a lot of the honeymoon destinations were missing,
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.180]   Fiji, the Maldives, French Polynesia, the Seychelles.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.340]   A couple of countries that I was just surprised,
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:45.460]   Monaco, Morocco, Jordan, Botswana,
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.500]   Bermuda and Belize were all missing.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.900]   So that's just a few.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.740]   Obviously, you need to go look at the list,
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.940]   think about where you're traveling
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.940]   to determine whether 105 countries from U.S. Mobile
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.740]   is enough or 200 plus is better.
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.300]   When it comes to comparing Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile,
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.800]   there were really only a couple things that differed
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.940]   when I looked through the list.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.260]   Only T-Mobile includes coverage in the Maldives,
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.280]   if that matters to you.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.980]   And then T-Mobile is missing Ethiopia,
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.360]   Namibia and Zimbabwe.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.420]   So AT&T and Verizon cover those, but T-Mobile does not.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.240]   Given how infrequently you'll probably go to those countries,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.320]   at least the average person,
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.780]   if you need an eSIM for that one trip in your lifetime,
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:20.880]   I think it's probably okay.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.700]   But in general, I think T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T's
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.400]   kind of 200 plus country list covers just about everything.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.100]   So there are a few other things we didn't mention
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.540]   that I said I would cover at the end,
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.980]   which actually could have a big impact
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.220]   on some of this pricing.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.300]   It's mostly gonna be around the deals and discounts
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.080]   and credits you get when you switch.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.380]   So the one thing I didn't mention,
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.420]   which I think is really necessary,
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.300]   is some of the deals you'll get
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.460]   from many of the large carriers
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.500]   and some of the small carriers for coming over,
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.440]   because when you look at those deals,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.480]   they can really have a big impact.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.580]   So for example, if you look at coming over to T-Mobile,
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.560]   there are deals to pay off your old phone
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.180]   on your previous plan or give you $200 credit
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.460]   that I can't assume will be relevant to everyone,
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.540]   but they were offering a $200 credit
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.640]   to port your line over,
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.300]   which if you spread that out over a few months,
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.860]   could really be a big deal.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.580]   I would be totally remissed if I didn't talk about
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.640]   some of the discounts you get as a veteran,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.040]   a first responder, or being 55 plus.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.300]   When I was looking at T-Mobile,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.540]   all those camps basically got the insider pricing
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.220]   effectively without needing the insider discount.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.580]   So if any of those apply to you
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.300]   or someone on your family plan,
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.020]   I believe you get those perks as well.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.380]   So definitely worth considering those
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.940]   if you also want a discount that's even easier to get
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.300]   than needing to find someone with the insider deal.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.540]   But the big discounts,
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.420]   and especially with the launch of the latest iPhone
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.580]   that I think everyone needs to be considering
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.700]   is what kind of deals do you get for getting a new phone?
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.600]   Because they can really change the dynamics here.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.660]   So there's really a few different options.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:55.140]   Most of the MVNOs don't have the big subsidized pricing
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.420]   on iPhones and contracts and all that stuff,
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.860]   but they do offer deals.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.400]   So for example, if you bring a new iPhone over to Mint Mobile,
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.780]   they'll give you six months free
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.100]   over the course of your first year,
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.540]   which is worth up to $180.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.420]   So you get $180 off an iPhone.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.140]   But another way that you can save a ton of money
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.180]   is around when new phones come out.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:15.040]   And usually this focuses all around new iPhones.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.600]   The MVNO carriers don't usually have deals in this space.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.020]   And frankly, Google Fi, while they do support the iPhone,
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.940]   definitely doesn't have any iPhone deals.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.100]   In fact, is the only premium plan I would put in that bucket.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.460]   And also, by the way, doesn't support an Apple Watch either.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.940]   But Mint and US Mobile do have deals.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:35.460]   US Mobile will give you $200 off spread out over a year
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.140]   if you bring a new iPhone to them.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.380]   And Mint Mobile will give you 50% off
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.980]   their unlimited plan for the year
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.460]   if you buy an iPhone from them,
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.940]   which you can do upfront or finance through them.
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.040]   So those are two options.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:49.060]   But the really big deals are from T-Mobile, AT&T,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.180]   and Verizon, where you're gonna get 800 to $1,000
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.660]   off your new iPhone, usually with a trade-in,
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.980]   over two to three years,
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.980]   which ends up being, minus the value of your trade-in,
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.900]   $22 to $33 a month.
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.100]   Verizon, I believe, has this crazy promotion going on
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.460]   where you can trade in any iPhone, literally any iPhone.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.620]   You know, you can trade in your old 3G iPhone.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.580]   I don't know who's tested it at what tier,
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.500]   but you can get some real value there
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.180]   depending on how much your trade-in is worth.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.380]   So keep in mind, if your iPhone's only a year old
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.820]   and you could sell it for $600
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.140]   and they're gonna give you $800,
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.420]   well, it's not that different from a $200 plan.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.700]   If you can trade in a phone that's worth $100
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.860]   and get $1,000 off an iPhone, then it's really worth $900.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.940]   And if you can average that $900 off
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.380]   over two or three years, that's 25 to 30 bucks a month.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.300]   And what's crazy is if you look at the plan we looked at,
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.060]   the T-Mobile plan, at $35 a month for five lines,
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:45.340]   if you can get $800 towards your iPhone
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:49.580]   spread out over two years, that's $33 off a month.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.540]   And I say this because this is the deal we got,
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.140]   which I'm still in shock about.
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.980]   So we opened up a line with T-Mobile.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.780]   We actually did it on a business plan.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.340]   So I can't promise that the deals
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.660]   are exactly the same as a consumer plan,
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.620]   but we got an $800 credit to buy a new iPhone.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.980]   We didn't even have to trade in an iPhone.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.580]   The consumer deal was get a $1,000 credit,
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.420]   but you have to trade in an iPhone,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.260]   but you also got a $200 credit to port in.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.740]   So it was actually pretty similar.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:19.180]   But when we amortize the cost of that $800 over two years,
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:23.860]   it's $33 and our plan is somewhere around $35 a month.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.180]   And so as crazy as this sounds to say out loud,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.660]   if you want a new iPhone and you're willing to pay for it,
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:30.700]   and you're gonna pay for it
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.780]   whether or not you get a new carrier,
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.540]   if you do it through T-Mobile,
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.700]   you can potentially get the net cost of your plan
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.860]   down to under $5 a month for two years.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:41.700]   And that's what we did.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.220]   So yes, we bought new phones.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.060]   You don't have to pay them off over time.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.220]   You can pay them off right away.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.500]   You do have to buy them with a financing plan.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.220]   But as soon as the financing plan set up,
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.060]   you can pay them off.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.180]   I think our phone bill right now
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.100]   looks like it's 35 a line plus 45 for the phone,
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.940]   minus 33 for the credit.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.260]   We ended up getting phones
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.780]   that were more than the $800 credit they would give us.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.140]   Though if we didn't, you know,
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.980]   then we wouldn't have any Delta there.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.980]   But if we just pay the phone off,
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.900]   then our plan will look like 35 a month,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.300]   minus 33 in credit, it'd be $2 a line.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.620]   So obviously those credits
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:13.940]   are not gonna be given to you right away.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.060]   They're gonna be given to you over two
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.540]   or even three years in the case of Verizon,
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.740]   maybe even AT&T.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.660]   So you are going to be locked into those carriers
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.340]   if you want those device credits.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.060]   Obviously you can leave at any time.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.620]   You don't have to pay termination fees like you used to,
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.740]   but those device credits
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.220]   are not gonna continue to come to you.
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.380]   If you don't wanna mess with any of that,
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.300]   you can still do US Mobile, Mint Mobile, Visible,
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.500]   Google Fi, T-Mobile, any of those plans
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.300]   and not buy the devices.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.060]   But I do think that some of the crazy promotions
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.740]   they're offering for iPhones
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.460]   make it such that some of these premium carriers
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.860]   can get discounted to the point
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.100]   that they're actually competitive
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.100]   if you're comfortable kind of being locked in
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.140]   for two or three years to get that credit,
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.460]   which means that it'll hurt your upgrade cycle.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.340]   I guess I'll end on the one plan I didn't mention,
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.460]   which was that Go 5G Next plan,
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.740]   which is that it'll let you enter
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.460]   into another one of these deals with T-Mobile
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.060]   without having to wait two years to get all those credits.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.540]   Haven't looked into the nuance of it
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.900]   because I just didn't think it made sense.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.780]   I usually don't upgrade my phone every cycle.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.660]   It's usually every other cycle, so it doesn't matter.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.060]   So that's what I learned there.
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:15.980]   A few last things.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:19.340]   For free trials, T-Mobile, Google 5, Visible, and Mint
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.700]   all offer various forms of free trials.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.580]   You can activate them with an eSIM.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:25.700]   You don't need to port your numbers over,
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.820]   and you can get some amount of text, data, and voice
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.220]   to use on their network
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:32.900]   without having to transfer your line for free.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.100]   So definitely recommend if you're interested
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.940]   in checking out whether you have good service
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.780]   from those carriers,
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.140]   don't worry about trying to switch everything right away.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.340]   Add them as an eSIM.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.140]   You can turn the data network to be using that eSIM,
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.700]   and you can see how it works before you switch.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.340]   The last thing that I wanna touch on
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.640]   is around cell phone insurance.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.940]   Because of the changes with the autopay,
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.560]   it's made a lot of the benefits
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.340]   of getting free cell phone insurance on your credit card
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.740]   negated by the extra cost you have to pay.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:04.080]   So for example, AppleCare+ is $9.99 a month.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.420]   If you have to pay $10 a month
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:06.900]   to be able to pay with a credit card,
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.260]   it might not actually be worth it
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.820]   over just getting the insurance policy from Apple
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.580]   where it's a lot less hassle
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.940]   and usually a lower deductible to get things fixed.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.500]   But for some of these carriers
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.180]   where you don't need to worry
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.460]   about paying extra for autopay,
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.700]   there are a bunch of great options.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.660]   The FreedomFlex, the Platinum and Business Platinum
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.180]   from Amex, the VentureX from Capital One,
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.580]   and the Inc. Business Preferred
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.100]   all have solid credit card insurance.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.800]   I think the built card as well.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.620]   You're all gonna get about 800 to $1,000 per claim.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.100]   You're gonna get two to three claims per year
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.900]   or per 12 month window.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.300]   And they're probably gonna cover
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:47.020]   somewhere around one to $3,000 in total.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.900]   Usually the more premium cards have more premium coverage
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.780]   with deductibles somewhere between 50 to $100.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.220]   And so the Inc. Business Preferred
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.260]   actually also gives you three points per dollar
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.780]   on cell phone plans, which is cool.
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.900]   So I definitely think that's the better deal
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.180]   if you don't have to pay to put your plan on your card.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.860]   If not, then I think AppleCare+ is a decent option.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.680]   You could do it for 9.99 a month for a new iPhone
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.460]   or 13.50 a month if you include theft and loss coverage,
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.900]   which means if someone steals your phone,
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.660]   you lose your phone, that's great.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.740]   But a really great tip from Nat who wrote in to say,
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.780]   just a reminder to everyone,
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.340]   AppleCare theft and loss coverage will not be honored
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.340]   if you remove your phone from your Apple ID
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.920]   because then it's removed from being linked to you.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.500]   So if someone steals your phone or you lose it,
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.820]   go ahead and mark it lost, lock it down,
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.340]   request a remote wipe,
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.780]   but don't remove it from your Apple ID.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.040]   Otherwise it's unlikely that you will be able to get them
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.300]   to cover your phone.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.380]   So something important there.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.740]   Also Lars wrote in just to say that had a phone broke
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.260]   and he'd been paying his cards on his credit card
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.740]   and was able to get it reimbursed easily.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.560]   I've taken advantage of that three or four times
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.380]   and it totally makes sense in my opinion.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.920]   The cost to get a new iPhone screen with no coverage
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.980]   is over $300, with insurance it's 50 to $100,
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   with AppleCare it's $30.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.820]   The only last thing I'll say,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.660]   we actually, when I said I got a business plan on T-Mobile,
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.540]   they have a business plan that includes AppleCare Plus,
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   ends up being about $39 a line for five lines
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.180]   for all the full features plus AppleCare Plus.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.060]   So if you have a business that could be an option,
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.780]   if not, just do the math about whether it makes sense
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.700]   to pay a fee to put it on your credit card
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.620]   or to get coverage somewhere else,
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.980]   or to self-insure and just roll the dice.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.820]   If you've never really broken an iPhone screen
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.540]   and you use a really heavy case, maybe it doesn't matter.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.660]   I hope that was helpful.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.820]   If you have any questions or feedback,
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:49.500]   please send an email to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.180]   For the last two years, I've tried my best
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.420]   to respond to all of them.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.060]   I will do my best to try to respond when I can,
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.060]   but I wanna set an expectation going forward
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.740]   that I won't be able to reply to every single email.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.340]   I do have a separate inbox for member emails.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.060]   So if you are a member of All The Hacks,
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.540]   please keep those emails coming.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.980]   I will make sure to respond.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.500]   If you're not and wanna join,
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.620]   you can go to allthehacks.com/join,
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.020]   but I will still continue to take the questions
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.580]   from listeners and bring them up in mailbag episodes.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.740]   So even if I can't get you a quick reply
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.700]   and you're not a member,
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.660]   I will consider the questions that make sense
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.660]   to be content for future shows.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.740]   So keep an ear out and listen for those.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.380]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.860]   I really hope people listening
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.500]   save a ton of money on cell phones.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.860]   I would love it if you end up saving a lot
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.140]   to let me know how much.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.700]   I'm gonna do a quick share in a future episode
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.820]   of how many people we've helped get off
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.340]   really, really expensive, big wireless plans.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.340]   If one of the plans from Mint Mobile makes sense,
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.860]   just like it did for us and for our au pair,
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.060]   I'd really appreciate it if you use the link
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.380]   at allthehacks.com/mintmobile
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.140]   to help thank them and support them
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.580]   as a partner of the show.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.940]   We've had a great experience with them
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.460]   and we've really enjoyed working with them
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.340]   and we'll continue to have their coverage
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.860]   probably for a long, long time.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.660]   That's it, I will see you next week.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.040]   (birds chirping)
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:19.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
