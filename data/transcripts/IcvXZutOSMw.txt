[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.160]   - Today we have a mature question for married couples.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.120]   It's an answer to a question we most recently got
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.280]   from an anonymous woman,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.880]   but one I've seen pop up in the inbox over the years.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.280]   And I know it's not an isolated question, here it is.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.600]   Hello and thank you, Pastor John,
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.360]   for answering biblical questions
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.240]   and for being one of the few willing to address
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.340]   so many awkward intimacy questions
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.640]   on the podcast over the years.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.480]   Well, that's very true.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.920]   Nothing is too awkward on the APJ podcast.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680]   We've proven that definitively over the years.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.560]   Back to the email.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.280]   It's also a Bible question,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.600]   and I doubt I'm the only woman who wants to know this
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.040]   and who is too uncomfortable to ask her pastors.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.120]   Here it is.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.680]   In Leviticus 18, verses one to 30,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.640]   and Leviticus 20, verses 10 to 21,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.560]   we find lists of sexual sins.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.300]   It appears that these sins were forbidden universally,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.020]   not just for Jews of the Old Testament era,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.980]   because Leviticus 18, 24,
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620]   and chapter 20, verses 22 to 23,
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.620]   mention that the non-Jewish nations
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.460]   would be cast out of their land
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.580]   for committing these sins too.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.780]   Most of the sins on this list
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780]   are discussed again in the New Testament,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.500]   so I understand that they remain sins today,
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.400]   things like adultery, incest, and homosexuality.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.380]   However, there's one Old Testament sexual sin
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.100]   mentioned three times in Leviticus,
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.140]   in Leviticus 15, 24, 18, 19, and 20, 18.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.540]   But it is never mentioned anywhere in the New Testament,
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.740]   and nobody seems to address it anywhere.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.900]   It's about sexual relations with a spouse
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.020]   during the woman's menstruation.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020]   My question is this,
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.020]   within a marriage, is this still a sin today?
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.860]   (laughs)
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.300]   - Well, if nobody addresses it, here we go.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.340]   (laughs)
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.340]   I think the New Testament has something very practical,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.700]   precious, profound to say about this issue,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.980]   and that's why I'm willing to venture a few thoughts.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.500]   Of course, this is part of a huge issue,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500]   namely, are Christians who are justified
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.540]   by faith in Christ the Messiah,
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.960]   and are participants in the new covenant
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.900]   that has made the old covenant old and gone,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.900]   are we obliged to keep the Old Testament law?
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.400]   That's the bigger question
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.820]   that's behind this very specific one.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.940]   So let me say a word about that first.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.460]   The New Testament teaches in Hebrews 8,
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.400]   2 Corinthians 3, Romans 7, and elsewhere,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.580]   that the Mosaic law,
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.060]   from which these commands in Leviticus are coming,
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420]   the old covenant has been supplanted
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.580]   for believers in Christ with a new covenant
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.580]   secured by the blood of Messiah Jesus.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.780]   In a profound sense then,
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.060]   Christians are set free from the Mosaic law.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.020]   Paul put it like this in Romans 7, 4, and 6,
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.500]   "My brothers, you have died to the law
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.720]   through the body of Christ.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.140]   Now we are released from the law,
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.300]   having died to that which held us captive,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.460]   so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.940]   and not the old way of the written code."
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.300]   Now, that does not mean
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.620]   that the commandments of the Old Testament
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.420]   have no place in the Christian life.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.640]   We have to take into account, from this same author, Paul,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.500]   passages like 1 Corinthians 7, 19.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.560]   He says, "Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   counts for anything but keeping the commandments of God."
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.580]   Well, that's puzzling,
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.820]   because circumcision was a commandment of God.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.580]   And he says, "You don't have to worry about that one,
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.500]   but keep the commandments."
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.860]   So he's clearly making some kind of distinction
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.460]   between some kind of commandments
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.940]   that we're supposed to be concerned with
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.640]   and others that are not to be followed.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.400]   So what is the basis for making that distinction?
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.120]   How are we supposed to understand that
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.640]   when our lives are on a new footing?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.760]   Law-keeping is not the basis of our right-standing with God.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.840]   So does the New Testament give us some help
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.980]   in how to use the Old Testament commandments,
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.600]   even if they don't have the same role in our lives
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.080]   that they did for Israel?
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.180]   Yes, it does.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.960]   Number one, I'm just gonna give a few examples.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.320]   This is a huge topic,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.200]   and whole books have been written about it,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.120]   and here I am dealing with it in 10 minutes.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.320]   Number one, for example, it says that if you love God
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.440]   and love your neighbor, you have fulfilled the law.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.520]   All the law and the commandments, Jesus said,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.720]   hang on these two commandments.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.280]   Second, another example is the relationship
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.440]   between the gospel and the way of life
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.480]   that accords with the doctrine
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.080]   that follows from the gospel.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   I'm thinking 1 Timothy 1, 8, where it says,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   "We know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully."
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.980]   Well, the gospel has the death of Christ as its center,
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.260]   and so all the Old Testament commandments
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.460]   about the sacrifices and the priestly ministrations
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.200]   are fulfilled in Christ, our priest, our sacrifice,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.940]   so those laws are not required
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.600]   because the gospel has replaced that entire system
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.060]   as the way our sins are forgiven,
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.260]   and we have this priestly connection
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.780]   with God through Jesus Christ.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.300]   One more help from the New Testament,
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.200]   the third illustration, and there are more.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   Laws are to be appropriated which were rooted in nature
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.940]   as God created it.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.680]   For example, Paul argues in Romans 1
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.220]   that homosexuality is not just wrong
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.620]   because it's forbidden in Leviticus,
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.620]   it's wrong because that prohibition is rooted in nature,
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.300]   abiding nature that doesn't change as God created it.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.260]   Now, there are other criteria
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.940]   for how to properly use the Mosaic law,
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.960]   but these three point the way.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.060]   Does it express the command
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.460]   that we're trying to decide whether to obey?
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.500]   Does it express the love of God and the love of man?
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.700]   Does it accord with the gospel of Christ?
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.300]   Is it rooted in nature?
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.580]   Those would be three criteria.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.460]   Now, in view of all of that,
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.740]   I would say that the prohibition
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.020]   of sexual relations during menstruation
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.900]   in Leviticus 18, 19, 20, 18,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   Ezekiel 18, 6, Ezekiel 22, 10,
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.900]   are not demanded of us as Christians.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.060]   I think that's the implication of Romans 7, 4, and 6
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.940]   that I quoted a minute ago.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.260]   So the question becomes,
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.260]   okay, if we don't have an absolute prohibition,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.120]   what should guide us in this matter?
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.300]   And I'll suggest two considerations
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.060]   for a husband and a wife to think and pray about.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   One is the roots of the prohibition in the Old Testament,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.420]   and the other is the path of love
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.560]   between a husband and wife.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.340]   Now, think with me about the roots
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.020]   of this Old Testament prohibition
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.740]   of sex during menstruation.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.820]   Here's two verses.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.700]   Here's Leviticus 18, 19.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.780]   You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.100]   while she is in her menstrual uncleanness.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.260]   Mark the word uncleanness.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260]   Second text, Leviticus 20, 18.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.180]   If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.580]   and uncovers her nakedness,
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.100]   he has made naked her fountain,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.100]   and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.480]   Now, two issues, it seems, then,
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.320]   lie behind the prohibition.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.800]   One, uncleanness, and two,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.460]   the exposure of the fountain of blood,
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.800]   whatever that means.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.320]   Now, the term uncleanness, very importantly,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.680]   does not refer to sinful impurity
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.360]   because, we know this because,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   no sacrifice was required in Leviticus because of this,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.560]   but only washing with water.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.880]   In other words, there's no sin involved
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.040]   in her menstrual flow.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.360]   That's not what the uncleanness refers to.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.520]   It's not sexual or sinful impurity.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.840]   The issue was ritual purity
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.820]   rooted in real cleanliness.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.640]   Before the more modern ways
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.880]   of dealing with the menstrual flow,
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   countless of generations of menstrual bleeding
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.160]   was a perennial problem for women,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.720]   indeed for men, of cleanliness.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.080]   Menstrual rags were metaphorical in the Bible
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.720]   for filthiness.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   This was the word used in Isaiah 64, six.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.160]   All our righteousness have become
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.840]   like filthy menstrual rags.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   It was a tremendous burden for women to have to deal with,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.100]   and very likely, the issue of sexual relations
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   was simply considered extremely unsanitary
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.680]   and made the whole challenge of a woman's cleanliness
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.760]   even more difficult
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.080]   if there was sexual intercourse involved.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.320]   So that's my reckoning with that first word, unclean,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   and the roots.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.100]   It's the roots of the simple burden
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.560]   of how do we maintain appropriate cleanliness
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.080]   in the community.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.560]   Now, here's the second one.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.600]   Uncovering her fountain.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.240]   This is something different than the problem of cleanliness.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.440]   This is probably a reference
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   to something sacred and profound.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   The woman's monthly cycle is a constant testimony
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.520]   of a woman's glory of bearing and nurturing life
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.360]   in her womb.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.520]   She has that potential.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   It shows up and manifests itself every month.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.280]   Every month, she is reminded
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.760]   that she has the incredible potential.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.720]   The welcome of life is signified every month
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.020]   by the building up of blood,
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.560]   and life is in the blood, Leviticus 17, 11.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.600]   Life is in the blood.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   It is a life-giving spring or fountain.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.800]   And during the menstrual flow of blood,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   there is the reminder that a life did not happen this month,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.120]   though it might have.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.760]   That's how much potential resides in that fountain.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.860]   And my guess is that this entire process
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.380]   with all of its profound potential
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.560]   as the fountain of life was simply
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.780]   not to be casually observed.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.900]   It was not to be intruded upon.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.760]   It was to be concealed.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.600]   It was an indictment when Leviticus 20, 18 says,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.160]   "He has made naked her fountain."
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.200]   This is not a matter of cleanliness.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.040]   This is a matter of sacrilege in the Old Testament.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   A fountain in its sacred flow is to be protected.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.420]   That's my effort to understand those two roots
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.220]   in the Old Testament of why it was forbidden.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.180]   And I can imagine a Christian married couple today
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.020]   thinking this through along both of those lines
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:59.020]   and choosing freely as Christians to refrain briefly
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.040]   because the Bible says husbands and wives
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.800]   shouldn't abstain from sexual relations for long,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.660]   but briefly abstain from sexual relations
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.200]   not because they have to, but because they choose to
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.120]   for reasons that they themselves agree on.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.040]   But since I don't think that the prohibition of sex
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.520]   during menstruation is an absolute requirement,
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.200]   how shall a couple settle the issue
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.760]   when one of them feels one way
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.320]   and the other feels the other way?
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.720]   And I use the word feels rather than theologically thinks
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.780]   because that, my guess, is really the issue.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.360]   It's not doctrine here, it's desire, right?
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.340]   That's what's driving the issue here.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.340]   Desire either for sex or desire not to have sex.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.980]   Two desires that are competing.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.480]   This is where the principle of love that I mentioned
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.600]   a moment ago is going to work its miracle.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.200]   Here's the guideline from 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.920]   The wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.400]   but the husband does.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.520]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.860]   over his own body, but the wife does,
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.760]   which means that he has authority to have sexual intercourse
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.360]   with his wife during menstruation,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.300]   and she has authority not to have sexual intercourse
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.780]   with her husband during menstruation,
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.240]   which means this issue's not gonna be resolved by authority.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.360]   It's a draw.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.580]   It's going to be resolved by love,
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.940]   and love will discern the deep things
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.900]   of the heart and the body.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.420]   And if she finds sexual relations
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.060]   during menstruation offensive, or he does,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.060]   his inclination will be to exercise self-control
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.080]   and love for her, sacrificially, like Christ,
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.220]   for her sake and really thus for his.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.220]   And if she finds his desire for her to be very strong,
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.900]   she may give him that gift,
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.660]   or she may surprise him with some other pleasure.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:18.660]   But I would say, especially to husbands, as the leader,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   you should take the lead in exercising self-control,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.020]   which is a fruit of the Spirit, and so bless her
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.140]   and win her affections, which I don't doubt
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.340]   will pay dividends in the rest of the month.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.180]   - Awkward but helpful.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.020]   And man, can you imagine being a priest in the Old Testament,
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.060]   an expert in all body fluids?
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.900]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.860]   - Well, let's keep it awkward.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.700]   Send us your awkward Bible questions.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.240]   Email us, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.

[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.000]   We've addressed several intimacy questions now,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.160]   and you can find those all in the podcast archive online

[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.320]   We break for the weekend.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.800]   On Monday, we will look at the place of holiness
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   in the Christian life.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   If we are fully justified in Christ,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.260]   why is personal holiness that big of a deal anyways?
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.480]   Well, it is a big deal,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.540]   and Pastor John will be back with us to explain on Monday.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.320]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   Thanks for listening.

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.480]   (upbeat music)
