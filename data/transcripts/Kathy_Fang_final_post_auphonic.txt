[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.720]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast and in this special episode
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.340]   I have with me chef and entrepreneur Kathy Fang from Fang Restaurant.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.340]   Welcome to the show.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.340]   Hi.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.340]   Thank you for having me.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.520]   It's a big honor to be here.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.040]   No, it's been great.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.560]   I really enjoyed watching you.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560]   Was it on the Food Network?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.040]   Was it Chef Dynasty during COVID, was it during quarantine or we're getting out of COVID?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   And it was just awesome to see you, you know, be the woman boss and run the restaurant and
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.520]   interact with your dad who is so sweet.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.320]   So thanks so much for coming on the show.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   Yeah, the show Chef Dynasty, how's the Fang, actually aired last year, time flies, last
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.720]   year, January time frame, and it was very beneficial for us because it came out right
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.160]   after COVID and people were just starting to eat at restaurants again.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.440]   Initially, people were doing takeout.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.320]   And so it was just a really great way to get started, get back into it again with the show
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   coming out.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   No, that was great.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   It was so entertaining.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.960]   Are you guys going to do another season or season one?
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   That's it?
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   No, there's nothing in the works yet.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.700]   The concept itself, I don't know if you're like a big Food Network fan or watch a lot
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700]   of their shows.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.400]   This is the very first time they've ever done this type of format.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.000]   They call it docu-series, occupational series type of thing.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.880]   They always do food competitions, bake shows, stand and stirs, which is teach people how
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.000]   to cook, but they've never done this sort of reality base where you're following someone's
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.920]   life and what restaurant life is like.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.480]   And on top of that, they've never done something where it was an all Asian cast about a Chinese
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   restaurant.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.440]   So there was a lot of new things within this show that we kind of had to try to figure
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   out.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.520]   For now, it's only one.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.240]   We don't know if there'll be more seasons or whatnot, but for now, it takes a lot of
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.400]   work just to put that show together, to be quite honest.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.800]   Yeah, that whole process is almost two years.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   Two years?
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   Wow.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   In the making.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.120]   We also can't share if anything were to happen.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   Ah, okay.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.600]   So one episode, was it 30 minutes for one episode or is it 60 minutes?
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's actually a 50 minute show.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.360]   So how many hours of filming to produce 50 minutes?
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.840]   So it was six episodes, 50 minutes each.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.000]   That was one full season.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.880]   It took, I would say back to back, it was six weeks full, five to six days a week, sometimes
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.760]   10 hours, 11 hours a day of following us around.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.040]   And then on top of that, they have to do backup scenes and things that they feel like they
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.180]   weren't able to cover the last time they were there.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.680]   And so in the aggregate of putting just six episodes together, 50 minutes each, I would
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.160]   say there's probably 12 to 14 weeks of shooting.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   Wow.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   10 hours a day.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.600]   It's a lot of shooting just to go into putting together six episodes.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   Right.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   It's crazy.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.040]   And I'm sure some viewers or listeners will be wondering, is there compensation to be
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.320]   on that show or is the compensation the exposure and the marketing of the restaurant?
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.880]   There is compensation, but it's nothing that's going to help make you get rich or anything
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   like that.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   And that's the general trend anyhow.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   When you look at any of the reality show folks, like they don't make their money necessarily
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.240]   from the show until they hit it really big.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.480]   Then they can get paid millions per episode and their time.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.720]   But in the beginning, you really get paid like peanuts, but it's the exposure, right?
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's not comparable to what we would make at the restaurant, but being able to do something
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.960]   like that is a big deal.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.720]   And there's a little backstory to this.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.640]   When I opened Fang Restaurant, that was over 15 years ago, it was not very common to see
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.840]   a ton of female Asians on a food show.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:29.320]   And I had this dream of wanting to be essentially like the female version of Martin Yang or
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.120]   the female version or Asian version of Giada De Laurentiis.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.760]   I wanted to have a cooking show, teach people how to cook.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.200]   And a lot of the customers would come into our restaurant and talk to me.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.360]   And I'm a pretty social type of restaurateur and chef.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.520]   A lot of chefs always hide back in the kitchen and I'm very interactive.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.800]   I come out, I talk to people, I don't really wear the chef's jacket that much.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.200]   And so people are saying, "Hey, have you ever thought about being on TV?"
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.520]   And that's kind of what sparked the idea of wanting to be on the food show.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   But I had a lot of pushback during that timeframe.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.480]   I want to say, I tried to pitch this idea of teaching people easy Asian cooking for
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.640]   over a decade.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.860]   And it was always, "Nobody wants to learn Chinese food.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.240]   It's too difficult.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   It's still considered too exotic.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.200]   People from middle America are going to have trouble replicating these dishes.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   They're not going to know what any of these pantry ingredients are."
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.280]   And then the other thing was that, "Oh, people just love tacos, burgers, and pizza."
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.360]   Chinese food just doesn't have that spark to it yet, believe it or not.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.920]   And I'm like, "That's crazy because Chinese food is one of the most popular cuisines.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.960]   In fact, there's more Asian or Chinese restaurants than there are McDonald's."
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.920]   But none of those stats matter.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   And so after maybe pitching for several years, I decided that's fine, I'll go and do some
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   other stuff.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.080]   So I started competing on Food Network and did some other food shows just to get my face
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.080]   out there.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.640]   I was blogging at the time very consistently.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   I used to have a food blog called MyFangalicious, put over 600 recipes of mine on there.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.800]   I don't have time to do that anymore.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.520]   So I kind of stopped that.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.960]   But just making sure I was always putting my name out there or putting something out
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.240]   there related to Fang and our family and see what happens, right?
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.640]   Throw it out to the universe and see what happens.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.680]   And a lot of different producers had reached out to me, I would say, over eight or nine
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.640]   years ago when I one-chopped, basically.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.200]   After I one-chopped, a lot of people started coming and saying, "Hey, let's try to put
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   a show together."
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.360]   It was never a stand and stir.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.040]   Everyone kind of just was like, "No, no, no, we don't want to do that."
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.200]   But a lot of people thought we could do a reality thing.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.920]   And the ideas were different.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.800]   One of them was following female entrepreneurs who are Asian in San Francisco.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.880]   That didn't work.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.120]   Nobody wanted to do that.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   Too early.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.180]   This is before Crazy Rich Asians.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.880]   And so after multiple pitches, I think I started to kind of just...
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   I don't want to say I gave up on it, but I gave it a rest.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.200]   We stopped pitching.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.240]   I also ended up becoming pregnant and having Ava and just started focusing on taking care
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.040]   of the baby and working.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.740]   I started a baby food company when I had Ava.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.200]   So there are a lot of things going on.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.240]   And sometimes it's like finding love, right?
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.680]   When you're not looking, it happens.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.560]   And a producer ended up finding me online and was doing a bunch of research.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.400]   He's always creating different shows for one of the biggest production companies.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.180]   And he randomly emailed me during COVID.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.840]   This happened during COVID.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.840]   I was not working.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.720]   I just had Neo probably three months in.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.120]   Everyone's quarantining at home.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.560]   I'm like, "Sure, I'll talk to this guy.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.160]   This is not going to go anywhere."
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.280]   And I had the best conversation with him.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.760]   I really opened up to him maybe because I was home for like...
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.000]   At this point, I was home for already close to six months.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.560]   I was quarantining before I even had Neo, before the shutdown happened, because we had
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.840]   heard about COVID in China and I was pregnant.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   We have a lot of Chinese tourists who come to our restaurant.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.720]   So we're like, "To be safe, you should just stay home."
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.800]   So I was already quarantining.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.400]   At that point, I was not talking to people for close to eight to nine months.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.680]   So maybe that's why I was just like, "Yes, someone to really talk to heart to heart."
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.720]   And it was the best conversation ever.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:49.040]   He really picked up on who I am, the restaurant, the family, the dynamic between my dad.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.360]   And he put together a pitch, a sizzle reel, this is what you put together.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.280]   It's like a deck, right?
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   Elevator pitch, essentially.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.600]   Two minutes, just piecing together things that I've done in the past.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.720]   He didn't shoot anything with me other than our interview via Zoom like this, and sold
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   a show.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.800]   And when we were pitching, I was in Vietnam shooting things.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:16.280]   We had people like another producer put together some footage and all this stuff.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.800]   People were shooting and recording, all this stuff, none of that.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.960]   None of that sold.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.720]   What sold was just this guy finally kind of understanding what's interesting and piecing
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.960]   things together online and sold out of a two-minute sizzle reel.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.640]   And that's how we got Chef Dynasty.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.320]   That's amazing.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.080]   What I'm hearing is things actually just don't happen.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.760]   You have to have a vision and go out there and actually try.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.480]   You got to try, try.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.640]   Usually things don't happen.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.480]   Who knows, if you try long enough, maybe something good will happen.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.680]   Yeah, you got to put it out there.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.960]   I could have easily said, "Hey, no one wants to do this Dandenster.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   Forget about it.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.200]   I'm just going to keep working at the restaurant.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   The restaurant's amazing.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.840]   I get to work with my dad.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.560]   The place is successful.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.560]   Just focus on that."
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   In fact, I think in my culture, not I think, I know in my culture being Chinese, that's
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   always been the way that you would focus on work.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.160]   Me saying, "I want to do food shows and all this stuff," for my dad, it's like, "Let's
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.080]   not think too much.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.740]   Don't try to get your hands into too many things.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.960]   Focus on this one thing, do an amazing job at it, and you'll be successful."
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.240]   And so I was always like, "Well, I feel like we could really do something more."
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   And I'm like, "Okay.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   Well, I'll just compete.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.680]   I'll do whatever it is.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.320]   Just put my name out there and see."
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.040]   If I hadn't done that, if I just gave up and said, "Well, nobody wants to see a Dandenster.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   Don't forget about it.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.320]   I'll just keep working," then James, the producer, wouldn't have found me.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.520]   He found me because I had all this footage out there already and content.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.400]   He found stuff that I had filmed in the past, the cooking competitions, the articles that
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.160]   I used to write for.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.040]   And so he pieced all that together and said, "Okay, this is something interesting."
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.800]   And the quality of the show was excellent.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.100]   It was just as good as any reality show out there that we've ever seen, I've ever seen.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.640]   So kudos to you guys.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.160]   Well, we got lucky because they brought on another producer who did reality shows.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.000]   And so she had done a lot of shows for Bravo.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.360]   She's done stuff for Housewives, Laguna Beach, I don't know if you like the orange OC.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.900]   There's a really popular show back in the day.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.600]   We like watching Love is Blind.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.800]   So they do a lot of shows like that.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.820]   And so the Food Network actually brought in someone who has a lot more experience in producing
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.260]   shows that are in that vein.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.480]   And so we really lucked out on that aspect because I know nothing about putting together
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   a reality show.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.500]   In fact, that wasn't my initial goal to do a reality show.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.180]   My goal was, "Hey, teach people how to cook."
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.180]   Right, right.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.180]   One thing you mentioned was that you've run your business for over 15 years.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.340]   And I remember this because when I left in 2012, I had gone to your restaurant.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.780]   It was one of my favorite restaurants.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.220]   I would go with my colleagues, I'd bring clients there.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.900]   And I can't believe it's been that long and time has flown by so quickly.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:24.340]   To be able to run a restaurant for that long seems to be a very difficult thing.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.360]   What percentage do you think of restaurants last for over 10, 15 years?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.540]   And how do you keep it going?
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.660]   Well, the success rate of restaurants is actually quite low.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:44.540]   I think the National Restaurant Association had put out data recently that only 20% of
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.100]   restaurants succeed.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.660]   And during the first year, about 60% of them fail.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.100]   Within five years, over 80% of those fail.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.220]   And I'm sure that's even worse in San Francisco.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.780]   That's the national average, right?
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.220]   But I think San Francisco, especially as of late, those numbers are probably even more
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.500]   stark than that.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:11.140]   And honestly, it's very difficult because there's so many different factors into running
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.220]   a restaurant.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.860]   And when you think about being able to open one, it's very low barrier to entry, right?
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.100]   Essentially anybody can open a restaurant as long as you have some sort of financial
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.500]   backing if somebody were to help invest or if you saved some money and you wanted to
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.420]   open a small mom and pop shop, right?
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.980]   Even my parents were able to open a place having immigrated from China with not a ton
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.900]   of money, but they were very good about saving.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.140]   You don't need a college degree or anything like that to do it.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.060]   And because of this, I think you have so many different types of people trying to open a
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.500]   very complicated business.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.700]   You need someone who has good financial sense, right?
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.780]   Good business mind, but also a chef.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:00.140]   You need someone who knows how to manage people, someone who's an operations type of person.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.780]   And as a restaurateur or someone who owns a restaurant, oftentimes you are the person
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.420]   who has to do all of those things, right?
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:13.100]   Unless you have a ton of money behind you, then of course you hire the best person to
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.340]   do each category, but that's not how most restaurants run, right?
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.340]   They're not huge conglomerates.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.420]   They're not huge restaurant groups.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.140]   They're usually like a mom and pop standalone startup.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.020]   And that one person has to do all of those things very well.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.380]   You can fail in one area and that would just kill your business.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.060]   So let's say finance wise, you're not good at that.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.180]   And you're an incredible chef.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.740]   If you don't keep track of your finances and your costs, then you don't make money, right?
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.500]   The margins are low when it comes to restaurants.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.740]   Labor is incredibly expensive, especially in San Francisco.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.320]   Food costs is about, I would say an average of 30%.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.460]   Labor is probably up to 40 to 45%.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.400]   And then you've got overhead.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.640]   You've got so much that you have to pay out before you make any money, any kind of profit
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.220]   off of the food that you're selling.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:16.600]   And even within that, there's a lot of fluctuation that you have to manage, even from like inventory,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.060]   something as simple as inventory.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.180]   It fluctuates almost on a weekly basis sometimes, right?
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.440]   People get something delivered to us and there's like sticker shock.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.760]   They're like, "Wait, what happened?"
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.400]   The green beans were, I'm just going to throw that out, the random number, $3 a pound last
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   week.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   Today it's $8 a pound.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.680]   But there's, you know, like we're very involved owners.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.120]   It's pretty rare to see, say like my dad and I, not at the restaurant, especially my dad,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   right?
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.300]   Most owners, I feel like once the place is running and they see customers and they feel
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.440]   like they're smooth, then they're not as hands-on.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.160]   There's no owners who are there basically every single day.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.120]   So then you need to hire, let's say a manager or someone who is keeping an eye on all of
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   your inventory.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.560]   And even then, like they may not notice every single little detail.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.120]   It's just like having the right people.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.720]   There's just so many pieces to making sure something will succeed.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.120]   The way that we've done it has ensured it because we're always there, but that's not
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.320]   the way that everybody does it.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.700]   So it's either you delegate and find people who can do it, but that'll cost you money
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.100]   too or you do it yourself.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   Right.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100]   Right.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.900]   Are there economies of scale given your father runs House of Nanking?
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.140]   No, there's no economies of scale based on the way that we're doing it.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.460]   As far as if we want to expand the restaurant, right?
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.600]   Say we want to open another Fang or another House of Nanking.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.480]   The way that we do it, it's not because we want to have our hands in everything.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.680]   We don't trust being able to hand this over to somebody else to do it quite like we do
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.000]   it in every aspect.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.100]   And that's okay because we actually, we really enjoy being there and talking to customers
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:06.160]   and seeing the reactions and making connections with the people there and creating.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.220]   One of my favorite things to do is talking to customers and making a dish that's not
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.120]   on the menu, just creating it on the spot.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.680]   But it would feel less authentic to the way that we want to do things.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.840]   If let's say I had like three other locations, but I'm like never there and same thing for
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   my dad.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.560]   Now there are other ways that I've been thinking about expanding and that's more like consumer
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.600]   goods where you can do sauces or package noodles or frozen goods and things like that, where
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:42.720]   you can expand and share your food in places where you're not physically at, but it's through
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.740]   a distribution channel where it's not you needing to be at a restaurant and running
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:53.040]   the place, but it's producing a product that can be distributed through channels of say
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.760]   a grocery store or via direct to consumer via online.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.560]   It sounds like a no brainer idea because you've been established for 15 plus years.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.320]   Food is great, one of the best in San Francisco, if not the best Chinese restaurant in San
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   Francisco.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   Thank you.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   Thank you.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   And you've done it.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.680]   So what about that model of creating that consumer product or I think, I mean Martin
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.720]   Yang, did he come up with cooking ware and stuff?
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   Yes.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.480]   Is that a model that's hard to leverage?
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.360]   Because if it is done right, it could be highly scalable.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.360]   Yes.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.280]   So that's something that's really been more of a recent exploration for me.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.440]   My dad's kind of at the point where he's 74.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.600]   My dad is very happy with where he's at.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.160]   He's not looking to expand, start anything else.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.560]   He just wants to go to work every single day and complete his routine.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.400]   For me, it's different, right?
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:02.080]   I am at this point, I'm in my forties and I still have a couple of years where I'm still
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.400]   quite hungry to want to do more.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.200]   And so number one, we're going to work on a cookbook together, a father-daughter cookbook,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.680]   which has always been a passion of mine.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.040]   And that's one project that I need to like check off my bucket list.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.840]   And the other thing is really like trying to explore this idea of packaged products.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.960]   I think this is really the way to extend our legacy is if we want to grow from these two
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.840]   restaurants, what's that next step?
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.160]   It's definitely not open more restaurants.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   It's creating packaged goods.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.840]   But from the research that I've done so far, it is not as easy as one would think.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.660]   It's highly costly upfront to try to do it yourself because not only do you have to put
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:52.120]   in the money to create all the products, you work with various vendors to package, to delivery,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.080]   to warehouse, storage, logistics.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.520]   There's a lot involved with even something as basic as say making oatmeal or something
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.520]   like that.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:07.480]   And so I know a lot of people and friends who are in that space and I see like it is
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.900]   very, very difficult to make money off of that.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:18.160]   And so now I'm thinking more in terms of are there ways to do this in a collaborative space
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:25.760]   where you're doing these co-labs with other established brands and companies in specific
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.600]   fields, whether that's like a beverage company or a frozen goods company where, "Hey, what
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.040]   we want to do is give you our recipe and our branding.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.020]   The product is actually yours.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.460]   You are producing and manufacturing and doing all of that.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:48.620]   And we simply take a small percentage off of the sales versus us making all of it and
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.360]   we sell it and make the majority of the profit ourself."
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.960]   We're saying, "We don't need the majority of it.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.200]   We don't need to do all that.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.920]   We just give you the name and the recipe."
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   Right.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.420]   No, I mean, that sounds good.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.400]   You add it to your current product line, right?
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.640]   So we're basically adding on to their product line.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.760]   We're not creating a product line of our own from ground zero.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.840]   Right.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.160]   What about, I mean, fang is such a great word as well.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.180]   I mean, it seems like such a great way to brand it because it has multiple meanings
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.180]   as well.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:32.320]   I mean, what about the fang knife, the ultimate life for the connoisseur cook or something
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   like that?
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.340]   So, I mean, there's many different angles of going about this.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.040]   When I first started thinking about doing this stand and stir, teach people how to cook,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.940]   there was also this whole idea of being the Asian version of Martha Stewart, right?
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:53.960]   Creating a whole lifestyle cookware line where when you think about entertaining through
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:22:01.640]   an Asian sort of perspective, then you can say go to Williams and Sonoma or go to Macy's
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:08.420]   and find Asian inspired cookware, linens, tableware, and things like that.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.760]   That's actually from an Asian chef, not from Martha Stewart, right?
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.060]   That's one thing that's still, I think, very disappointing is that let's say you do go
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.860]   to a Williams Sonoma.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:27.120]   I do see a lot of Asian motif decor, but it's from some Western person, right?
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:33.480]   Why is it not an Asian person who gets to represent the Asian motif cookware or the
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   Asian motif vases?
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:41.660]   I remember two years ago, I was walking in there for Lunar New Year, and they had this
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.560]   candy tray and this cocktail tray, and it had this beautiful Ming Dynasty decor on it,
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.440]   but it was like Kathy Ireland or something like that.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.480]   I'm like, "What, really?
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:59.600]   You can't pick a notable Chinese person who's in the food space to represent that or design
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   it?"
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.040]   It's kind of mind-blowing to me.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   Even now, you would still struggle to find stuff like that represented within that culture
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.880]   in Target or anywhere or Macy's.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.360]   I mean, that has to change.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.920]   Well, it sounds like you've got to fill that hole, Kathy.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.840]   Well, I mean, one thing at a time, I'd love to do that, but there's so many different
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.440]   things and now I have two kids, so.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   Right.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.120]   Well, speaking of kids, because I also have two kids and our kids go to the same school,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.520]   it is tough being a parent.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]   Would you agree?
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   Yes.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.800]   It is way tougher than running a restaurant for me.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   And I agree.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.120]   I've said this on Financial Samurai before, a day job is easy compared to raising kids,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   at least in the first five years of life.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.320]   If I'm trying to understand how do you run a restaurant, because the hours are not your
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.240]   normal corporate job hours, and how do you have the energy to take care of your kids
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   as well?
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.920]   How does that day go about for you?
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.920]   I have to say I'm very lucky and fortunate that I have a lot of help.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:16.600]   I have a nanny, I have an assistant, I've got my parents, although they work just as
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:23.680]   much as I do, they're always able to step in and say something, like let's say the kids
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.000]   are sick, right?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.640]   And the nanny can't help, and my husband also works a ton, and none of us can stay home
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.880]   because I can't remote work this, like I need to actually be at the restaurant, my mom can
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.480]   always help chip in and whatnot.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.680]   So it really does take a village.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:45.200]   I honestly don't know how a restaurant or a chef who's a mom can actually do it without
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.600]   the help because the hours are not conducive for being a parent, right?
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.000]   Although my mornings are free, and that's why I take my kids to school every morning,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.320]   and I make their breakfast and lunch, and I love that time, although it's really crazy
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.560]   and frustrating, I make sure that I do that with them.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.280]   And I also try to make sure I can pick them up from school, right?
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:12.240]   With restaurants, my hours are generally about, I start doing emails and work around 10, and
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   then I have to go to the restaurant, I finish about 1.30 or 2, then I grab a really quick
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.000]   lunch, do some more emails, take calls, and then I go pick up my kids so I can spend a
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.960]   little time with them before I head back to work.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   And when I head back to work, that's usually around 5.30, and then I don't get back until
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.440]   it can vary between 8.30 to 10 p.m.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.680]   So sometimes I miss my kids' bedtime, right?
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.040]   I try to get back by 8.30 to see them before they go to sleep so I can say goodnight, but
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.880]   if I miss that mark, then I don't see them.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:51.240]   So it is quite hard, but energy-wise, I would say a lot of times I don't feel like I have
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.520]   the energy to deal with both, but you just kind of do it, right?
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.240]   You muster it up, and when I see my kids, I do get very excited.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.080]   They're draining, but it provides you this sort of happiness, right?
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.440]   It's like the change of scenery, the change of pace.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.440]   I'm working.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.360]   I'm dealing with a lot of drama that's going on there, then I switch gears.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   I switch mode.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.360]   I pick up my kids.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.960]   Totally different kind of vibe, and then when the kids are a bit much, I can leave, right?
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.880]   Then I go back to the restaurant, then it's a totally different vibe.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.640]   There's a benefit to it, right?
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.320]   If you're remote and you're home, it's always there.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.720]   If your kids are having a meltdown, they're having a really bad day, going into your office
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.540]   is not enough sometimes.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.600]   You're banging on that door and you're just like, "I just need 10 minutes."
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.720]   Oh my gosh, you bring up an amazing point because I just read an article about whether
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.400]   to rent out my old house or sell it or create a wellness center out of it, and the idea
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.880]   was I escaped to that house just for one day, being totally unproductive, sitting in silent,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.720]   writing, and it was so healing because I don't have a day job and I don't have anywhere kind
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.240]   of to go to escape the chaos that is parenthood sometimes.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.640]   So that actually is pretty good.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.720]   You have like two centers there you can go to, but then sometimes it can be chaos on
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.320]   both sides, right?
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.200]   Getting back so late, I guess has your body become accustomed to these hours after so
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   many years, 15 plus years?
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Yes.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.880]   My body at this point is, it's been trained.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.200]   It's been trained for these types of hours.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.320]   I actually don't really mind it, minus having the kids.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:40.560]   If I didn't have kids, I could do this forever, but with kids, I've definitely noticed my
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.000]   energy is different, right?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.520]   In the morning, I'm more sluggish because I've got to deal with so much more.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.600]   I feel like by the time I drop off my kids, a full day's already happened.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.840]   They can be draining just trying to get them out the door.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.240]   And then I have to do work, right?
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.600]   Work at the restaurant is not only mentally tiring, but also physically.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.400]   I think sometimes people don't realize the physical aspect of it.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.280]   You're on your feet a lot of times, 10 to 12 hours a day.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.360]   My restaurant is three stories, so I'm always going up and down the stairs, you're lifting
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.800]   heavy things, you're in a very hot environment, steam, fires, you can get hurt.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.400]   There's just so much movement.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.340]   So like if we have a conference week, everybody by that end of the week, you're sore.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.960]   You feel like you've run a marathon or have been working out every single day.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.480]   So it's physically exhausting, it's mentally exhausting.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.760]   I mean, I can't stand honestly for more than an hour and I don't understand how you can
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   stand for 10 hours.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.240]   I mean, you must have like super legs or super feet where you're just like, you know.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.960]   Your body gets used to it.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.440]   But then see, the problem is I can't sit for very long.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:59.220]   So because my body has acclimated to standing so much that I actually prefer standing.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.160]   There's a lot of circumstances where we're with people or with friends and they'll be
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   like, "Oh, sit."
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.600]   I'm like, "No, I prefer to stand."
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.280]   Because that's my natural state.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.240]   If I sit for too long, my back starts to hurt.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.480]   So I actually think when people do office jobs and have to sit and hover and type, my
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.480]   back, my shoulder, like everything starts to hurt.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.240]   It just takes like about two hours and I'm like, "Oh, how do people do this?"
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.360]   So grass is always greener on the other side.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   I don't know.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   Well, no.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   For this, that term wouldn't work.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.240]   It would just be like, yeah, we think that the other is more difficult, but...
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.240]   That's so funny.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   No, I mean, yeah.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   10, 12 hours.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.560]   I mean, I guess that's good for fitness then.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.160]   Yes, I clock in a lot of steps.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.920]   I don't know what will happen if I stop working and moving around.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:52.600]   If I clock in 15,000, 20,000 steps a day, and I go from, "Oh, I don't have to work anymore,"
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.920]   and I sit all the time, how do I make up for all of that?
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.400]   Well, maybe it'll be good because you won't be surrounded by food so much.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.080]   Because I'm assuming you're always tasting your food too.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.080]   Or is there a point where you're just like...
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   I am tasting.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   You're like, okay.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.640]   You're not overeating just because food is everywhere because...
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.840]   I don't overeat, but I do taste.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   Right.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.240]   So there's a lot of meals there where it becomes, "Oh, yeah."
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Right, right.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.160]   No, actually, I have experience standing in front of a hot stove because I used to work
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.200]   at McDonald's flipping the burgers, quarter pounders, McMuffins.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.640]   I would drop some patties on the ground sometimes, and then I put it back into the heater.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.960]   Sorry, guys, from 25 years ago or 30 years ago.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   But it's a lot.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.300]   The oil is splattering.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.640]   People are yelling at you.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:46.000]   And so I really respect the physical, intense nature of getting great dishes out in a timely
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   manner too.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.960]   And the pressure is always on.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.680]   I mean, it is.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.120]   Now I want to know, can you make all of that at home for your kids?
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:01.960]   You'd be like, "Listen, Dad can make an egg McMuffin just like McDonald's, but even better."
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   Sure.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   Why not?
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.680]   I mean, I can.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   I do a mean scrambled egg and stuff like that.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   But you know, the thing about cooking for me is I play a lot of tennis and pickleball.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:18.120]   So I have cut my fingers and had oil splattered on me many times before.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.000]   And then as soon as I do that, I can't play my love of my life, these games that make
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.320]   me happy.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.400]   And so I decided I just don't have the skills to chop without injuring myself one out of
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.760]   10 times.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   And so I stopped.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.680]   I mean, have your injuries, do you get injured cooking?
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   I do.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:44.000]   I would say I probably get injured a little less than most chefs because I actually spend
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.400]   a lot of my time outside of the kitchen these days.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.280]   I'm always interacting with people, but I'd say I probably cook 30% of my time at the
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   restaurant.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.240]   And it's usually when we're really busy and we call it in the weeds, right?
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.080]   Like the chefs are swamped, they can't keep up with the tickets.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.960]   Then I go in and I cook and I help try to pound out as many dishes or I make things
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.400]   that are off menu.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.720]   Someone has a very specific diet, I'll do that.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:17.000]   So under those circumstances, I'll get injured here and there, but probably not as often
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.360]   as most chefs do.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.400]   I mean, you always get burned, you get cuts.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.680]   Those happen here and there, but there's some gnarly, gnarly accidents that I know that
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:35.560]   other chefs get, and it's not pretty, but my worst is probably I had a large pot of
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:43.160]   soup spill onto my legs and it went into my shoe and got trapped in my shoe.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.840]   It was like boiling that came right off the stove.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.520]   So by the time I took off my shoe and my sock, I had like a pretty serious burn on it, went
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.640]   to like the emergency room.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.600]   And my foot, I couldn't wear a shoe for a week because the blister on the foot was like
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   huge.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.020]   Oh my goodness.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.720]   Things like that are pretty common.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.000]   Some people get them on their hands.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.800]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.360]   So your dad is 74, you said, and you said you have several more years into you.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.120]   Are you sure you don't have like 30 more years like your dad into grinding?
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   Oh my God, I don't want to do that.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.360]   It's like different mentality, I think.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.560]   For my parents, you know, they're immigrants, and so that's all they know how to do.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.400]   There's no such thing as balance, right?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.920]   My parents also never really took care of me.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.740]   They were always working on the restaurant, and so they benefited from having brothers
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.200]   and sisters all take turns taking care of me.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.740]   They don't know what to do if they were not to work.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.040]   And I used to be pretty frustrated and say, "Why are you guys working so hard?
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.020]   You don't even need to work anymore, retire, live a good life."
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:58.600]   And then when COVID happened, I realized that it was bad for their health to actually retire
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.560]   because they were forced into retirement for about a year and a half.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.200]   And health-wise, they deteriorated very quickly.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.920]   Was it like a mental?
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   Blood pressure.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   Oh, physical too?
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.240]   No, it's like, yeah, physical, blood pressure, diabetes, everything was going through the
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.480]   roof because when you're at home, nothing else to do but eat.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.320]   And so they were like cooking and eating and, you know, you get bored.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   And so, and they were not exercising like they normally are where they're always walking
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.360]   and moving and using their brains.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.840]   They were just sitting.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.480]   They're sitting, they lost strength in their legs to walk.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:40.680]   My dad lost his voice because he wasn't using his vocal cords and they were sleeping so
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.640]   much that their memory was getting foggy.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.660]   And that just happened within a year of retirement.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:54.520]   So now we've all realized that as long as they're not stressed out and they're just
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.360]   working because they need a purpose, right?
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.440]   They need an activity, something to keep them busy.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.520]   My dad always wants to do this handiworks and projects, even though the restaurant's
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   already busy.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.460]   He's like, "Oh, I want to fix this lantern."
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.280]   I'm like, "Hire somebody, it's like a waste of your time."
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.240]   But what I realized is like my dad likes it.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.040]   It's like a challenge for him.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.080]   And then it's like, he's like thinking he has to use his hands, he has to try to be
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   nimble.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.800]   So he fixed a lantern.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   He does all these little weird projects and now I don't get upset anymore.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   I used to get frustrated.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.160]   I'm like, "Spend the money and hire somebody to do it.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.520]   Stop doing it yourself."
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.920]   Now I'm like, "Wonderful, found another hobby and another little project to do."
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:42.300]   So yeah, like that's my dad, but we come from a different generation, right?
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:48.800]   Now a lot of what we grew up from is about balance, finding balance in your life.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.840]   And so I don't want to work that way.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:56.080]   I don't want to be walking to work and doing the same thing when I'm 70.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.840]   In fact, I think I'm ready in maybe five to seven years to really take it easy and spend
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.520]   more time being a parent, spending more time with my kids.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.520]   I think that's great.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.040]   And the thing is, you've done it, you're a restaurateur, you've done it for 15 plus years.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.600]   Our kids are only going to be with us for so long and then they're gone, right?
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.840]   18, 19 years old, the see you later parents.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.560]   And maybe what's the statistic that says something like only 10% of the remaining time we spend
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.400]   with our children is after they are 18, 19 years old.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.400]   So sad.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   I know.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.120]   I mean, that's the thing that I am starting to struggle with is that right now it seems
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:41.760]   okay because my kids want to spend time with me, but they're also kind of used to, "Oh,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.760]   okay.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.280]   Well, mommy's not here at night and whatnot."
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.000]   But what I'm also seeing is the independence that's happening, especially with my first
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.360]   child, right?
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.920]   She wants to do things herself and all that and I'm seeing the big change already.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.360]   And I really don't want to miss out on all of that.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.520]   And it goes by so quickly.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.600]   And like you said, once they hit 18 and they're out the door, but a lot of parents are saying
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.720]   their kids at 12 and 13 already don't want to spend time with their parents.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.240]   That window is so small.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:14.880]   If I miss out on that window, then that's something money can't buy back.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.120]   And I can put a pause to what I'm doing if I wanted to.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:25.480]   I feel like I'm at that point where I'm very happy with what I've been able to accomplish
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.120]   and everything is quite stable.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.800]   So if I wanted to step away and let's say not be as hands-on, things will still be okay.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.120]   FANG will still be around.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.320]   House of Nanking will still be around.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.920]   But the benefit is I can actually really hone in on that time with my kids before they say,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:49.080]   "I don't want you in my room," which I hope that will not happen.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:55.720]   But that's just sometimes I'm very envious, I think, of parents who've already started
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:00.480]   on that path where they're already just home, spending time with their kids.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.640]   Because that's really something, like I said, money can't buy that time back for you.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   Right.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.880]   Well, I have to say, I feel what you are doing is very admirable.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.960]   It's so much work to be an entrepreneur, to be a restauranteur, and I really want to thank
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.840]   you for your time and just keep it up.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.160]   I've been going to a restaurant for 15 years.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.200]   It's the best Chinese restaurant in San Francisco.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.320]   And I hope all listeners, when they go to San Francisco, go visit Fang Restaurant as
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   well.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.720]   For listeners who want to see what you're up to or keep in touch, where should they
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.840]   find you?
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.220]   They can go to Chef Kathy Fang.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.700]   That's my Instagram handle, or they can go to KathyFang.com, which is my website.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.700]   All right, Kathy.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.580]   Well, I hope you have a good rest of the day and pickup goes well and smoothly for you.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   And I'll see you around.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.580]   Thank you.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   Yes.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.580]   Have a great day.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.580]   It was fun chatting with you.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.580]   Yeah, good chatting.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.580]   All right, everyone.
