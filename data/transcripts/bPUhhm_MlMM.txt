[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Well, welcome to our Q&A.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   These are always my favorite parts, but it's always where I get in trouble too.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.040]   So I'm going to try to stay out of trouble this time.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.480]   And I want to say, Ken, I don't think anyone objected that you went a little bit over time.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:28.000]   The only thing that disappointed me was that you used the day-age theory to justify it.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Well, no, because I was being consistent.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.560]   You see, because I compromised my time, I had to use a compromising argument.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.980]   Okay, we'll accept that.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.500]   We'll accept that.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.920]   Well, the only person I haven't introduced here yet is Mike, Mike Riccardi, who is my
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.940]   fellow pastor.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660]   We jointly pastor a group at Grace Community Church.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820]   So he's on the pastoral staff at Grace Church, one of the younger guys on staff there.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.820]   And I will introduce him.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.880]   I'm going to try to get him better and more extensively than that before he speaks.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.380]   But I just wanted to point out that all three of you, all three of you began in ministry
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.140]   at a very young age and reached a level of success at a young age.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.040]   Ken, tell us, how old were you when you first began in public ministry of any kind?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.700]   I don't know if it was open air preaching, tract ministry, or if you began preaching
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.700]   in churches.
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640]   How did your ministry begin, and when was it?
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   Well, actually, I gave my first ministry.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.640]   I gave my first talk on creation apologetics in 1975.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.880]   So I would have been about six or seven back then.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.640]   Okay.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   Are we using the day-age theory again?
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:53.800]   So, but 1975, I actually became a teacher in the public school in Australia, in a little
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.460]   country town.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.460]   So I was 24 years old.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460]   I was 23 years old, actually.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.820]   And the church had what they called an exchange weekend, where they exchanged with a city
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.040]   church and exchanged their youth groups.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.660]   And so the youth group of the church we were at went to that church, and I was the leader,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.660]   so I spoke.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.660]   And I spoke on creation apologetics.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.460]   And I gave the same talk in our church as well.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.460]   And it's interesting.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.460]   I was a pastor.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.580]   that one of the things that happened after I gave that talk was so many people came up
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.700]   to me in the church and said, "We didn't know you could believe Genesis. We thought you
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.280]   had to believe in evolution." And you know, the Lord used that as a part of really bringing
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.640]   me into the ministry today.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.960]   I'm glad He did. All right, well our theme in this conference is "Recovering a Christian
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.580]   Worldview," and Ken used the word worldview and defined it, I think, pretty well with
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.760]   a simple thumbnail definition that our worldview is how we see and understand the world around
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.080]   us. Would you say that's a fair definition?
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.040]   Yes, it is your way of thinking that you use to understand everything around you.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.960]   And I explain to people, it's like putting on a pair of glasses, and we've got to make
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.320]   sure we've got on biblical glasses so we have the right foundation, the right way of thinking,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.560]   so you're seeing everything in terms of biblical history and the foundation of the
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.600]   foundation that God has given us.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.520]   You agree with that, John? It's a good definition of worldview.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.260]   Yeah, I think David said, "I have set the Lord always before me." He viewed the world
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.640]   through his theology, through the revelation of God.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.680]   You hear a lot of talk these days about Christian worldview, but unfortunately I think a lot
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.660]   of people who talk about it have something different in mind. They're trying to blend
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.540]   theology with Christian themes or theology.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.000]   Christian theological ideas, that's not a Christian worldview though, right, if I understand
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   what you're saying.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.800]   Well, look, a truly Christian worldview demands an accurate interpretation of Scripture
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.700]   at every point. You can't say, "I don't exactly know what Genesis means. Maybe we can't know
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.880]   that." Call yourself a theologian. You can't be unclear about any doctrine. You can't be
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.520]   unclear about the gospel. You can't be unclear about the gospel. You can't be unclear about
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.560]   clear as Ken pointed out in all the matters of Genesis, you can't have a Christian worldview
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.200]   if you can't handle the scripture accurately. So, the worldview rises from a true interpretation
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.400]   of Scripture. You know, one of the problems too I see out there - and here's a test you
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   can do - but if you check children's books; most of the Christian children's books that
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.280]   we use actually are indoctrinating our kids in the wrong way of thinking through many
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.640]   of the illustrations. For instance, I just spoke at a home school conference that we
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.680]   had here, and I used some examples from kids' books where they said, "God made this beautiful
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.280]   world we live in." Well, there's a big problem, because this is not a beautiful world. There's
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.600]   beauty but there's ugliness, because it's a fallen world. And what the atheists do - and
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.220]   I've seen it so many times - your church told you, your parents told you that God made
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.880]   this world? Well, then what about all the death and suffering and disease we see? So
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.060]   they need to understand it was once all beautiful, but now it's fallen. And then you see in many
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.000]   other things - you know, there's the bathtub arcs - instead of having Noah's ark look like
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.080]   it really was, as the dimensions are given in the Bible. Or, often, you'll see most likely
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.440]   when they have an illustration of the Garden of Eden, they'll have domestic animals that
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.400]   we have today in there. But you see, God made the original kinds. Those animals have developed
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.120]   since the flood, the different species, from the kinds that were taken on the ark. Why
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.560]   is this important? Because the evolutionists, over and over again, you'll see them say,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.600]   "Oh, speciation is evolution. You were taught by your parents that God made all the animals
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.840]   we see today, but these have developed in the last few hundred years, these different
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.880]   species." And they can capture their minds and they say, "See, evolution's true, because
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.280]   we haven't taught them the right way."
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.500]   So, we need to make sure we're teaching a biblical worldview in every area, and make
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.400]   sure that even the books we're using really are accurate in regard to biblical worldview.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.440]   Yeah, that's a great point, because it is, I think, a common approach to teaching
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.620]   children spiritual truth, to simplify it as much as possible, make it as positive as possible,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.040]   and almost treat it like fantasy. And kids grow up with that idea.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.120]   Well, you know, I know there's a lot of churches - I hope I'm not insulting
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.720]   your church, whoever you're from - I don't know most of you, so that's good.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.040]   But a lot of churches I go to have Noah's Ark as a bathtub ark on the kindergarten walls,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.440]   or they have a model of a bathtub ark. And as I say, it's cute, but it's dangerous.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.120]   Because, again, the secularists use that to say, "Noah couldn't get all the animals on
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.880]   the ark." And you have giraffes sticking out the chimney about to sink at any moment and
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.240]   overloaded. That's one of the reasons we have an exhibit against that there in the ark on
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.960]   the second deck.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.400]   And the other point you made about worldview is that Scripture is the foundation.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.080]   I mean, your illustration even showed that. What do we need to believe about Scripture
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.000]   in order to have a proper worldview? Because there are lots of false churches, as we pointed
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.940]   out, and most of them would say they believe the Bible at some level. Even the people you
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.100]   quoted, they would all claim to have some kind of fidelity to the Bible. What precisely
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.800]   do we have to believe about it?
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.000]   What is the right start in forming a Christian worldview?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.640]   Doesn't Dr. MacArthur teach on that every Sunday? Haven't you been to some of his services?
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:13.380]   The conversation always comes back to the authority of Scripture. So you have to believe
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:22.640]   that it is an inerrant, divinely inspired revelation from God. And that is what Scripture
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:33.880]   attests. This is not a human book. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God. It is God breathed
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:43.380]   out the revelation. Every word of God is perfect. The Word of God is pure, like a silver refined
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.280]   seven times in a furnace. So you have to start with an inerrant, original
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   autograph and understand that God not only gave it that way, but He protected it so that
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   it could be a perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect,
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect. And that is what we have,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   is essentially a reflection of the original. So if you have any weakness in your conviction
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:10.640]   about biblical authority, then you're subject to anything and everything else. Whenever
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.380]   I used to get on television and debate people, secular people, it was always a question of
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:22.320]   authority. What's your authority? I debated Gavin Newsom, the governor of California,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:30.200]   and he had just signed a law for homosexual marriage in San Francisco. And he was advocating
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.360]   homosexual marriage, and he made the comment to me, "Well, I'm also a Christian. I'm also
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.340]   a Christian." So I said, "Really? Well, that's good to know. Then you must believe the Bible
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:48.020]   is the Word of God. Would that be true?" To which he replied, "Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.160]   because he knew he couldn't say yes." That's his reply to a lot of
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:00.200]   hard questions. It is. I think I helped him develop that reply. But it's always authority
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.600]   in any of those discussions. What's your authority? Why would I believe you? Why would I believe
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:13.560]   you? Why would I believe scientists when they weren't there? Creation is not explained
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:22.000]   scientifically in the first case because it's not normal, observable science. It was a
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.620]   miracle. A six-day creation has no scientific explanation, no more than a resurrection,
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.040]   no more than an axe head floating on water, no more than walking on water. There is no
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:40.680]   scientific explanation for the most massive miracle in history, and that was the creation
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.300]   in six days. Science has nothing to say about creation,
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:51.840]   and why would they when it's impossible to observe something that you can't see and couldn't
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.120]   see? And especially when you have an eyewitness account from the Creator Himself, why call
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.560]   that into question? Now, you used the word "inerrancy"
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.240]   several times, and that's where most of the debate over the past fifty years has been
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.840]   with regard to the authority of Scripture. It's a lengthy debate about biblical inerrancy.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.800]   I think all four of us would affirm unequivocally that Scripture is inerrant in every part.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.680]   There are no errors of any kind in it, neither scientific
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.800]   nor geographical nor historical nor factual errors, no errors in Scripture. We would all
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   affirm that, right? Yes.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.320]   And it's... Said the guy with the tie.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:43.500]   I'm working my way in here. All right, good. I'm glad. I'm glad.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.920]   We need to hear more from you. No, that's all I got.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.520]   I was wondering why he hadn't asked you a question. I realize it's because
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.680]   you're wearing a tie. You guys are trying to appeal to the younger
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.640]   generation. When I'm wearing a tie.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:07.520]   In Judges, doesn't it say, "If you tie me up, I will become weak"? I might have misquoted
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.480]   slightly. I have questions for him, but I know from
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.520]   experience that when you ask him a question, he filibusters. So I'm saving it for the end.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.360]   Those are Q&As that I do with Phil. That's right.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.480]   Not when John MacArthur and Ken Hammer are on the scene.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:32.280]   So one of the big battles over biblical inerrancy took place in the 1970s and '80s.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.760]   And I remember actually, John, one of the first times I ever had a lot of face-to-face
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.920]   interaction with you was at this massive convention with the Council on Biblical Inerrancy in San
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:50.280]   Diego. And one of the decisions that was made at that meeting in San Diego, and I'm guessing, Ken,
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.200]   you would disagree very much with that. You would disagree very much with that.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.640]   I would disagree vehemently with this. They decided, the Council decided that you can
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:05.020]   hold to biblical inerrancy and believe that the earth is ages old. They wanted to juggle
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.880]   both positions. In my opinion, even then, I thought that's a mistake. Would you agree
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   with that?
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.380]   Absolutely. And see, one of the things I mentioned in the presentation I gave, we have to understand
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.040]   that the idea of millions of years came out of naturalism. And really, the naturalism
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.140]   of the 1800s, that's really what has been the key to understand why so many have walked away from
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.820]   biblical inerrancy. And it's the age of the earth issue. It's interesting. You can find, I find
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:38.920]   many, many pastors, Christian leaders, who will even be adamant on Adam and Eve, but when it comes
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.160]   to the age of the earth, that's where they waver, or the days of creation because of the age of the
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:50.880]   earth issue. And it, for many of them, I don't know what it is, but I think some of it is, you
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.540]   know, the age of the earth is even academic pride, and they'll be mocked at and scoffed at if you
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.780]   believe in six literal days and a young earth. But, and they haven't thought through the issue of death
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.700]   and disease before sin, because every time I've challenged some of these theologians on that issue,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.500]   they sort of shrug their shoulders or won't answer about how can you have diseases like cancer before
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:20.720]   sin? You know, how do you justify that? But they don't have an answer. They just don't. But they think that the overwhelming
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.700]   evidence is there's millions of years, but see, all dating methods are based on fallible assumptions.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.600]   And there's hundreds and hundreds of dating methods. There's only one infallible dating
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.340]   method, and that's God's Word. And that's the point. And you know, as we're talking about this
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.780]   issue before, and you mentioned about some of those people I quoted and how they compromised
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:45.560]   Genesis and so on. To me, what I look for, the key I look for is, are they bringing something into
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   Scripture from the outside, or are they starting from Scripture? I guess we could say, is it eisegesis
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.900]   or exegesis? Because what you find is, whenever you talk to these people, where'd you get the
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.460]   millions of years from? Where'd you get? It's always outside of Scripture. You know, when you, I know there
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:06.760]   are people that might argue over issues of eschatology or baptism or, you know, some of those issues.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.040]   Primarily they argue from Scripture. Obviously not all are right, but they do primarily argue
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.940]   from Scripture. When it comes to Genesis, the reason there's all these different interpretations,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.400]   they always start outside of Scripture. And that's what I look for.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.760]   Yeah, I know John has said the same thing. That is the problem with all of the attempts to
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.120]   accommodate an old age to the earth. But that's pretty deeply ingrained even in evangelical
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   history. Spurgeon, for example, believed in the gap theory.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:43.800]   Yeah, I find many of the greats of the past were gap theorists. You know, Spurgeon talked about
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:49.020]   millions of years and two sermons in particular. Even Martin Lloyd-Jones, you know, he's one of my
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.240]   favorite preachers.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.500]   Of the past.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:16:01.100]   It would have been okay. It's one of John's favorite preachers too, so.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:07.880]   Martin Lloyd-Jones toyed with the gap theory in a couple of his sermons, but you could tell he
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.220]   was struggling with it and didn't really want to accept it. But a lot of those great men of the
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:19.280]   past were gap theorists. And you know, many of them were great preachers and loved the Lord and
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   His Word. And, you know, I don't look on them, but I don't look on them. I don't look on them
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.580]   because I look on it that many of them, I think if they knew what we knew today, they'd realize,
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.740]   wow, you can't do that. I don't think they thought through the issue of disease in the fossil record,
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.560]   because it wasn't documented at that stage anyway. And I don't think they really understood
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.000]   what was going on for a lot of them. So for them, it was easy. Just throw it in a gap between Genesis
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.920]   1:1 and 1:2. And of course, he gets in the Schofield Reference Bible and gets in the notes.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.920]   And as my father always taught me, remember the notes are not inspired like the text and the text
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.620]   should be used as the commentary on the notes and not the other way around.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.100]   It is not in the MacArthur Study Bible though, is it?
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:03.780]   No. I want to just gild the lily a little bit here and say, I'm often asked, the Master's
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:11.520]   University is 95 years old, and it has never wavered in its commitment to the absolute authority
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:19.760]   of Scripture, an inerrant text and a sufficient text. And when people ask me, how has this university stayed true
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:27.980]   for 95 years? My answer has always been the same. It is because of our convictions about the veracity
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:35.460]   of Genesis 1 to 11. You saw an illustration of that right here. Every single issue that causes
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:42.480]   the church to cave into the world is already settled in Genesis. And we've lived a hundred
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.600]   years of that history. Every faculty member, every staff member, I don't care whatever their discipline might be,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:59.360]   signs annually a document affirming from the heart the veracity of the account in Genesis 1 to 11
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:08.780]   because this is the foundation of absolutely everything in the Word of God. And also it is the most assaulted
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:19.440]   portion of Scripture because it's where science gets away with the most anti-God effort. And holding that will
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.160]   hold everything. And it's done it for almost a century.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:30.260]   Yeah, I know you would agree with Ken's assessment too about the importance of Genesis 1 through 11.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:38.080]   You preached last night from Isaiah 53. It's one of the few passages in the Old Testament that you've
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.880]   actually preached verse by verse through a lengthy text. And one of the others is Genesis 1 through
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:49.280]   11, which you preached through. So you'd agree with his assessment that that's
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.780]   foundational in every way. I know I've heard you talk about this.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.680]   Oh, no question.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.340]   Phil, it's Isaiah.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.160]   I didn't hear that.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.300]   It's Isaiah.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.280]   Oh, he's trying to get you to pronounce it right. The "i" is more in the middle.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.320]   Yes, I'm sorry. I don't speak Australian.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.520]   That's okay.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.160]   I'm just trying to teach you English.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.120]   All right.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   So shouldn't he say yes again?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   Yes.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   How do you pronounce Isaiah?
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   I say it like you. Isaiah.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.120]   All right. I'll work on that though. Isaiah.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.080]   I think one thing to say is that you can't come to this issue and think that you
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:48.960]   have these scientists and these, you know, theoreticians who are just these neutral servants,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.900]   who want to bring to the issue. I'm just concerned to follow the evidence, right? Romans 1 tells
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:03.080]   us that those upon whom the wrath of God comes, they suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.680]   And so there is an unrighteous motive for finding an alternative to the origin of creation,
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.560]   the origin of man that God Himself gives us in His Word. And it's if I can figure out
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.800]   a way to undermine the veracity of this account and this story, I can do it. And I can do
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   it.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.780]   If I can do it in this Scripture, then I don't need to deal with a holy God who disapproves
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:31.540]   of me and my sin. Let me sin in peace. Well, I can't do that consistently or with any peace
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:37.840]   unless I can attack those foundations. And so these alternative theories are not sort
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.820]   of neutral presentations of the facts. They are agenda-driven, world-view-driven, with
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.640]   a specific agenda to undercut the God of the Bible.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.040]   You know, that's a really important point.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.760]   And the number of times that I've spoken to Christian leaders, and like one Christian
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:08.020]   leader, he said to me, "But surely the earth must be millions of years old." I mean, the
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.880]   majority of scientists believe this. He said, "Surely the majority couldn't be so wrong."
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.480]   And I said, "Well, Pastor, the Bible says men love darkness rather than light." He said,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.240]   "Surely the majority couldn't be so wrong." And the majority, it's millions of years old.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.360]   And I said, "Well, the Bible says there's more on the broad way than the narrow way."
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.560]   And he says, "Surely the majority couldn't be so wrong." And I said, "Look, the majority
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.200]   didn't survive the flood either."
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.560]   And to be honest, when it comes to the origins issue, if the majority believes something,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.540]   I'm immediately suspicious because of the heart of man. Immediately suspicious rather
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.320]   than like William Lane Craig.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.360]   It's the majority. We should be appealing to God's Word, not man's Word.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.740]   Yeah, I was going to save this question until later, but let me ask it now, because
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:07.720]   it seems to me that the COVID crisis has really sort of helped to debunk the widespread notion
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.280]   that the scientific consensus is always right, because now we see it's fluid, it changes
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.160]   all the time. I mean, masks do no good, and then they're essential, and now you should
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.500]   wear two masks, and now we're mandated to wear masks. And science, supposedly, is telling
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.540]   us all of this, but it shifts constantly. Talk about that.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.740]   It's your turn.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.920]   Yeah, Ken, you first. You first.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:40.200]   Right. So I think the foundational thing, and Mike hits on it, and obviously Ken as
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:48.000]   well, it is not rational to believe nobody times nothing equals everything.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.860]   It is not rational to believe you have this massive cause, massive effect of the universe
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:06.760]   with no cause. We talk about chance. This happened by chance, and then this happened
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:14.700]   by chance. And literally, chance is not a power. It is only a way to observe something
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.840]   that you can't make an obvious connection to.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   So chance has no power, and yet the assumption is no one, nothing, and chance creates a universe.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:34.060]   That's insane. You have to have a cause. And it goes back to those basic arguments: you
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.080]   can't have a watch without a watchmaker, blah, blah, and so forth. So I think the insanity
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:46.680]   has to accommodate some other reason. If you're going to live in a reprobate mind, you've
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   got to have something to motivate you.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:56.820]   And I think that's the love of sin, and I think it's the desire to avoid existential
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:04.180]   and eternal consequences for your sin, and have to face a God who is the judge. If you
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.600]   ever read - you can get a little bit of this if you read The Intellectuals by Paul Johnson,
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.200]   where he looks at all the intellectuals, the Renaissance, Enlightenment intellectuals,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.520]   and their lives would make a black mark on a piece of
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.840]   coal. They were the most wretched, immoral, godless, atheistic people looking for a way
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:31.660]   to survive in a universe that had no God, that had no righteous law, that had no consequence
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:38.600]   with regard to what they did in their behavior. So Rousseau is a classic illustration of a
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.320]   wretched human being to the very core.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:47.360]   He was as fallen maybe as a human being could be, and these guys were philosophizing a
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   world without God so they could survive the angst of their own guilt. The only thing that
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:59.260]   would make you as irrational as to say nobody times nothing equals everything was something
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:06.260]   more compelling than reality. And you get into a terrible philosophical dishonesty at
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:12.460]   that point in which everything becomes a way to escape any accountability before a holy
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.200]   God with your sin.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.320]   I think that word science, and I only mention it very briefly, but it's very, very important.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.760]   When I debated Bill 9 in 2014 at the Creation Museum, and the first thing I did when I got
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.680]   up, because he was saying it's science versus the Bible, and the first thing I did was I
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.980]   said we need to understand our terms and define our terms. And what does the word science
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.040]   really mean? The word science means knowledge, and there's different ways of gaining knowledge.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.040]   But I also went on to talk about the fact that, you know, there's a lot of things that
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.500]   we can do. And I mentioned in the talk before, historical science, beliefs about the past,
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.920]   is very different to using your five senses in the present. But all scientists have the
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:02.120]   same evidence. The evidence is always the same. The evidence is no different. You interpret
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:08.340]   the evidence in a particular way, and your bias very much determines that. You know,
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.480]   the Scripture makes it clear, you're either for Christ or against. You walk in light or
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.880]   darkness. There's no neutrality. That's what you were saying before. There's no neutral
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.240]   belief. I think for much of the church, a lot of people misunderstand science, and they
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.100]   misunderstand that people can be neutral. They've got this idea scientists can be neutral.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.640]   I think it's one of the reasons why we even allow the Freedom From Religion Foundation,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:40.060]   that group of atheists from Wisconsin, and getting their way and bullying schools and
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:46.720]   so on, because we've got this idea, oh, wait a minute, if you have crosses and nativity scenes,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.280]   that's Christian, that's religion, you get rid of crosses and nativity scenes and the
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.560]   Bible and prayer out of schools, now it's neutral. But it's not neutral. Now it's anti-God.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.440]   And that's the whole point. So secular means anti-God. A lot of people think secular means
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.900]   neutral. And I think we've got some fundamental problems with understanding those sorts of
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:15.700]   things, which is why we get so led astray by people who claim to be scientists. And
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.560]   scientists can make mistakes.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.280]   And scientists are fallible. And we shouldn't look on scientists as neutral people, all
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.280]   searching for truth or anything like that, because of the nature of man, just what's
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:30.020]   being said here. Man is against God. Our heart is, we don't want God. So we're against God.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.740]   So we would rather believe that which is wrong than that which is right. They will look for
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.600]   explanations that will go against God because of their very nature.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.280]   Yeah. And one of the things, one of the mantras we've heard over the last two plus years is
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.400]   the science is settled.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:53.000]   And really all that is, is a power play. It is an, everything comes back to authority,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.380]   as Pastor John always says. Everything is a matter of epistemology. How do you know
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.860]   what you know? What are your first principles? What is that set of presuppositions that are
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:09.840]   inviolable? And when you throw out the only viable set of presuppositions that can give
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.240]   you a consistent worldview, namely God's own word on these things, on life, on reality,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.420]   you have to replace it with something. And when you reject special revelation here, what
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:29.840]   you replace it with is an authoritative group of so-called experts that everybody feels
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.740]   themselves too inadequate to say, "Well, look, trust the experts. What's your doctorate in?
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.960]   Why don't you just pipe down and let the experts speak? Are you, sorry, you as scientists?"
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:46.080]   We've had all of that over the last two and a half years on a huge scale. But, you know,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.120]   science, there's a difference between science and what we now are calling scientism. The
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:58.240]   ism sort of tacked on there to show that it really is a worldview. It's a way of interpreting
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.460]   reality, not just observing reality.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.400]   It's really a worship of man.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.960]   So it's a surrogate religion actually, right?
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:12.140]   Exactly. And what you see is, I don't want to be questioned. Don't bother me with
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.920]   the evidence. The science is settled and you...
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   You're a rube.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.420]   You pipe down. And so what do you get? What is real science? You can observe testable
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:28.200]   and repeatable phenomena and demonstrate, you know, form hypotheses, test them and come
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.740]   to conclusions. Well, you obviously can't do observational science on the age of the
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:40.920]   earth, you know, and so what comes in response to that is, "Oh, just trust us. It can't be
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.760]   that a god has done this, so we will infer millions of years." And so now we're told
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:55.220]   right that the baby in the womb is a baby if the mother wants it and a knot is just
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:00.620]   a clump of cells if the mother doesn't want it. Is that scientific? Is the science settled
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.860]   there? We're told that a man can become a woman and a woman can become a man if they
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:12.960]   feel like it. We just create reality around our opinions and then declare the science
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.600]   is settled. And if you disagree with this, you're just...
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.920]   You're just some sort of troglodyte who doesn't understand education. You need to go educate
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.220]   yourself, right? And I think that's what we saw in the last several years.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.120]   And you know, we've had generations of kids, 85, 90 percent of kids from church homes gone
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:35.840]   through the secular education system and they've been indoctrinated to believe evolution is
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.500]   science, millions of years is science. "Oh, you believe the Bible? That's okay. That's
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.720]   religion. That's sort of a storybook over here. That's religion." And so generations
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.440]   of kids have really been indoctrinated to believe that.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.420]   They've been indoctrinated, "Just trust us. Like you said, we're the experts. We're the
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.840]   scientists. Just trust us." And so the Bible is sort of being relegated to a book of, "It's
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:59.120]   just stories, fairy tales, whatever, religion." And then it's been pitted as religion versus
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:06.220]   science. And even I found many Christian leaders have this sort of idea that we've got to trust
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:10.820]   the scientists. We're religious people. You know, they don't understand it's religion
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.940]   versus religion. That's what it really is.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.280]   One of my points about the...
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:22.300]   ...the changes in scientific consensus just through the COVID crisis is that scientific
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:28.520]   dogma never really is settled, is it? I mean, if you read the history of science, it is a
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:35.900]   constantly changing set of theories and ideas. Is there any scientific dogma that really
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.900]   is settled?
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:45.120]   Well, I would say I think there are some scientists who are more honest than others. The honest
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:54.820]   one is, you don't see in politics. What you get is guys who have been politicized, who
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:01.040]   are in it for the money and the power. That's what we've been subject to. I mean, Anthony
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.160]   Fauci would be a classic illustration of a guy no one should trust.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:14.960]   Ken, would you describe...
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:24.360]   Would you describe what you do as mostly apologetics as opposed to theology? Would
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.200]   you call your ministry an apologetics ministry?
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.080]   Well, we are an apologetics ministry, but we've always been a biblical authority
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   ministry.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   Right.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.780]   What I would say is our ministry is one of biblical authority, but we have specialized
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:44.800]   in a particular type of apologetics because of the attacks on God's Word in the era we
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:51.180]   live in. And so we have developed a lot of tools for people to have to be able to deal
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:56.240]   with those attacks. Those attacks are on the authority of the Word of God. So our ministry
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:03.020]   is a biblical authority ministry. We're an evangelistic ministry that helps people. We
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:11.120]   come alongside the church, alongside of parents to help them in providing tools to them because
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.640]   God's raised up lots of experts that we have in our ministry.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:22.500]   We have some great scientists who love the Lord and they recognize the limitations of
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:30.640]   science. But we produce some great tools because those tools aren't necessarily available everywhere.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.580]   I believe the gods raised us up to provide those specialist tools for today's world.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.940]   And even with the attractions, the Ark and the Creation Museum, my burden for these has
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.480]   always been, how do you reach the people out there? If we can do something that's going
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.900]   to be a good example of how we can do something that's like the quality of Disney or better
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.460]   than Disney. I don't even like comparing ourselves to Disney these days, you know.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.880]   Yeah, these days especially. But Disney was always looked on as quality. But if you do
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.600]   something like that, people tell me even from the church, if you are bold about God's Word,
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.740]   you're overt about God's Word and the Gospel, you're not going to get people to come. They're
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.980]   not going to come to that. We are very bold. We're very overt about what we do and evangelistic.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:14.320]   And you'll see that as you go through the exhibits, presentation of the Gospel. And people come
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:20.680]   here. And you'll get people, 30% of those who come here are non-Christian. And I've
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:27.840]   been here on days I've seen Sikhs, I've seen Buddhists, Catholic nuns, priests, lots of
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:37.360]   Amish Ammanites, even Baptists come here. And Presbyterians occasionally. But you'll
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   see a mix of people here you won't necessarily see in the church. But the idea is bring them
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.160]   in and challenge them.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.040]   And equip them. Let the exhibits do the teaching. Don't hit them on the head. Let the exhibits
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:53.600]   do the teaching. Present them boldly with God's Word and the Gospel. And I find many,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.460]   many people that then take this back to their churches, their area, non-Christians are challenged
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.840]   and so on. And so it's sort of a ministry to proclaim God's Word and the Gospel in a
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.400]   different way to help the church across the world.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:14.000]   You know, Phil, I think it would be good, Mike, to explain to the people the
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.960]   difference between a presuppositional apologetic and a non-presuppositional apologetic and
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   how those relate.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   That's for me?
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Yes.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   That's for you.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.760]   I get to teach apologetics at the Master's Seminary and so that's something
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:33.300]   that I love to do. Presuppositional apologetics simply starts from the presupposition, the
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:39.520]   reality that everybody reasons according to first principles, to foundational presuppositions
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.840]   that form the rest of their understanding of reality.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:50.800]   And so, you know, I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.

[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   I think that's a really good example of how we can help people.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   I think of the scripture, you know, when Jesus talked about the king who trusted resources to his servants and went away and then said, "Do business until I return."
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   We're to do the business of the king until he returns, regardless.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   And for a lot of people today, I've had them say, "Oh, we're in the last days. What's the point of doing things?"
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   People said that to us. I remember people said that to Dr. Henry Morris.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   He shared with me.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   He wrote the book that was co-authored with Dr. Wickham on the Genesis flood.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   And he said, people said to him, "What's the point of doing this because Jesus is going to come soon?"
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   And there's no point trying to challenge people in this area.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   Well, he wrote that book in the early 60s, '61, I think it was published.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   And look what has come out of that and its impact on people.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   And so I think we've got to do the business of the king until he returns.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Regardless of where the culture is at, we've got to faithfully proclaim God's word and the gospel and do what we can.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   And if I can also say this is a four-point sermon.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   That's two points.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   But so I don't think it's biblical because only three-point sermons are biblical, right?
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   So but you know the most asked question we get asked here?
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   The most asked question at the Ark in the Creation Museum.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   Do you know a church in our area that stands on God's word as you do?
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   I don't know one.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   There's a famine in the land, a famine of the preaching of the word of God.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   And the last thing I wanted to say was this.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   I believe today we have a major problem with many of our churches.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   There's a big problem in the church.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   I see a church that by and large, not all of course, but by and large is very lukewarm.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   And I've sort of got a bird's eye view of the church.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   I've spoken in all 50 states.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   I've spoken in hundreds of churches in America, different denominations.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   I've had some interesting experiences.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   But I've done that across the world in many different countries as well for 40 years.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   So you tend to get a bird's eye view of the church.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   Can I give you a bird's eye view of the church in America?
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   Here's what I see by and large.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   I see many churches.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   They're all the same.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   And they all do the same thing.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   They have a praise team out the front.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   I love music, right?
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   We have a piano there, see?
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   We have our own resident artists that sing here at the Ark in Cana actually.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   And I even play with them at times.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   I love music, so don't get me wrong on that.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   In fact, my philosophy of music is, you know, for many churches,
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   I think their philosophy of music is the worst of – well,
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   my philosophy is the best of the old and the best of the new.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   A lot of churches, it's none of the old and the worst of the new is what I see.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   So –
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   What I find is they have this praise team out the front.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   And, you know, you stand up for an hour and sing the five songs, four words each,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.800]   you know, a hundred times each, or whatever it is.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.800]   And if you actually judge the theology against God's word,
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   in a lot of instances, you would not sing those songs.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   But they're very performance-oriented.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   So it's more entertainment, flashing lights.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   A lot of the songs you can't sing.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   They're not congregational songs.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.800]   You can't sing them as a congregation.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.800]   They're more performance-oriented.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   And then there's shallow teaching.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   The Bible's hardly mentioned.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   A lot of interesting stories at times.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:04.800]   And they think that that's going to get the people in in big numbers
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   and keep the people – have a look.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:07.800]   We're losing the younger generations.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   It's not working.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   Because they're not dealing with what they should be doing,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   is teaching God's word faithfully, equipping them,
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.800]   and standing uncompromisingly on God's word.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.800]   And so much of the church is not doing that.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   So they become more entertainment.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   They're more like the culture.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   They let the culture invade the church.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   And so they're very lukewarm.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   And so therefore they're not impacting the culture like they should.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   They're not impacting hearts and minds like they should.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   And I think in a lot of these big churches,
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   a lot of people there, they think they're Christian, like Newsome,
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   but they have no idea what Christianity is.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   No understanding.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.800]   Yeah, you know, a couple of things about that.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.800]   Amen to everything you just said.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.800]   In our neighborhood, somebody plants a new church about once a month,
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   and they'll create a flyer or put a little card on your door,
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   and they always say, "This is not like any other church you've ever been to."
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   And I always think, "It's exactly like every church I've ever been to."
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   Music becomes the center and the focus, not the teaching of the word.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   That's what I've seen.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   And the other thing is,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   I echo what you say.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   At Grace To You,
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   the most commonly asked question we get is from people who are looking for a church
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   that's faithful to the Word of God,
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   and they can't find one in their area.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   Mike, let me ask you a slightly different question in the same vein.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   Some of you will have read the statement that Grace Church put out
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   when we resumed worship after a brief hiatus with the COVID thing.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   Mike was the one who drafted that.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   It's called, "Christ, Not Caesar, Is the Head of the Church."
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   Talk a bit about that and how that plays into the increased pressure on churches
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   to tailor our message to the culture and all of that.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   Just talk about that article.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   Sure.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.800]   And I won't let you get away.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.800]   I mean, Phil and I did a…you had a pretty big hand in that as well.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.800]   You drafted it.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   I edited it.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   You published it.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.800]   Okay.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   So, he's the genius behind it.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.800]   No.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:24.800]   I think the big thing there was, you know, we were forced into a situation that many
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   of us were not…never had to be forced into, and that is, you know, what do you do when,
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   you know, the government tells you you literally can't be the church?
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.800]   I mean, to be the church is to gather.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.800]   Church means assembly.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   And so, there's no such thing as a non-assembling assembly.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   And a lot of people, you know, just kind of thought through it as, "Look, Romans 13 says
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   you obey the government.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.800]   You obey the authorities unless they're telling you to sin, unless they're telling you to
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   do something God forbids, or they're telling you not to do something God commands, well,
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   then you obey."
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   And, of course, gathering is something that God commands, and so it moves it into that
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   realm.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   But even deeper than that, one of the things that, you know, we kind of all began to think,
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   you know, we kind of all began to dig deeper into was, you know, every person is to be
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   in subjection to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God,
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   and those which exist are established by God.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.800]   Therefore, whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and they who have opposed
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   And so, a lot of critics ask, you know, how can you just say no that way?
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   And, of course, we recognize that there are exceptions to that, and we go to Acts chapter
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.800]   4, and we see the prohibition to speak in Christ's name, and the apostles disregard
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   that.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   We go to Acts 5, and we see the same: "We must obey God rather than men."
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   But we also go to places like Acts 16, where Paul's in jail in Philippi, and he's been
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   mistreated because he's a citizen of Rome, and when the authorities find out about it,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.800]   they say, "Oh, you know, we messed up here.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   Go get him out."
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   And they send the magistrate, or the magistrates send the officers, and the officers say, "Okay,
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   time for you to go and go in peace."
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   And Paul says, "No, indeed."
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   What sin would Paul have been committing had he left the jail at that very time like the
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   authorities told him to?
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   He wouldn't have been committing any sin.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:30.800]   And so, like there is an exception for doing what God forbids or not doing what God commands,
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   there's also an exception in the sense that there is unlawful authority.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.800]   There is authority that is attempted...being attempted.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.800]   There is authority that is being attempted to be exercised that is actually illegitimate.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   There is no authority except which is from God, but that doesn't mean that anybody can
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   say to do anything, and therefore I'm from God.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   If I flag a car down here on the highway and I say, "Sorry, sir, you've been speeding.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   You need to pay your fine.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   That'll be $150.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   You can make your check payable to Mike Riccardi," right, just because I set myself up, put a
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.800]   badge on myself and say I'm an authority doesn't mean that that authority is from God, because
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.800]   no authority is established except by God.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.800]   It means that people can attempt to exert undue, unlawful authority.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   And so you say, "Okay, well, what's unlawful?
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   What's undue?"
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   And you go further on in Romans 13, and you see the kinds of things that Paul is saying you
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   ought to render to the government.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   Verse 7, right, "Render to all what is due them tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.800]   custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor."
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:43.800]   And even that phrase, "Render to whom what is due," recalls Matthew 22:21 where Jesus
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.800]   Himself says, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   are God's."
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.800]   And what He's telling us there is that there are spheres of authority.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   There is the ecclesiastical sphere, the church sphere, the spiritual sphere, that's the things
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.800]   that are God's, and then there's the civil sphere, the governmental sphere.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   And so, in the government, when Caesar attempts to exercise authority outside of his sphere,
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   outside of the authority given to him by God to exert authority in civil matters, and he
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   usurps and inserts himself into ecclesiastical matters, what he is doing as the head of the
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   state is intending or attempting to become the head of the church, and that is unlawful
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   authority.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   And so, what we were concerned to establish or reaffirm is that we are not going to submit
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   to an authority that is illegitimate.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   We're going to see that Christ has His headship through and through.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800]   Amen.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   John, last question.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.800]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.800]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   Last question for you.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   I think someday when the definitive John MacArthur biography is written, a major chapter in that
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   book will chronicle your leadership at Grace Church during the COVID crisis.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   You talked about this a bit last night.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   Just give us a summary.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:29.800]   What did you learn and what did Grace Church gain from all of the conflict that surrounded
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   us during the COVID crisis?
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:39.800]   Well, I don't want to drag it out, but initially we were basically told what everybody was
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   told: "Stay home.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   Can't go anywhere.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   Can't meet as a church because this plague has arrived, and people are going to die."
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   And our initial reaction was, "Well, we don't want to kill anybody, so okay, we'll do live
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   stream."
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   And then we went Sunday and I preached to an empty church.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   And a few weeks went by and it became apparent to me and to pretty much a lot of us that
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   they were lying about the death threat.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   And when we began to see in California, for example, the statistics were somewhere around
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   99 percent survival, we knew we weren't going to kill people.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   So without making a public announcement, we just said, "If you want to come to church,
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   come to church."
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   There were people who were afraid.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.800]   They said, "Well, you can meet outside."
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   So we let people meet outside if they were comfortable.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   We put up a tent with the sides open if they felt better there.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.800]   We didn't make any restrictions.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.800]   We didn't say, "Don't wear a mask.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.800]   Wear a mask.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   Distance.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   Don't distance."
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   We didn't say anything about it.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   We said, "We'll be fine."
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   We said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   We said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   We said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   We said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   I said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   We said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.800]   They said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   I said, "We're going to church."
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:41.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800]   I said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.800]   They said, "Well, we're going to church."
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.880]   They made false accusations about us and eventually had to put on the Health Department
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:26.400]   website there is no outbreak of COVID at Grace Community Church.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:33.500]   We had 5,000 people milling around every Sunday with no regard for any distancing, and we
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.560]   never had an outbreak of COVID.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.740]   There were so many people there, it was impossible to practice any kind of social distancing.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.620]   Well, of course.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.300]   But the point was God designed us to share our germs.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:52.540]   And Grace Church became the safest place to be because everybody had natural immunity.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.800]   And people started coming from everywhere and everywhere.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.140]   And I think, you know, you guys have followed it.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:02.680]   We probably have 85 to 100 people joined our church every month for the last two years.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.420]   This just exploded.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.640]   And they found that this was a church that was open, and then they found that this was
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   a church like no other church.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.800]   And I remember the Sunday which was most memorable.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.560]   It was the Sunday early on when we said, "We want to bring the kids back.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.660]   There's nothing to be afraid of."
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:26.680]   And to show you how fearless the parents were, a thousand elementary kids came on that Sunday
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   to our church.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.720]   We had lollipops this big.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.520]   We had balloons all over the campus.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.320]   And they've been there ever since.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:41.040]   And in the middle of all that, we had a vacation Bible school with 1,300 little kids for a
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040]   week.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.300]   And we continued.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.480]   We continued to be the church, and we continued to live in the reality that we were being
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.920]   lied to.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:57.640]   We were being lied to, and our people - because we weren't afraid, they weren't afraid.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.080]   And the document that Mike and Phil worked on and our elders affirmed was very important
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.100]   in establishing a theological foundation of that.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:11.060]   And then it became apparent to everybody that this was a healthy place to be, and so we
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.800]   had the most explosive growth in the history of church.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.360]   And we had the most explosive growth in the history of Grace Community Church.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.080]   And interviewing that many people every month for new membership is really a formidable
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.480]   thing, and especially when they're not coming from the normal churches that come to our
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.480]   church.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.920]   They're coming from Lutheran churches and Episcopal churches and who knows whatever
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920]   and whatever.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.740]   So we're getting people.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.820]   Normally our church grows - people get converted to Christ through the influence of our people,
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.480]   or they come from another Bible-teaching church to ours.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.420]   But now all of a sudden, we're getting all of them.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.820]   We're getting all these people from any kind of church.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:52.700]   And we had a marvelous time baptizing lots and lots of people and bringing them into
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.140]   membership.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:08:01.220]   And Grace became the very island of sanity in the midst of the chaos of the city of Los
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.220]   Angeles.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:07.340]   And we had 12 court hearings established when they were going to try to shut us down.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:12.240]   The judge in our case for each of those was a man married to a man.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.940]   So he was not favorable to us, obviously.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:22.660]   But he happened to be a constitutionalist, and he would never let the city shut us down,
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:26.960]   because he said, "Until you get past the First Amendment, you can't litigate this particular
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   case."
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.460]   We got tired of the constant hearings that were postponed.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:39.200]   So to end the little tale, our attorneys said we're going to depose the health officials
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.360]   in a legal deposition.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:40.960]   The three top health officials in Los Angeles.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.240]   And the state of Los Angeles is going to be deposed.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:41.360]   The state of Los Angeles is going to be deposed.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:41.880]   And the state of Los Angeles is going to be deposed.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.040]   And the state of Los Angeles is going to be deposed.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.320]   Angeles.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.720]   We announced to them that we were going to depose them, and in 24 hours they removed
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:57.300]   all contempt of court, all fines, all fees and everything, because the one thing they
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.080]   feared most was the truth.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:08.480]   And the truth was 99 percent of the people survived this, and it was really an illness
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.340]   that took a toll on old people who had complications or comorbidities.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.780]   So when we said that, they dropped all charges.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:23.100]   They tried to take away our parking lot, and the Jewish synagogue down the block said,
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.360]   "You can use our parking lot."
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.940]   So we're still parking in the Jewish synagogue on Sunday.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:36.060]   So the Lord just was so faithful, and I think we gave courage to other churches to take
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.460]   a stand.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:42.360]   Running up - there are always trials you have, but running up against the state and
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.460]   government, city government, county government, state of California, the hostility of the
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:51.720]   governor and all that, you really are in the Lord's hands.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.700]   And so it was a great opportunity to see the hand of God, and we saw that.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:01.340]   Yeah, you seemed energized by the whole episode.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.080]   Not discouraged, but energized.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   I appreciated that.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.080]   Thank you.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.440]   Well, the giving in our church just went over the top.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.800]   People love the church.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.800]   They came.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.960]   They've given so generously because we're being the church.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.320]   They feel safe.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.400]   They feel cared for.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:25.060]   They feel loved, and they feel like they're being served by the pastors.
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.060]   Well, thank you for your boldness and example.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.060]   All of us appreciate it.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.960]   Yeah, I mean, I was going to say a personal word that way.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.420]   To be there that whole time and really have a front-row seat to all of us, it's a great
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.440]   thing.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.440]   I mean, I think that's what it's all about.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   I think that's what it's all about.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   I think that's what it's all about.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440]   I think that's what it's all about.

[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   I think that's what it's all about.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.440]   I think that's what it's all about.
