[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.700]   True discipleship is how you respond to the truth of the Word of God, right?
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.720]   You love the Word, you feed on the Word, you live out the Word.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.020]   It's the truth of the Gospel, the truth of the Word of God that sets you free from the slavery to sin.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.720]   The only truth that's going to liberate your soul and liberate you freely from sin forever
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.400]   is the truth of the Gospel.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.960]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the Gospel?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.420]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.420]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.860]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.860]   Well, as we all know, freedom has always been something highly valued in our society,
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.280]   at least up until now.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.480]   Through the last couple of centuries, freedom seemed to be at the top of the list of things
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.540]   that folks wanted to maintain in our culture and our society.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.920]   And over the years, there has been a phrase that has been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   It's been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   It's been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.980]   It's been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.040]   It's been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.080]   It's been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.140]   It's been used with regard to the fact that we are not free.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.480]   It's been used with regard to freedom.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.680]   It's the phrase, the truth shall make you free, or the truth shall set you free.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.940]   It's interesting to know how many ways that phrase has been used.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.500]   But when we talk about the truth shall make you free, psychology fails.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.940]   Psychology fails.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.720]   You're just playing mind games with yourself.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.720]   Philosophy fails because the truth is not in you.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.120]   There's no value in being free.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.080]   There's no value in being cynical and believing that the truth doesn't exist because no objective,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.680]   absolute truth exists.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.660]   The educational system and the universities fail.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.160]   Science fails because it gets corrupted.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.760]   And the government, when the government fails and the government does fail, then the tale
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.880]   is told.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.340]   Because they're in charge.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.660]   So whatever it means, the truth shall make you free, has nothing to do with any of these
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.200]   things because they're all corrupted.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.480]   We're talking about something different.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.360]   So open your Bible to John 8.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.260]   So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word,
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.640]   then you are truly disciples of Mine.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.900]   And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.760]   There's that statement.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.720]   They answered Him, "We're Abraham's descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.300]   How is it that you say you will become free?"
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.340]   Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.640]   of sin.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   The slave does not remain in the house forever.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.280]   The son does remain forever.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.240]   So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.760]   What a great statement.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.400]   The truth shall make you free.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.640]   What truth and what freedom?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.940]   That is the question.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.200]   That is the question.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.800]   As we think about answering that question.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   I'm going to read a passage from the Old Testament.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.760]   We go back to verse 31 and how it all came up.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.100]   There were some Jews, verse 30 says, who came to believe in Jesus.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.760]   That's right.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.260]   They came to believe in Jesus.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.120]   Who were they?
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:17.520]   Well, back in verse 22 it says they were Jews, but if you keep going back to verse 13, they
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   were Pharisees.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:30.060]   So Jesus is having a conversation with Pharisees, the Jewish leaders.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:39.260]   And some of them, in fact many, had come to believe in Him.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.640]   That brings into question how legitimate their belief was.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.760]   We've seen that before in the gospel of John.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.820]   Back in chapter 2, verse 23, when Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast,
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.000]   many believed in His name, observing His signs, which He was doing.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.960]   But Jesus on His part was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.900]   And because He didn't need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.900]   in man.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.760]   And what He knew was that whatever their believing was, it wasn't sufficient to save them.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Amen.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   They believed in His name, seeing the signs.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.060]   He didn't commit Himself to them, because that belief was superficial.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.620]   We saw this again in chapter 6, verse 60.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.800]   Many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a difficult statement.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   Who can listen to it?"
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.480]   In verse 61, "Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled, said, 'I am the Lord of the nations,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   and I will not give up my life to you.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   I will not give up my life to you.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   I will not give up my life to you.'
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   Jesus grumbled at this, said to them, 'Does this cause you to stumble?
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.980]   What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.360]   It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.'"
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.660]   In other words, you have a superficial view.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.540]   What if you saw the full glory?
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.160]   Then He says in verse 65, "No one can come to Me unless it's granted him from the Father."
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.200]   Verse 66, "As a result of this, many of His disciples withdrew.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.020]   They were not walking with Him anymore."
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.500]   And Jesus said to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.840]   And Simon Peter said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.660]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.620]   We have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God."
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.780]   And then Jesus responded by identifying Judas, "Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve,
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.240]   and one of you is a devil?"
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.920]   Now He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he was one of the devils.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.780]   He was one of the twelve and was going to betray Him.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.600]   So we see belief that is not saving belief in chapter 2.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.980]   We see discipleship that is not genuine in chapter 6.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.820]   So the question comes then with regard, verse 30, to those who believed in Him, "What was
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.960]   the nature of this believing?"
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.280]   What was the nature of it?
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.640]   Was it the real thing, or was it just more of this same fascination with Jesus and with
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.000]   His teaching and with His miracles?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.620]   Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, then you
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.160]   are truly disciples of Mine."
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.520]   This jumps out of this text.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:46.360]   Aleithos mathētes , genuine disciples, real, authentic, true disciples are identified
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:53.100]   because they continue in My word.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.080]   They continue in My word.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.100]   So let me just give you two points.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.260]   Point number one, the benchmark of true discipleship, perseverance in truth.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.920]   The benchmark of true discipleship, perseverance in truth.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.660]   This is not something that's isolated to the teaching of Jesus.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.080]   Listen to the words of James.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:24.940]   James 2:17, "Even so, faith, if it has no works, is dead."
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:31.860]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.980]   That's how the chapter ends.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:44.300]   You could say you believe, but if it doesn't show up in persevering in the truth, persevering
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.800]   in the truth.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   "Continuing in My word."
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.260]   In the Great Commission, Matthew 28, Jesus said, "When you go to make disciples, teach
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:03.360]   them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you."
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.540]   Coming to Christ is not simply establishing that you believe in Him.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.040]   It is submitting to Him in obedience.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.520]   It is saying, "Jesus is Lord, and I am His slave."
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.680]   This is a major theme for the writers of the New Testament.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.420]   We don't have time to go through all of the passages.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.980]   Matthew records this.
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.520]   Mark records it.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   Luke records it.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.120]   John records it, because it was an essential part of the ministry of our Lord Jesus.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.020]   First John writes a whole epistle on this issue of true salvation as opposed to false
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.020]   salvation.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.240]   But let me just kind of sum it up.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.440]   I'm going to read some of those words of the book of Hebrews, because in the book of
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:58.260]   Hebrews there is a summation statement that I think is important.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.700]   It's in Hebrews 12:14.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.800]   It says, "Pursue peace with all men," and listen, "and the sanctification without which
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.420]   no one will see the Lord."
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.960]   Did you see that?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.640]   Because sanctification, and that is a life separated from sin, you'll never see the Lord.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   Next verse, "See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God."
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.660]   Don't come up short because you believed in Christ, but you never committed your life
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.840]   to Him.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.680]   Or James says in James, chapter 1, "Don't be just a hearer, but a - " what?
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   " - a doer of the Word, so that you're not deceived."
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.380]   Where there's no perseverance in the truth, that means loving the truth and living the
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.540]   truth, there is no salvation.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:00.960]   So the benchmark of enduring, saving faith is continuing in the Word.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   It is sanctification.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.760]   It is the work of the Word to separate the believer from sin.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.400]   It is a faith that works, and it works to sanctify a true believer.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   It is the work of the Word to create a true believer.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.000]   works so that no one may boast."
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.340]   But verse 10, "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.480]   God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.700]   So the benchmark, then, of true discipleship is how you respond to the truth of the Word
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.300]   of God, right?
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.100]   Do you love the Word?
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.900]   Do you feed on the Word?
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.920]   Do you live out the Word?
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.140]   Is it your most precious possession?
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:11.960]   Psalm 19, "Sweeter than honey, more precious than gold."
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.240]   That's the truth.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.160]   That's the truth that sets you free.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.280]   When you come to the Word of God and you believe the Word of God, you're set free.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.720]   The truth, that truth, that truth of the Word of God, including the gospel in all its fullness,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:36.820]   that the gospel that relates to justification as well as sanctification as well as glorification,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.960]   when you embrace that and persevere in those truths and don't defect from those things,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.560]   that's the benchmark of being a true disciple.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.040]   That's what brings you freedom.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.600]   What do you mean by freedom?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.040]   What are we talking about?
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.080]   What freedom?
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:59.520]   Go to verse 32, "You will know the truth, the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.120]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.280]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.920]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God."
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   You will know the truth as revealed in the Word of God.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:27.680]   They had been ruled by many nations, but they said, "We've never been enslaved to anyone."
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.160]   And Jesus said, "Yeah, you have slavery."
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.420]   Verse 34, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin."
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:41.740]   You're a slave of sin; you're a slave of sin.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.500]   That's your problem.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.900]   What is freedom then?
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.960]   Freedom from the slavery to what?
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.340]   Sin.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.180]   It's the truth of the gospel, the truth of the Word of God that sets you free from the
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.440]   slavery to sin.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:02.340]   The only truth that's going to liberate your soul and liberate you freely from sin forever
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.740]   is the truth of the gospel.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.400]   The world, 2 Timothy 3:7, is ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.980]   the truth.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.580]   This is humanity's futile effort.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.920]   They're all defiant fishermen.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.760]   They've got their line in an empty tub.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.980]   They're all defiant.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.440]   The truth, says Ephesians 4:21, is in Jesus.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.260]   Not only does the Bible say the truth is in Jesus, the Bible says in John 14:6, "Jesus
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.700]   is the truth."
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.920]   John 1:14, "He's full of grace and truth.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.980]   He's the teacher of truth," John 16.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.620]   Those who believe in Him.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:53.760]   "And His Word are set free from sin."
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.180]   Truth will make you free.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:04.400]   The cynicism of the world was on the lips of Pilate in John 18.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.580]   Pilate said to Jesus, "So you're a king."
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.060]   Jesus answered, "You say correctly that I am a king.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.680]   For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.480]   truth."
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.440]   "Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.520]   Pilate says, "What is truth?"
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.860]   If you're a cynic about truth, you're doomed.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.420]   "Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.700]   The only way you'll ever know the truth that sets you free from sin and death and hell
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:46.340]   is to know the truth which is in Jesus, which is the Lord Jesus.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.220]   He is the truth.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.580]   His Word is the truth.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.800]   "Sanctify them by Thy truth," John 17:17.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.300]   Thy Word is truth.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.200]   The truth makes you free from slavery to sin.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.720]   The Jews didn't want to admit that.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.820]   Verse 33, "We've never been enslaved to anyone.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.180]   How is it you say you will become free?"
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."

[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."

[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."

[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   "We've never been a slave to anyone."
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   Now do you understand that?
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:06.060]   Indeed, "antos," really free, certainly free, truly free, total freedom from sin, total
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:18.980]   freedom therefore from deception, from oppression, depression, punishment, penalty, even the
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.260]   presence of sin.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.200]   Forever free from all sin.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.560]   Forever free from all sin.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:34.880]   To the degree that the apostle Paul says in Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.280]   to those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:45.140]   It's that great truth that caused Charles Wesley to write, "And can it be that I should
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.440]   gain an interest in the Savior's blood?"
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.260]   That great hymn, which is a celebration of being delivered from sin.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.460]   That great hymn, which is a celebration of being delivered from bondage to sin.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.780]   So who is a true disciple?
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.180]   Who is a genuine follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.960]   The one who perseveres in the truth, endures through blessing and suffering.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.940]   The one who is faithful and obedient.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.140]   That soul is a son and not a slave.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:20.620]   He has been set free from sin's bondage to the freedom for which Christ has made us.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   He has made us free.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.620]   Again, I liked things in this country the way they used to be.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:36.920]   I don't know what the Lord has for us in the future, but I do know this: it's been an incredible
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.040]   adventure already, hasn't it?
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.460]   I don't know that in the years of the time we've been together at Grace Church we've
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.800]   ever had a more wonderful time than the past 18 months.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.460]   The hardest of times and the best of times, and that's often the way it is.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.500]   That's why James said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.500]   He said, "Count it all down."
