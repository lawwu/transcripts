[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 191.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.440]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ by myself.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.680]   Jesse has abandoned me this week for a no good reason.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.240]   The lacrosse team he helps coach is on the road.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   They're planning a tournament.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.040]   I've told Jesse one thing, I've told him this a thousand times, the youth of this country
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.280]   are a distraction that get in the way of what matters, which is middle-aged men talking
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280]   about productivity.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.720]   I don't know when that lesson is going to sink in.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.720]   Now, I warned everyone, I warned everyone last time Jesse was gone that if he was gone
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.840]   again, I was going to create a Jesse Scarecrow and put him, put that in his chair so that
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.160]   we could keep going in our old style.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.680]   I have followed through on that threat.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.960]   Say hi to everyone, Jesse Scarecrow.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.840]   Hi Cal, it's me, me Jesse.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   Well Jesse, good to see you dressed up for the episode today.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200]   What's on your mind?
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:35.520]   Well I just wanted to say, compared to you, Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa are garbage
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520]   people.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.040]   Oh Jesse, that is, I think that's too extreme.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.240]   I try to do what I can, but you know, I'm not that great.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   Nope, nope, nope.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   Here's the thing, I am in my forties, you are only in your thirties, so I am clearly
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240]   much older than you.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.080]   So I speak from wisdom when I, when I would say they are garbage people compared to you
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.360]   because you give advice that's good about time management.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.440]   Well Jesse, I think we're going too far here.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   No, no.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.080]   And I also want to say to Brandon Sanderson, if Cal says you wrote "Name of the Wind,"
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.800]   and that's what you wrote, and I don't want to hear anything else about it.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.880]   All right, well I appreciate that Jesse.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.100]   Now for those of you who are listening and not watching the YouTube feed and therefore
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.320]   are missing these beautiful shots of Jesse Scarecrow, good for you.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Good for you.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   Do not watch it.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   This is nonsense.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   This is shenanigans.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   All right, I'm here by myself.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.800]   I have about a 50% chance of successfully recording this video properly.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.360]   I keep looking to the side that YouTube viewers will notice because I keep checking to see
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.920]   if everything's working.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.520]   I mean, there's a 50% chance that I will fail to record this episode properly.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.400]   There's a 30% chance that there will be like a 20 minute period in which it's just showing
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.240]   Jesse Scarecrow because I forgot to change the camera.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   So that's what we're dealing with today, but I'll do my best.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.480]   I want to try something different.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.400]   Why not?
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000]   I have a good segment, deep dive style segment.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.560]   A cow reacts to the new segment where I'm going to react to John Heights, new article
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.360]   about social media, undermining democracy.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   But I figured why don't we try something different?
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   Dave Ramsey style.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.040]   I'm going to jump straight into the questions.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.560]   We'll get to the segment in a little bit.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.120]   So let's just get started rock and rolling with some questions.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.640]   We'll get to the longer segment later.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.040]   All right.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.240]   Well, the honor of asking the first question in today's episode goes to Steve.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.520]   Steve asks, how do I stick with just one organization system?
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.800]   How can I stick to a system, a paper digital?
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.360]   I go through different seasons where I'm into either digital organization or working with
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.480]   paper and pen.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.160]   What's been working generally is time blocking in a notebook, keeping appointments on a calendar,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160]   but I would like to somehow settle.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.480]   So I'm not expending so much effort on redoing my system.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.160]   Steve, good question.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.840]   Here's what I want you to keep in mind.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   Going from no organizational system to some sort of organizational system that you've
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.680]   thought about, you know, maybe it's built off of the principles I write about, is a
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   big win.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.120]   Now that will make a big difference in your life.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.720]   On the other hand, going from an organizational system, a smart organizational system to a
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.800]   different smart organizational system that you've optimized or tweaked or changed is
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.080]   going to have a small impact on the quality and quantity of what you are able to produce.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.000]   Now there is pleasure, of course, in coming up with new systems that is just isolated
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.840]   from the actual impact of the system.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.120]   If you're like me, and I think you are, it feels good to think about the different ways
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.600]   the pieces of your new system are going to hook together.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.440]   This notebook with this pen, and I'm going to hook it into a remarkable tablet.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.840]   And then that remarkable tablet is going to be FedEx to a sky writer who's going to put
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.080]   my most important task of the day into the sky with smoke.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.680]   It feels good to see all the pieces of the new system, all the pieces of the new system
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.800]   hooked together, but it's not going to make a big difference.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.160]   And so I think you were right to be worried that if you are continually updating your
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.200]   system, you're actually getting in the way of getting the work done that that system
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.240]   is supposed to help.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   So I want to break you out of that cycle.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.960]   I'm going to give you a bare bones vanilla, but will work just fine combination of tools
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.240]   to implement my system.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.880]   And I'm going to ask for you to use it for six months without changing it.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.480]   All right.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.560]   So here's the bare bones version of my system I want you to use.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   Digital calendar.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.140]   All right.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.280]   So appointments can go on your calendar.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.440]   Paper time blocking.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.040]   You've been using a paper notebook.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.280]   That's fine.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.440]   You can use my time block planner at timeblockplanner.com to find out more about that.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.560]   But a notebook you can bring with you for time blocking each day.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.480]   Tasks and weekly plans, whatever system you want.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.000]   So you can use Trello, you can use an online to do list.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.480]   You can use a notebook if you want.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.140]   I don't care.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.140]   Weekly plans.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.480]   Just use a text file or a Google doc.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.520]   Do the same for quarterly plans.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   All right.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.360]   So digital calendar, paper time blocking, weekly, quarterly plans, you know, whatever,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.080]   Google docs, text files, and whatever task management system you want.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   I don't really care, but you're going to stick with what you choose for six months.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.480]   Again, for those who don't know my system, go to the core ideas video on time management
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.220]   at the YouTube page, youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.840]   We avoid this episode so you can avoid seeing the terrifying Jesse Scarecrow.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.520]   What do you mean terrifying?
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   I'm not terrifying.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.400]   Come on, Jesse Scarecrow.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.640]   We're upsetting our viewing audience.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.520]   Steve, so you have that system, use it for six months.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.200]   We have that urge, like I want to fiddle with the system.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.740]   Put that urge into creating something new.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.440]   Put that urge into making the pieces of an idea fit together, a new business strategy
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.280]   fitted together, a new high quality leisure activity that requires complex fiddling.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.540]   You're building things, you're making things.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.580]   Find another outlet for that urge to get the pleasure that comes from pieces clicking together.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.600]   And then after six months, if you want to change your system again, go ahead.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.260]   But here's what I think you're going to find.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.000]   Six months of not changing your system.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.440]   I feel insecure that it's good enough because I told you it is.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   That's fine.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   It'll be fine.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.340]   There's not some major benefit you're going to get compared to that vanilla system I just
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.380]   gave you.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.460]   After six months, you're probably going to say, you know what?
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.460]   I found other outlets for that energy.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.700]   I have more interesting and important things to focus my energy on than fixing my system.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.500]   Right now it's a hobby of yours.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.160]   Find another hobby so that you can actually focus your energy when you're working on actually
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.140]   working and not trying to get these systems to function correctly.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.940]   All right.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:14.380]   So we got another question here.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.040]   This one, I'm clicking.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.860]   This is there we go.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.360]   This is scintillating, by the way, for the viewing audience and the listening audience.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   These moments of silence.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.320]   I'm actually clicking.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.080]   I'm adjusting our recording software.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   Jesse does all this normally.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.360]   So you got to you got to give me some rope.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.600]   Why can't I do it now?
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.560]   Scarecrow, Jesse, you have no arms.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.260]   So I have to do this.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.640]   And so sometimes I have to go and click and change things because I'm not great at doing
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   this on my own anymore.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.520]   And so everyone will have to bear with me, but we're making progress.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.280]   So let's move on now to our next question.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.720]   It comes from Dan.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:09:03.040]   Dan asks, how do I maintain a routine in a job that has wildly changing demands?
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.400]   So he goes on to say, I'm a professional landscape photographer and my job consists of periods
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.480]   of admin work from home mixed with multiple national international trips around the world,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.320]   staying at a home for periods from two weeks to one to two months.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.840]   Deep work and deep life are very important for my job and health.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.680]   And I try to follow all the principles that you show us in your books and podcasts.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.840]   However, when I get home after every trip, it takes me a long time until I'm back on
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   track.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.420]   I do yearly, quarterly, monthly and weekly plans.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.420]   But even so, I'm not consistent.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.480]   And it takes me at least two weeks until I'm fully immersed again.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.520]   Two quick points, Dan, before we get into the meat of it.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.120]   Number one, what goes on in landscape photography?
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.240]   Two months international trips for landscape photography?
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.460]   I have to say, I really do not understand what landscape photography means, but it sounds
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:05.080]   like it is arguably a much cooler job than I imagined, or more likely you are clearly
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.840]   a highly trained international spy and assassin and this is your cover.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:18.640]   So you're just telling your friends and family, yeah, I have to go to Yemen for two months
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.720]   to do landscape photography.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:30.040]   Yeah, well, I need that tuxedo and those two guns and the watch with the garrote wire that
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.360]   pulls out of it because of the demands of landscape photography.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.980]   So clearly you're a spy, but it's a good question to ask.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.160]   The other point I want to make before I get into it though, is yearly, quarterly, monthly,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.840]   weekly a little excessive.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.360]   I don't usually recommend doing monthly.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.860]   If you're doing quarterly, I think daily, weekly, quarterly is good.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.360]   So you're doing a lot of planning.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.320]   But again, as an international spy assassin using landscape photography as your cover,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.920]   maybe your life is more complicated.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:08.480]   All right, let's get to your solution here though, your solution here, which is your
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.200]   job has a feature that is good that I like, that I want more people to have in their jobs.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.280]   And when you recognize this feature, it's going to take off a lot of the stress you
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.360]   feel about managing your work.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   And that feature is seasonality.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.760]   Now, seasonality to me, when I talk about seasonality in work, and I think I get into
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.480]   this, for example, in my video on slow productivity.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:39.120]   So the core idea is slow productivity video on the YouTube channel is it's where you have
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:47.280]   different seasons of your work year and different seasons feel different and are treated differently.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.000]   Now, as a professor, for example, my job is naturally seasonal.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.040]   Okay.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.240]   So there are, for example, low intensity periods like the summer.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.960]   I mean, in the summer, I'm on 10 months salary.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.440]   In the summer, I pay my own salary.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.160]   As I've mentioned before, most R1 university professors are going to take a summer salary
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.600]   from grants, which is what I did when I was leading up to tenure.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.440]   And you're just doing research in the summer.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.240]   Now as a tenured professor and writer, I pay my own salary in the summer.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.960]   So like I do, I'm kind of free from Georgetown in the summer.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.320]   Now, compare that to like last month at the height of the spring semester, I'm co-chairing
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   a cluster hire.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.040]   I'm on another hiring committee, incredibly intense.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.840]   It's a completely different season.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.960]   You know, I think this is good.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.240]   I think it's highly artificial, this idea that your work should be at exactly the same
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.400]   level of intensity and load all year round, with the exception of weekends, two weeks
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.440]   of vacation.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   That's not very natural.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   That's not the way we evolved.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.200]   We evolved to have heavier periods and lighter periods.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.080]   There's the fall when we're harvesting, and the summer where, and the winter where the
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   fields are fallow.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.280]   I mean, this is what we're used to.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.560]   And I think we should have more of that back.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.760]   So you have a seasonal job.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.840]   And your job in particular has three seasons, which show up a lot in seasonal jobs.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.080]   So I'm going to give them names.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.200]   Season one, the at-home steady state.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.560]   You're at home.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.320]   You're not out on your assignments where you're traveling.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.120]   You have a lot of logistical work to do.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.440]   You have admin to do, contracts and your website up to date, processing whatever photos from
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.800]   another trip, whatever it is you do as a landscape photographer, marketing, drumming up new business,
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.320]   calls, quotes, you know, whatever, however that business works.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.300]   Then you have the seasons where you're on the road.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.300]   These are the periods where you're traveling.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.440]   You're in the middle of an engagement.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.560]   This is where you've told everyone you're landscape photography, doing landscape photography
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   for two months overseas.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.640]   You're really assassinating people with grout wire, but whatever, you're on the road.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.920]   And then the third common season or period for you is what I will call the post-trip
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   recovery.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.800]   You just got back from a trip.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.320]   You have literally assassinated dozens of people.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.880]   You're exhausted, it's mentally demanding, and you can't just, you find it difficult
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.720]   to fall right back into, let me be on email and Zoom and answering, you know, client inquiries
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.800]   all day.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   Treat each of those seasons differently.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:21.320]   When I say treat it differently, have different routines and rules that you deploy.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.520]   Routines and rules, and maybe we'll throw in their standards that you deploy for each
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   of those seasons.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.040]   So the way you handle the at-home admin period is going to be very sort of Cal Newport in
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.480]   the middle of the semester style.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.160]   Your quarterly plan influences your weekly plan.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.160]   You make a good weekly plan.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.880]   The weekly plan influences your daily time block plan.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.740]   You're working for set hours, maybe six to eight hours a day.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.600]   You're using your time well.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.280]   Schedule shutdown complete to differentiate between work and non-work.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.480]   Just sort of standard steady state Cal Newport stuff.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.720]   You're getting stuff done, but you're not overwhelmed.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.000]   You're full capture, so you're not too stressed, but making progress on lots of things.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Great.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   When you're on the road during those seasons, it's probably very different.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.920]   You batten down the hatches.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.760]   I mean, if this is demanding, which it seems like it is, you have procedures for this.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   People know that you can't be reached unless it's an emergency.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.240]   You're bouncing back inquiries.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.120]   There's not email inboxes that are picking up.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.880]   You're careful not to have ongoing unrelated projects that require tending while you're
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   away.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.200]   So you can really give your full attention to wink, wink landscape photography.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.760]   And then I think you should have this post-trip recovery season where you say, "I'm done with
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.800]   the trip, but I need two weeks.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   I need two weeks."
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.760]   And you have a completely different standard for those two weeks.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.920]   Maybe it's like you take two days completely off with your family.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.120]   Then the next three days, it's like one hour every morning to start getting your arms around
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.760]   processing the photos or like some sort of admin that is generated as annoyance.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.520]   You're kind of spreading it out.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.920]   And like one hour of emergency email or beginning to like rebuild your recovery list.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.120]   Maybe you just have like a couple hours of work you do a day.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.800]   And then the next week it's like three hours, but no projects.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.440]   You're recovering.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.200]   And then the third week after that, that recovery has slowly gotten you up to the place where
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.320]   now you can jump back into your admin season.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.440]   So I would say lean into the fact that your job feels different at different times and
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.800]   optimize your rules, rituals, and standards for each of those times.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:24.040]   In general, everyone who is able to have this type of autonomy over the work should think
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.960]   about it this way.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   And I think steady state, intense period, recovery period, those are three pretty generally
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.840]   applicable seasons for like lots of people.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.080]   If you're a freelancer or you run your own solopreneur business or you run a small company
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.760]   or you have a lot of autonomy on your team or you're a professor or a writer, think about
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.360]   steady state, intense periods, recovery periods.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.000]   It's three different types, three different types of work and you treat each of them differently.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.200]   I think it's much more interesting, much more sustainable, much more natural than just let
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   me be at this 80% mark every single day.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.840]   Eight hours, fully time blocked, day after day after day, week after week after week,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.600]   month after month after month.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   All right.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:16.160]   So as mentioned, I do want to do a deep dive segment here in particular, a CalReactsToTheNew
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.840]   segment.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:24.720]   John Haidt has this big, splashy new Atlantic article titled, the online version is titled,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.960]   Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Has Been Uniquely Stupid.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.840]   It's a big anti-social media polemic.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.680]   This is like put it in my veins type content and I want to get into it.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:42.800]   But first let us hear from a couple of the sponsors that make the Deep Questions podcast
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   possible.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:50.160]   Let's start by talking about Blinkist, a long time sponsor of the show.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.040]   You've heard me talk about it many times before.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:58.420]   It is a subscription service that gives you short 15 minute summaries called Blinks of
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.000]   thousands of bestselling and important nonfiction books.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.640]   You can read the Blinks or you can listen to them.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.520]   So you can actually get these summaries while you are on the move.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.160]   I have a clear way I suggest using Blinkist, which is to help figure out what books to
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.820]   read or not read.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:23.600]   When an idea is useful to you, you can go find, or you want to find out more about an
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.360]   idea, look at books that are related to it, read or listen to the Blinks.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.840]   You'll get the lay of the land, the conceptual lay of the land surrounding that idea.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.040]   So you know the vocabulary, you know the major points, and you can figure out which of these
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:42.000]   books if any is worth me actually buying and reading in more detail.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.960]   So for example, you want to know more about technology being addictive.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.680]   Look at the Blink for my friend Adam Alter's book, Irresistible.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.080]   Get the main ideas, figure out if you need to read it.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.880]   In that case, I would say you probably do.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.660]   Interested in Yuval Harari?
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.440]   Read the Blink for Homo Deus.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   Read the Blink for 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.960]   Say, is it worth actually diving into?
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.840]   So you can get the lay of the land, the conceptual lay of the land surrounding that idea.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   You can go find, or you want to find out more about an idea.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.480]   So you know the vocabulary, you know the major points, and you can figure out if you need
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   to read it.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   So for example, you want to know more about technology being addictive.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.480]   Read the Blink for Homo Deus.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.480]   Read the Blink for 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.480]   Say, is it worth actually diving into?
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   Read the Blink for 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   Say, is it worth actually diving into?
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.480]   You done any good Blinks recently, Scarecrow Jesse?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   It's not relevant.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   I just reread How to Become a High School Superstar by Cal Newport once a week.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   All wisdom needed for life can be found in that book.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   Well, I appreciate that, Scarecrow Jesse.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.480]   I like that book too.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   One of my more underrated books.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   We're also sponsored by Athletic Greens.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   Athletic Greens is a product that I actually use every morning.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   What it is is a powder you add to water.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.480]   This powder has over 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, whole food source, superfoods, probiotics,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   and adaptogens, all carefully selected high-quality sources that will actually work.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   This is all Athletic Greens does is make this one product, AG1.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.480]   They're constantly improving it, constantly making it better, so you don't have to worry
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   about 100 supplements.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   You don't have to worry about what you're missing from your diet, what food it is you
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   thought you might not be getting.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.480]   This will ensure that you are getting the right base amounts of all of the stuff that
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   you need.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   That's why I take it every morning.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   It's a backstop for my health.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   What else we got here?
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   Oh, 7,000 five-star reviews, recommended by professional athletes, trusted by health experts
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   such as Tim Ferriss and Michael Gervais.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   Sounds good to me.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   I am one of those experts too, I suppose.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   But anyways, it's what I take.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   It's what I use.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   I don't want to bother with supplements.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   I don't want to bother with vitamins.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.480]   God forbid I don't want to go to GNC, so I take my Athletic Greens.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.480]   So, right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   daily nutrition, especially as we are in flu and cold season.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   And can I just say this?
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   I'm not making any claim here, but let me just say this.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   My schedule got uprooted recently, a few weeks ago, because I was doing this faculty hiring,
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.480]   and I got out of my Athletic Greens habit in the morning.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   I got a nasty cold.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   All right, now look, I'm not making a claim here.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   Correlation is not proof of causation, but I'm just saying.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   Messed up my Athletic Greens schedule, got a nasty cold because I wasn't taking it, got
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   a nasty cold.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   I'm just going to say that.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   Two observations.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   Connect them if you will.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   So, Athletic Greens is just one scoop in a cup of water every day.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480]   That's it.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   No need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you free a one-year supply of immune
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/deep.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   Again, that is athleticgreens.com/deep to take ownership over your health and pick up
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480]   Athletic Greens.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.480]   Scarecrow Jesse, what do you do for your nutrition every day?
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   Well, I slaughter and eat a live rabbit once a day and I drink the yolks of half a dozen
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   eggs with every meal.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.480]   Scarecrow Jesse, I don't know.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   That doesn't seem very healthy.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   Maybe Athletic Greens would be easier for you.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.480]   Don't tell me.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   Don't tell me what supplements I can use.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   Live rabbit devoured, half dozen egg yolks every meal.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   That is the solution.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   Well, to each their own.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   I will say, though, you have no arms or legs, so I'm not sure if I would take health advice
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   from you.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   All right.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.480]   So let's do a Cal Reacts to the News segment.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   As promised, I want to talk about this article from The Atlantic online.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   It's titled, "Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Has Been Uniquely Stupid."
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   In the magazine, it was called "After Babble" and is an epic article by, I'm going to say
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   friend of the show.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   What I mean is someone that people who listen to this show enjoy, John Haidt.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   So I've talked to John Haidt once or twice.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   I don't know him well, but I really respect his work because he has psychology training.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   He can work with literatures in an academic way, but also has a real mind towards cultural
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.480]   criticism and public-facing work, which I think is great.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   So I'm a big John Haidt fan, so I was excited to see this article.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   I'm going to read just a few highlights, some highlighted sentences from this article, and
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   then I'm going to give you some thoughts on it.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   All right.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   So one thing he says here is, "Something went terribly wrong very suddenly with America
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   in the 2010s."
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   As he clarifies, "In the first decade of the new century," so the 2000 to the late 2000,
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   like 2009, 2010, "social media was widely believed to be a boon to democracy."
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   Haidt argues, "The high point of techno-democratic optimism was arguably 2011, a year that began
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.480]   with the Arab Spring and ended with the global Occupy movement."
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   He goes on, however, to say, okay, and he clarifies also, "In their early incarnations,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   platforms such as MySpace and Facebook were relatively harmless.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   They allowed users to create pages on which to post photos, family updates, and link to
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   mostly static pages of their friends and favorite bands.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   In this way, early social media can be seen as just another step in the long progression
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   of technological improvements from the postal service through the telephone to email and
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   texting, all of which helped people achieve the eternal goal of maintaining their social
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   ties."
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   All right?
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   So John Haidt is setting things up where there's going to be this fall, the 2010s.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   And in the first decade of the 2000s, basically, we are in a more hedonic, hedonic time where
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   social media was great.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   It was helping people connect to their friends and bands and get new information.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.480]   It was helping to overthrow dictators, and everyone's really happy.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   And what he argues is there was a major change.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:01.480]   So what was this major change that happened to social media that set up the fall that
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   he talks about in this piece?
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   Well, he goes on to give his theory.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   He says, okay, look, in 2009 and before, if you're on Facebook, you had a simple timeline,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   a never-ending stream of content generated by friends and connections with the newest
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   post at the top and the oldest at the bottom.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   That began to change in 2009 when Facebook offered users a way to publicly like posts
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   with the click of a button.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   That same year, Twitter introduced something even more powerful, the retweet button, which
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   allowed users to publicly endorse a post while also sharing it with all their followers.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   Facebook soon copied that innovation with its own share button, which became available
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.480]   to smartphone users in 2012.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   Like and share buttons quickly became standard on most social media platforms.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   Shortly after its like button began to produce data about what best engaged its users, Facebook
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   developed algorithms to bring each user the content most likely to generate a like or
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   some other interaction, eventually including the share as well.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.480]   By 2013, social media had become a new game with dynamics unlike those in 2008.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   If you were skillful or lucky, you might create a post that would go viral and make you internet
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   famous for a few days.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   If you blundered, you could find yourself buried in hateful comments.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   This new game encouraged dishonesty and mob dynamics.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   Users were guided not just by their true preferences, but by their past experiences of reward and
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   punishment and the prediction of how others would react to each new action.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   So that is the story that height tells for what is essentially the fall of social media,
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   the fall from grace of social media.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   So this is a story, it's a tale of techno determinism.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   I talk about this in digital minimalism.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   I've talked about this in an article I wrote for the communications of the ACM.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   It's a point I've been making a lot recently, which is we have to be incredibly aware of
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   unintentional techno social dynamics where a technology introduced for one period can
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   have massive influences that we weren't expecting.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   We should be monitoring those and aware of those and reacting to those.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.480]   We often don't.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.480]   And as height says, this is what happened with the like and retweet button.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   It completely changed the character of social media.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   Where social media used to be about connecting to people, posting information, connecting,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   it became instead about viral dynamics.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   What's going to be a hit?
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.480]   What is going to avoid me being attacked?
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   You don't have that without retweet.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   You don't have that without likes.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   But once it became this algorithmic stream with viral dynamics, it completely changed
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   the character.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   It wasn't the intention.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   As I talk about in my book, Digital Minimalism, the intention of the like button originally
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   was that engineers thought it was not elegant that someone would post a photo on Facebook
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   and so many comments would say more or less the same thing.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   Awesome, cool, great, good.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   Like, well, let's just put a like button in so that if all you're going to say is like,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   that's great, just click that button and we'll count up how many people said that so that
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   you don't have to waste time scrolling through comments that are all just simple positive
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   affirmations.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   That was the point of the like button.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   But almost immediately, it completely changed the dynamics of Facebook because A, it made
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   it more addictive because you began to care about how many likes your things got.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   And B, it gave them data that they could use to create algorithmically generated streams,
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.480]   which broke the whole model of I know you and Facebook is great because I can see what
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   you're up to and made into this model of, oh my God, what am I seeing in my news feed?
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   This is interesting, this is outrageous, this is emotionally engaged, and it completely
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   changed the dynamic.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   So is that a bad thing?
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   Well, Haidt says it's undermining democracy.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.480]   It is like one of the worst things to happen is the social media platforms going towards
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   this optimized streams that create, equipped with or augmented with viral dynamics.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   He gives three things he said went wrong once we switch to this.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Number one, it gave more power to tools and provocateurs while silencing good citizens.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   Number two, this approach gave more power and voice to the political extremes while
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   reducing the power and voice of the moderate majority.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   Because again, when you have viral dynamics in terms of both praise and attack, you migrate
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   to the extremes.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   A, you're not going to get shared for saying things moderate, and two, the extremes are
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   going to be motivated to pile on or try to attack people that seem like they're drifting
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   from it.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   He cites the pro-democracy group More in Common, a very important survey.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   Back in 2017, they surveyed 8,000 Americans and they split the Americans up into seven
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   groups that shared beliefs and behaviors.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   And they found that devoted conservatives comprised 6% of the US population and the
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   group furthest to the left, what they called progressive activists, comprised just 8% of
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   the population.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   And the progressive activists in particular were the most prolific group on social media.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.480]   70% had shared political content over the previous years and the devoted conservatives
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   were also very active on social media.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   At least 56% had shared political content.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   And the irony, he points out, is that those two groups tend to be both richer than the
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   average American and wider than the average American.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   So that we have, quote, two subsets of the elite who are not representative of the broader
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   society that are completely driving sort of extreme conversation on social media.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   Finally, he says, social media in this new form deputize everyone to administer just
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   as with no due process.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   Platforms like Twitter devolve into the wild west with no accountability for vigilantes.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   A successful attack attracts a barrage of likes and follow on strikes.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   Enhanced virality platforms thereby facilitate massive collective punishment for small or
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   imagined offenses with real world consequences including innocent people losing their jobs
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   and being shamed into suicide.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   When our public square is governed by mob dynamics unrestrained by due process, we don't
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.480]   get justice and inclusion.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   We get a society that ignores context, proportionality, mercy, and truth.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   So we get that happening as well.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   That is, again, another point I will just say, I hear this a lot in conversations about
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   social media, content, content moderations.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.480]   This came up, I think, in the context of last week's discussion of Elon Musk and Twitter
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   where people say, no, I think it's good.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   Look, it's good that there's blowback.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   If you're worried about saying something, that means you should be worried about saying
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   it.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   And you often hear the phrase, free speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   You can say what you want, but you have to be ready for the consequences.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   And I think what Haidt is pointing out here is that on its own is a vacuous statement.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   You look at any example in history where there is a clearly, let's say, authoritarian regime
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   dispensing arbitrary dictatorial justice.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.480]   Let's look at Stalin throwing people into the gulag.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   If you were to go there and see what was going on, he was not just saying, I have arbitrary
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   power, and I'm putting you in the gulag because I don't like you, and what are you going to
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   do about it?
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   No, there'd be a trial.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   And he would say, look, he would say the similar sort of thing.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   What you say, things have consequences.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   You were a treasonous to the country.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   This treason is going to unsettle the communist utopia.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   Your actions have consequences, and you're doing something dangerous.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   You need to go to the gulag.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   I mean, that's true of any time, anywhere.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   So what you have to do, of course, is with some humanity and common sense, just look
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   at the particular context and say, is this largely actually just or is it disproportionate?
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   So if you're in Stalin's Russia, you would say this is very disproportionate.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.480]   He's sending people to the gulag, clearly because he just doesn't like them, or they're
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   not on his team, or he's trying to make sure that he can preserve power.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   And obviously, things aren't that bad now, but I think a lot of neutral observers looking
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.480]   at the swiftness and virality of pylons, both on the left and right, would say, this can't
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   possibly be proportional and just.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   It just doesn't seem that way.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   Our common sense is saying that's not true.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   So I don't buy the argument of, hey, you can say what you want, consequences, but you
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   can't be free from consequences.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.480]   That applies in every context.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   What matters is, are the consequences we've seen, as Haidt would say, proportional, merciful,
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   and truthful?
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   And often they're not, and it's because, as Haidt points out, the viral dynamics of these
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:39.480]   platforms have pushed out most of the middle, pushed out most normal people.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   We have these two extremes on either side, completely disproportionate of the population
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   that not only control the conversation but are doing so in an incredibly aggressive way
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   because they're trying to play the dynamics of great viral reward while avoiding or participating
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   in great viral punishment.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.480]   And so it really is a wild west of a small number of disproportionate vigilantes running
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   around.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   And he thinks that's very destabilizing, and I think he's probably true.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   All right.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   So what do we do about it?
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   Well, I don't have a definitive answer, but there's a couple points I want to make.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   First of all, I think I am somewhat alone in my argument that I do not think Twitter
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   is as fundamental as everyone else does.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   Haidt makes this point.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   Elon Musk has recently made this point.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.480]   They're all saying this is the town square.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   It's critical to democracy.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   That's why we really have to care about it.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.480]   I don't think it's critical to democracy.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   I don't think it's the town square.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:43.480]   I think if Haidt is right that what Twitter is is 11% of the population segregated at
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:50.480]   all extremes, playing this weird viral vigilante game of viral reward and viral punishment,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   maybe being observed by a larger group of people who find the emotions of this kind
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   of entertaining.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   This is not the public town square.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   This is the Coliseum.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   This is the gladiator to the fights to the death that people in Rome will wander over
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   to watch because it's bloody and interesting and is better than doing something else.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   It's kind of exciting, but it's not at the core of democracy.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   How do we know that?
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   Because what would happen if, for whatever reason, let's say Elon succeeds and his latest
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   thing is he wants to buy Twitter, he made an offer.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   Let's say he just shuts it down.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   Nothing bad would happen.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   85% of the country or 90% of the country wouldn't even notice because most people don't use
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   Twitter.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   You don't need Twitter to report the news.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   You don't need Twitter to be a politician.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   You don't need Twitter to be entertaining.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   Nothing bad would happen.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.480]   People would barely notice.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   It would have less of an impact than supply chain disruption for toilet paper.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.480]   How could that be critical to the town square?
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   It's a Coliseum.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   It's not the Roman Senate.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   That is my argument.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   Once we recognize that, then I would argue we need to downgrade the importance of Twitter.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   It's weird.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   It's this weird 240 characters or whatever it is now with these weird viral dynamics,
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   these little boxes with these threads, and it's this weird bloody gladiator game.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   We say, "I'm leaving the Coliseum."
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   Here's what I think we need instead.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   A, we replace the distraction that Twitter gives whoever it gives distraction to with
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   better distraction.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   There's better things to do if you're bored.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   Yeah, it's exciting, but listen to a podcast, read a book, have a better hobby.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   There's all sorts of things you can do that are interesting and entertaining, more so
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   than these weird short character threads of extreme people fighting each other.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   Two, I think social media itself needs to fragment much more and get back more
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   towards that 2000 to 2009 period where it is about connecting to people that you
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.480]   find interesting and know, expressing yourself.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Social media should be more niche.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   It should be more about like people felt MySpace was in the early days or Facebook
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   was in the early days.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   Here is a group of amateur bicyclists, and we connect with each other, and we
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   share photos of our rides, and encourage each other, and we have our own norms,
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   and our own way of talking, and it's great, and I'm glad it exists because
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.480]   there's not enough amateur cyclists who live near me to actually meet that many
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   people.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   And that's what social media should be.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   It should not try to be a virtual town square.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   There should not be a service that everyone feels like they have to use.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   That doesn't work.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   Finally, C, we need better ways for those who actually do have important, useful,
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   or thought-provoking information to share to use the internet to share that.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   There is no reason why the best and brightest, the most interesting, the
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   smartest, the most engaging thinkers and writers out there should be constrained
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.480]   to a small number of characters, retweets, and linking, and adding, and all of
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.480]   these weird, arbitrary rules that serve to do nothing but virality.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   Virality is not useful for giving you the ability to share and express yourself,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   and to hear what other people are saying.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   It's really not that useful for it.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   The internet existed before the retweet.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   Social media and the internet existed before the like button.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   So I think we need perhaps an earlier Web 2.0 type approach, podcasts, blogs,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   individual websites where you can express yourself at length and in detail.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   And yes, it's harder to find attention when you're kind of on your own,
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   but that I think is a feature.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   That means you're going to gather a more focused crowd.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   The best will rise to the top.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   You know, yeah, most podcasts don't get listened to, but ones that are
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   interesting get big audiences.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   It's harder, but it's longer form.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   It's more nuanced, and it doesn't have viral dynamics.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   It doesn't create these weird pushes to the extremes.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   I wrote an article about this for Wired magazine early in the pandemic,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   where I said the best thing we could do from a public health perspective
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   during the pandemic would probably be shut down Twitter.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   It's just going to make people crazy.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   It's going to push people in weird directions.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   It's not going to help our psychological or physical health during a pandemic.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   And my argument in that Wired piece was we should go back to blogs for medical
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   experts, and they should be hosted on institutional websites so we trust it.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:25.480]   Oh, this doctor works for this medical network.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   The blog is posted on that network.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   Like, we're already validating, like, this is where this person comes from.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   Here's why I should trust them.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   And he's not doing tweet threads of screenshotted charts.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   He can write a real article.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   And, yeah, if you wanted to use social media to say I published a new article,
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   you can find it here, fine.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   But that was the appropriate form because it allows us to do curation of who we
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   should be listening to to get more information, to have context,
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   to have nuance.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   Twitter was a terrible medium for that type of discussion.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   So I think we need to go back or forward, we could even say, to a way of
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   communicating and expressing ourselves that doesn't constrain us to these weird,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   narrow platforms that are built around virality and active user minutes,
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   not around the most effective ways to convey information.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.480]   All right, so that's my thoughts on this general point.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   I think John Haidt is right and perceptive.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   I think he clarified better.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   I made this argument, he clarifies it a little bit better,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   that as you shifted from -- the way I usually put it is as you shifted from the
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   wall to the news feed, as you shifted from looking at friends' posts to liking
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   and retweeting, you got these weird viral dynamics that transformed the social
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.480]   media landscape into this weird group of extremes and vigilantes that's had a
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   huge negative effect.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   And, again, most people don't use Twitter, but reporters use it,
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   politicians use it, corporate executives look at it, and it has,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.480]   so therefore, a huge outsized effect.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   And to me, again, it's not the town square, it's not the Roman Senate,
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480]   it's the Coliseum.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   And we're letting the bloody combat in the Coliseum, as entertaining as it is to
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   look at in the moment, we're letting that actually dictate the way the rest of us
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   live their lives, how news is covered, how politicians act as legislatures,
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:17.480]   how companies set policy or change their directives or initiatives or even decide
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.480]   who to hire or fire.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   And this is crazy.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   The Coliseum should not have a major role.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   There is nothing fundamental about this technology.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   We can do better with the Internet, and I hope we actually do.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   So that's my thought on John Haidt's article on Twitter.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   So good job, John Haidt.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.480]   And that would be what I add to it.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   I mean, the one exception where we do need Twitter, I think, is Baseball Trade
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   Rumors, because I need that information fast.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   But, hey, look, that's an example, though.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.480]   Yeah, Twitter is good for getting Baseball Trade Rumor information fast,
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.480]   but there's a website, mlbtraderumors.com, that works just as well,
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   and it's focused on just that.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   And I'll tell you something, and then I'll let this go,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   but I'll tell you something.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   That is where I went to see what was going on in the highly compressed free
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   agency that happened in March after the collective bargaining agreement was
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   made, finalized for MLB, because specifically I did not want to go to
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   Twitter to see what the baseball reporters were saying, because Twitter was
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   going to push in my face terrible, terrifying news about Ukraine and
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   nuclear war and about COVID.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.480]   And I was like, I don't want to go to the Coliseum to find out about my
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   team, and so I went to a special purpose website, got the news I wanted
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   without the stress.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   So case in point, that's the future we need.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   All right, well, why don't we do a couple more questions here.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   43 minutes.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   Jesse, I'm going to, as I always say, I'm going to try to bring this
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   episode in for a landing fast.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   Yeah, right, I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   Well, I think without actual Jesse here, I'm going to feel more, more
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   svelte, move a little bit quicker.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   I have said that literally every episode.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   So we've got a question here from Jeremy.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   Jeremy says, how do I apply your ideas to skilled labor?
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   Can you discuss how you would implement practices of the deep work
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   methodology to work in the trades and the skilled labor sector?
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.480]   I'm a home builder, general contractor, and find it difficult to attain
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.480]   a deep work practice because everything I do is dealing with uncontrolled
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   variables, client needs, other trades, employee management, scheduling,
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.480]   that make it hard to stay focused on the actual building with my hands.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   Well, Jeremy, it's a good question.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   I'd be careful about the use of the word deep work there.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   I mean, again, deep work is a specific type of activity, but I get what
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   you're going at.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   Like what you're going at here, I think, is you feel like you're in a
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.480]   hyperactive hive mind type setup.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   You're constantly reacting to all sorts of different uncontrolled,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   unpredictable variables, and it gets in the way of actually doing the core
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   work, whether we want to call that deep or not, of doing the skilled labor.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   I think this is a common mistake that a lot of people make.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   They think that the type of anti-hyperactive hive mind organizational
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   systems and philosophies I talk about is for knowledge work only, for people
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   on Zoom meetings doing email all day.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   That's not true.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   Actually, in the trades, these ideas could be even more important and
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   applicable.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   The key is in your situation, if you do skilled labor, is systems,
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   systems, systems, systems.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.480]   You have to get out of a state in which you are generally available to anyone
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   who needs you whenever they need you.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   Yes, in the moment, that is easy.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   Systems are a pain, and people don't like them in the moment.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   But if you just make yourself available to anyone who needs you whenever they
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   need you, it will be incredibly frustrating.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   You're not going to get a lot done.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   You're going to be miserable.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   So in the trades, you need someone managing the phone, someone who can do
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   that for you.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   You probably need an office manager to help deal with scheduling and employee
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   logistics and tax filings.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   You don't want to be doing all that stuff on your own.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   Yes, you're going to have to spend more money to do this, but it's going to
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   allow your business to grow.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   Let me tell you what's going to grow businesses in the skilled trades.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   I've heard nothing grows a business in the skilled trades more than you're
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   reliable.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.480]   I can call and office manager answers.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   The person always gets back to them in a timely fashion.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   If something is scheduled, it happens, especially when you're dealing with
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   annoying knowledge worker types like us, which are kind of used to calendars and
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   Zoom meetings, and when things happen, they're supposed to happen.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   If you can play in that idiom, if you can basically be, I know how to reach
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   this person.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480]   I know how it works.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   He shows up.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   He's reliable.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   You'll have all the customers in the world.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.480]   Even if you're like, oh, I don't have time to do this person.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   Don't ghost them.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   You have a system.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   Like, hey, here's what, yeah, we don't have room.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   Here's the waiting list.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   Here's what's going on.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   Anyways, so yes, the stuff I'm going to talk about might require some more
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   employees, might cost more money, but you're going to make more money in the
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   end.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   So your office manager should then be equipped with good systems for payroll,
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   invoicing, et cetera.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.480]   Automate all that.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   Have set systems for that.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   Do not do that ad hoc.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   You should not be on the fly, sending emails or answering questions.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   You need pre-planned check-ins and planning sessions with all of the relevant
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   people in your work.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   You check in with the people back at the home office three times during the day.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   That's when they tell you who called, what's going on.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   You can confer, answer quick questions, et cetera.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   Not just them calling you whenever they need you.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   When you're on a job site, you have set check-in times with the clients.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   You give them a full update and they can ask or answer their questions.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   Maybe you have an end of the day rule.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   You know, yeah, send me a message or call the person at the home office and I
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   have an hour at the end of every day where I call people back.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   We'll see what's going on.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   Again, people want clarity, not just accessibility.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   You have specific times and days you do things like estimates or site visits.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.480]   You really want to structure and automate all of this.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   You can use text and email.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.480]   I learned this from a builder, actually.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   I talked about this in my book, A World Without Email, a commercial real
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   estate builder.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   Make text and email be only for questions that can be answered with no back
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   and forth.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   Questions you can answer with one sentence with no back and forth.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   Yeah, that's more efficient to have that just be sent on email.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   So when you get time to look through email, you can answer those.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   Anything that requires back and forth, get it out of email, wait until the
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   preplanned check-in time.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   So, look, I don't want to be too specific here, Jeremy, because I don't know
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   your exact business.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   But you should get the sense of what I'm going for.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.480]   What I'm going for here is you structure your interactions, you have help, you
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   have systems so that you know what you're supposed to be doing at any one
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.480]   time.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   You're not at any one time beholden to a huge number of unpredictable requests
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.480]   for your time and attention.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   It's a little bit more structured, you're going to have to hire some more
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   people.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   But honestly, it's going to make you better at what you do.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.480]   People are going to like working with you better.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   You're going to do better work.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   You'll triple the size of your business.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   So it is worth it.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   All right, we have a question here from Lira.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   Lira says, "How do you deal with unexpected overload and burnout that you
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   can't really ease?
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   I'm a 26-year-old Spanish ESL teacher and nutrition student from Spain.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   I've been working at an academy teaching English part-time for the last year
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   and a half.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   I'm also finishing my degree project for university from home and working at a
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.480]   bookstore owned by family members.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.480]   Due to the owner having an unexpected illness, my hours at the store have
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:46.480]   doubled and I have to work for another three months, blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   Now I get up very early to work on my project before working at the store all
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   morning.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   I'm feeling burnt out, I'm not well rested, and I'm feeling stressed most of
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   the time.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   I have a plan, keep to-do list that I assign specific days and times, plan my
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   days so I can fit everything, and have started quarterly planning since
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   September, which does help keep my eye on my goals and figure out the next
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   steps, but this does not help with burnout.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   Could it be I'm simply adjusting to the increased workload, or what would you
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   recommend?"
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:17.480]   Well, Lira, first of all, I understand the state you're in.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   I get there often myself where I have a lot of things on my plate.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   Because I'm very organized, I can make it fit.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   So it's not like things are being left behind or I'm scrambling to stay up all
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   night long to try to get deadlines on.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   It's not that type of stress of I don't have enough time to get things done, but
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   it's exhausting.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.480]   Every minute is scheduled right up to a shutdown.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   You feel like there's no gaps in that time block schedule, your full intensity
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   all day long.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   I find that exhausting, and that's exactly the situation you're in.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   And you're exhausting, A, because of just constant labor.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   That's just physically draining day after day after day to do that.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   It's just draining.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   It also, at least this is my theory, short circuits the planning centers of our
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   brain, which aren't used to having so many things on our plate.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   Yes, with artificial help and tools like multiscale planning, we can make it
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   work, but our brain doesn't really know about that.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   And so it can't wrap its mind about all the different stuff on your plate, and so
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   it's freaked out about it.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   How are we going to get this all done?
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.480]   It's used to a slower pace of execution.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   So you're straight up exhausted, and you have the negative effect of this
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   planning center short circuiting.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   That's why you feel burnout.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   So here's the cure.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.480]   Do fewer things.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   Take more breaks.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   That means one of these things going on in your life you're going to have to
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.480]   pause or stop.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   Now, I think you know that this is the answer.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   And the reason why I think you know this is the answer is that in the full
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   version of your question -- I condensed this -- but in the full version of your
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.480]   question, you were very careful around each of the things you introduced that
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   was drawn from your time, to put these disclaimers that explained why there
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   wasn't more blood to squeeze from that turnip.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   You didn't have options to make it easier.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   You didn't have options to make it more flexible, to spread it out more, like
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.480]   this is its demands, I can't change it.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   You said that for each of the things.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   So you were preemptively trying to sidestep an answer that was like, with a
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   little bit more organization, with a little bit more savvy in how you lay
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.480]   things out, maybe things will feel better.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.480]   Because I think you knew the answer was, that's not going to solve it.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   There's too much raw stuff on my plate, and it's exhausting me.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   And you were looking for permission from me to take things off your plate.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   And I'm giving you that permission right now.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   We have a hard time with this, taking things off our plate.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   Especially those of us like you, Lira, who are driven and ambitious and
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   interesting and doing interesting stuff.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   All these things you're doing are either interesting or admirable.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   You're helping your family, you're getting a degree, you're working on a big
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   project, and we feel bad about taking stuff away.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   But let me tell you, when you zoom out and look at these pictures, in the big
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   scale, it's not a big deal.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   You're going through a period of, you said, three more months where you have to
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   take extra shifts at a bookstore to help your family.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   Okay, that's nice.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   So maybe you need to delay the nutrition degree by a semester.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   Or not do your project yet.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   Say, look, we have this family thing going on, I have to help out.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   In the big picture, it's not going to matter.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   You're going to get your degree, you're going to finish your project, you
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.480]   helped your family, you spread this out by another six months, it's not a big deal.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   But in the moment, it feels like failure.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   Because stepping back, adding things makes us feel good.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.480]   Hey, look how admirable and ambitious I am.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   I'm doing all these interesting things.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   Stepping back from things makes us feel bad, or like something bad is happening.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   Or like there was a failure.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   And we amplify in our mind how much other people are going to care when we do
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   that reality check.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   They don't, they're thinking about themselves, they're barely going to notice.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   I used to encounter this in a dramatic way when I was a grad student at MIT.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.480]   And I was writing student books, and I was advising, informally advising
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.480]   undergraduates to help them apply my advice to their lives.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   And the tradeoff was I would then write about them on my blog,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   anonymously, or student anonymously.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   But I would like, let me help you get your life in order as a student,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.480]   and then let me write about it.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.480]   I had a series on my blog called College Chronicles back then,
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   where I'd write about it.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.480]   And I remember I would come across students, and there was one in particular.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.480]   I remember this one student, and I called her Lena.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   It's not a real name, but I called her Lena.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.480]   She was at MIT, and she was an undergraduate.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   And she had all this stuff on her plate because she was so ambitious.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   Her family and her school back home were so proud.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   She got to MIT, and she didn't want to let them down.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   So she had three majors in all these clubs.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   And she was the person everyone was always impressed by.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   And the only lever she knew how to pull to increase impressiveness was quantity,
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   quantity of activities.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   But she was having trouble.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.480]   And so I worked with her.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.480]   I said, let's look at all of your obligations and figure out how much time
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   they need each week.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   And let's try to figure out a schedule, a student autopilot schedule.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.480]   We can make time for each of these things so it's automatic.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   Tuesday at this time, I work on my problem set.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   Wednesday after dinner, I'm at this club meeting.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   And we did this exercise, and we ran out of time.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   Even if she worked every hour of the day from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   she still couldn't get all the work done, even in a normal week where there
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   wasn't like extra exams or projects due.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   I said, this is black and white, Lena.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.480]   You have to quit things.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   You have to stop doing three majors.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   You can't do all these clubs.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   You literally don't have time.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   Black and white.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   She couldn't do it.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.480]   She couldn't do it because to quit something or walk away from something would
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   be her stepping away from accomplishment, stepping away from ambition.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   It would be letting people down.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   And I've told this story before, but what happened to Lena was she burnt out
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.480]   and had to take a leave of absence, a medical leave of absence for mental
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   health issues.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   Fried her brain.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   So I understand the difficulty here.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.480]   But this is me telling you and giving you the permission I think that you want
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   from me.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.480]   Do less.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   Spread it out.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   Give yourself a break.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   Give yourself breathing room.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.480]   You're young.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   None of this is incredibly time sensitive.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.480]   When you look back 10 years from now, you're not even going to know the
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   difference between getting all this done in the next three months and spending
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   eight months instead.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   But in the moment, it's going to be night and day.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   It's going to be the difference between physical breakdown and exhaustion and
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   all of the things that can lead to depression, deep procrastination, health
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.480]   issues.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   It's going to be the difference between that and like actually having some
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   autonomy, control, gratitude, and depth in life.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   So that's what I'm going to say, Lyra.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   Do less.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   I give you permission.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   Quit the lay.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   It's not retreating from your ambition.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   It's tackling it in a way that's going to be sustainable in the long term.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.480]   I got another question.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.480]   I got one last question I want to get to.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.480]   First, let me just talk about another sponsor that makes this show possible,
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.480]   and that is Ladder.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   You know, life is precarious.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   We just came out of a pandemic.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   There is a war with the nuclear power going on.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   Life is scary.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   Life is precarious.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   One thing that can help you feel a little bit better about that is having life
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   insurance.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.480]   And if you're going to get life insurance, the type you want to get is term
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   coverage, which can be surprisingly affordable.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   You should be paying a bit each month to protect the ones you love.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   And if you need life insurance, let me tell you the right way to get it.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   Ladder.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   Ladder is 100% digital.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.480]   No doctors, no needles, no paperwork.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.480]   When you apply for 3 million in coverage or less,
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   just answer a few questions about your health and an application.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   You'll need just a few minutes on a phone or laptop to apply.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.480]   Their smart algorithms will then work in real time.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.480]   So you can find out instantly if you are approved, no hidden fees,
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.480]   cancel any time, get a full refund.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   If you change your mind in the first 30 days,
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   it's policies are issued by insurers with proven long proven histories of
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   paying their claims.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   Customers rate ladder 4.8 out of five stars on Trustpilot.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   And because insurance costs more as you age,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   now is the time to cross off your list.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   So if you need life insurance and you're stressed out, you don't have it.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   Just go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you're instantly approved.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   That is L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   That's ladderlife.com/deep to see if you are approved.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.480]   It's the easy way to get life insurance. You need it.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:56.480]   Use ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.480]   Speaking of life insurance, Scarecrow Jesse, as you know,
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.480]   we do have a $20 million life insurance policy on your head.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:14.480]   On an unrelated note, I think it's important that you go do some reporting
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   for me off the coast of South Africa in the water there,
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   what's known for the great whites.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   I need you to do some reporting for me from that water covered in blood.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:31.480]   I can explain later why, but I want you to surround yourself with chum,
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.480]   go into those waters, and it's just a really important reporting thing I need
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.480]   to do. This has nothing to do with the $20 million life insurance.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.480]   This is key to the show that you're swimming in chum in shark infested
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.480]   South African waters.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:47.480]   All right. Speaking of, let me put this another way,
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   completely changing subjects.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   I want to talk also about our sponsor, Headspace.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.480]   Look, we all say fine when we don't mean it,
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   but fine isn't really an emotion, right?
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   I mean, how many times have you told yourself you're fine when all you've
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   really felt is anger or sadness or nerves?
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.480]   This is where Headspace enters the picture.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   It's a scientifically proven to help you manage your feelings and your mental
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   health. It is an app that gives you guided meditations that will make you feel
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.480]   better. In fact, a recent study proves in just two weeks,
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   Headspace can reduce your stress by 14%.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   It can help you relieve stress, anxiety, sleep better,
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   even improve your focus.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   This is important to deep questions listeners.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:36.480]   They have guided meditations to help put you into a focused mood to get better
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   deep work done. I have tried those meditations.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   I like the focus meditations.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   They are really a good way if you're coming out of a lot of nonsense,
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   like let's say you're,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.480]   you're talking to a scarecrow about shark diving and now you need to actually
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.480]   think deep and produce something good.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   Five minute guided focus meditation work wonders great deep work ritual.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   I've also used on occasion, the anxiety,
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.480]   anti-anxiety guided meditations where if you're just in a peak of anxiety,
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.480]   like whatever things are going on, you just get those feelings.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   The ones I've done have focused on breathing. It slows you down.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   It separates you from the feelings themselves. It's quite powerful.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   So Headspace is a useful app to have in your mental health arsenal.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   So however you're feeling try Headspace at headspace.com/questions and get one
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   month free of their entire mindfulness library.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.480]   This is the best Headspace offer available.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.480]   So go to headspace.com/questions today. That's headspace.com/questions.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   All right. Speaking of questions, I got one more. I want to get to Alex asks,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   should I focus on process or results oriented goals?
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   There are two kinds of goals, input based goals,
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   such as hours spent reading or hours working on a project and outputs based
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.480]   goals, such as number of books read per month or certain project milestones,
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   which is better. Neither is better. Alex, they both serve purposes,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.480]   but at different relevant timescales.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:13.480]   So in deep work, I borrow some terminology from the 40 X methodology,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.480]   which is the lead versus lag indicator.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   So what you called process focused, like how many hours you spent reading,
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.480]   they call that a lead indicator, something you can directly track.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.480]   And what you called results focused,
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.480]   like how many books I read or project milestones,
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   they would call lag indicators is what you ultimately want to accomplish.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.480]   And what they talked about in that book,
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.480]   which I think is a good idea even beyond their context is lead indicators are
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.480]   what on the short timescale you should focus on and track.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   If you do daily metric planning,
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.480]   you should be tracking your lead indicators.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.480]   Those lead indicators should then be pushing you towards accomplishing the lag
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   indicators, the bigger goals.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   So at the timescale of quarters or months,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   you might have lag indicator goals.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   I want to get through this series of books.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   I want to double my client count. And you know, that's important.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   You got to track it. Like if you don't know where you're aiming,
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480]   you're not going to get anywhere.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.480]   You got to identify these things you want to do and why they're important and
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   they should be there in your quarterly plan.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.480]   But what do you do on Monday? What do you do on Tuesday at 10 a.m.?
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   That's where the lead indicators come into play. I'm reading 20 pages.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   I'm making three client calls.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   So both of these things have to be in your arsenal.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   They just exist at different scales.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.480]   At the quarterly plan scale,
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   you have your results oriented lag indicators at the daily weekly scale.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   You have your lead indicators,
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   which are the actual actions you're doing and tracking at a fine grain way.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   That's going to help you accumulate the effort and work required to get to
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.480]   those bigger goals. All right.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Well, speaking of goals, I think we went a little over an hour yet.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.480]   No, thanks to you, Scarecrow Jesse, which didn't have much to add.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   Hey man, don't blame me. I do blame you.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   But for all of you who watch this on YouTube,
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   my apologies for the nonsense of the Jesse Scarecrow for all of you who are
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   listening again, congratulations. You skipped that nonsense.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.480]   I'll be back on Thursday with another episode of the Deep Questions podcast.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   And until then, as always stay deep.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.340]   [MUSIC]
