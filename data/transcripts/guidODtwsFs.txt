[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   - Is it rumor when boxers are getting ready for a big fight
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.820]   that they go celibate and they try to bust no nuts?
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.100]   - Oh, I heard that.
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.920]   Nah, but like, I don't know bro.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.400]   It never really happened to me, bro.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.960]   I ain't gonna lie, I never got weak.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.760]   I had sex the day before the fight
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.980]   and like next day I knocked out the guy and went around.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.660]   I would suggest not to do it
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.500]   because I guess it can slow me down, right?
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.920]   For me though, the thing that can throw me off
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.480]   is if I eat before I fight.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320]   - Really?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.520]   - I don't like to eat, I don't like to have nothing
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960]   in my stomach, I like to kind of be in a fasted state
