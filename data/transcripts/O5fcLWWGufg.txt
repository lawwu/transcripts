[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.880]   Good evening, gentlemen, and welcome back.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.720]   A little J.S. Bach from our organist Stephen Sturz.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.760]   He has been serving Grace Community Church
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.640]   and blessing the body of Christ here for 47 years.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.040]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.880]   And J.S. Bach, that great composer
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.360]   who declared that all music should
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.760]   be for the glory of God.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.520]   And that certainly is our aim tonight.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.840]   Psalm 33 says, "Sing for joy in Yahweh, O righteous ones.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.600]   Praise is becoming to the upright.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.840]   Sing to him a new song.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.720]   Play skillfully with a loud shout.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.280]   For the word of Yahweh is upright,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.560]   and all his work is done in faithfulness."
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.800]   So let's sing for joy together as we give glory to God
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.080]   for the great things he has done.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   Please find a hymns of grace and turn to number 19.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.360]   This should make all the old Baptists very happy.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.240]   Number 19, "To God be the glory, great things he has done."
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.720]   And would you stand, please, as we sing?

[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   Thank you once again.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   The African-American spirituals of the 19th century
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   did frame truths and testimonies like nothing else.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   And that was "My Soul's Been Anchored,"
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   arranged by the late Moses Hogan.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   Well, our final choral piece this evening is a familiar hymn.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   And why should the choir sing it when we all could?
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   Well, again, in keeping with our purpose
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   to make truth memorable, my prayer
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   is that the artistry and beauty of this setting--
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   which, by the way, is arranged by Gilbert Martin--
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   the artistry and beauty of the setting
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   would help you to hear and think on this familiar hymn
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   text in a new and profound way when
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   I survey the wondrous cross.

[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   Well, brethren, after-- should I bring this down?
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.860]   OK.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.860]   Just making sure.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   After that wonderful singing, yeah, one can't wait for heaven
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   when all the ransomed throng of God
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:57.860]   will join our voices to praise the Lamb of God.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.860]   And I'm sure most of you, as was already hinted,
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.360]   will get back after this conference
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.860]   to our small congregations.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:13.360]   We may feel that it is a bit of an anticlimax,
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.360]   but I hope it will be an encouragement to you
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   that soon, and very soon, those few voices,
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.360]   together with others, will not just
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   lift the roof of a building like this,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.860]   but whatever it is that is the canopy over heaven,
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:41.360]   as we join the angels to praise the Lord.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.860]   My message this evening is entitled
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.360]   "Not Ashamed of the Gospel."
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   And you can anticipate that this is from Romans and chapter 1.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   We will primarily be considering verse 16 and verse 17.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   The challenge with preaching from this passage
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.860]   is the fact that we are dealing with, first of all,
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.360]   the Bible itself, which is the greatest piece of writing
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   across the whole of human history.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.860]   And when we come to the book of Romans,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.360]   we are really dealing with that book
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   within this wider book that no doubt stands out
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.860]   in terms of its extraordinary display
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.360]   of the grace of God in salvation
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   And so to come to any section of it
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.860]   and try and expound it,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:57.360]   your heart is filled with a sense of ecstasy
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.360]   because you realize that this is something
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.360]   the whole world needs to hear.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   You are, as it were, reading and holding in your hands
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   that which is the highest message
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   of not only planet Earth, but also of the entire universe.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   No doubt the Apostle Paul knew this,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   and that's the very reason why he was seeking to get to Rome.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.860]   It was his ambition that one day he would stand
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:43.360]   in the capital city of the known world at that time,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.860]   where the greatest powers, potentates,
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.860]   had reigned over the years,
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:58.860]   to go there and to say to all,
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:06.860]   "Behold the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world."
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:12.860]   And therefore, as he opens up this epistle,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:18.860]   he does so already wanting us to know something
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.860]   of this gospel that he longs to preach there.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.360]   Normally when the Apostle Paul is beginning
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.860]   any of his writings, he'll introduce himself,
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.360]   usually in just one sentence.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.860]   Sometimes all he says is, "Paul, Silas, and Timothy,"
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.860]   and then moves on.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.360]   But in this particular case, we have the longest piece
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.860]   of self-introduction.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.860]   And when you read it, it's not really Paul introducing himself.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.860]   It's Paul giving us already something of the summary
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:04.860]   of this gospel that he is not ashamed of.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.360]   He gives, as you read through that introduction
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.860]   from verse 1 to verse 6, first of all,
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.360]   that he's not ashamed of this message
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   because it's the gospel of God.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.860]   Isn't it the way he puts it?
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.860]   Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle,
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.360]   set apart for the gospel of God.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   Now that's not the way Paul normally introduces the gospel.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   He speaks of it as the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.860]   But in this particular case, he wants to make it
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:50.860]   abundantly clear that it is the good news
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:56.360]   of the creator of the universe, the governor of history,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   the redeemer of his people, the coming judge
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   of the living and the dead.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.360]   He goes on to tell us that this message is one
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.860]   that in fact has been promised by this God
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.360]   right across the Old Testament.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   He says which he promised beforehand
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:21.360]   through his prophets in the holy scriptures.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   He tells us who is at the center of this message.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   Concerning his son.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   If you miss that, you've missed the gospel.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.360]   The gospel is not a method about how you
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   and God can come together.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   It is an announcement concerning a redeemer,
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   a savior, one who comes into our circumstances
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   to rescue us from condemnation and all else
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   that God has included in that little phrase,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   the curse of God because of sin.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   Speaking about his son, he quickly tells us
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   two facts concerning this son.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   First of all, his humanity, who was descended
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   from David according to the flesh.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   And then his divinity, and was declared to be
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   the son of God in power according to the spirit
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   of holiness by his resurrection from the dead,
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.360]   As we've already heard, there is no one else
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:47.360]   in the whole of history who can be described this way.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.360]   The God-man.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   Jesus had to be both in order to rescue us
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.360]   from our sin.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   He had to be man because he was taking our place,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   dying our death, drinking in our hell,
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   that we may not go through that process.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   But he also had to be God because if he was
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   a mere man, first of all, he would have only
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   died for one other man, but worse still,
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   he would have sunk deeper than the grave
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   into the flames of hell forever.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   But because he is God, he could pay the price
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   for millions upon millions, billions upon billions,
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.360]   trillions upon trillions of his elect people
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   because the value of his death was infinite.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   The Apostle Paul goes on to say here
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   that it is because of him that we are now
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   proclaimers of this message.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.360]   He's given us that call.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   He puts it this way, "Through whom we have
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   received grace and apostleship to bring about
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.360]   the obedience of faith," and then he says,
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   "For the sake of his name among all the nations."
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.360]   We are speaking here about proclaiming Christ
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   Paul is saying we did not simply volunteer
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   to do this.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   We didn't say to ourselves, "This is a good idea.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   Let's spend the rest of our lives doing this."
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   He's saying this Jesus called us to do this work
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   so that we may be in the front rank
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   of a great army of preachers that will ensure
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.360]   over history to get this message
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   Can anybody be ashamed of such a message
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   in the light of this brief summary
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   that we've just noted here?
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   But then, before we get to our text,
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   the Apostle Paul moves one step further
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   and speaks about his fondness for the people
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.360]   of God who are already gathered,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   saved by grace in Rome.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   He speaks of, first of all, the fact that
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.360]   he thanked God for them.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   I'll read verse 7 to just bridge the gap,
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   but we'll go to verse 8.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   "To all those in Rome who are loved by God
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.360]   and called to be saints,
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   grace to you and peace from God our Father
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   Then he says, "First, I thank my God
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   through Jesus Christ for all of you
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   because your faith is proclaimed
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   in all the world."
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   In other words, there is evidence
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   that this gospel has borne fruit in Rome,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   that lives have been changed,
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   that from being idolaters,
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   individuals have been brought together
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   to become worshippers of the living God.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   And testimony of this has begun to spread
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.360]   in the known world.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   And Paul goes on to say, "Because of this,
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   I pray for you and I long to come there
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   so that I might have fellowship with you
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.360]   so that I may be a blessing to you
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.360]   and you may be a blessing to me."
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   Look at the way he puts it there in verse 9.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   "For God is my witness,
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   asking that somehow, by God's will,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.360]   For I long to see you,
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   that I may impart to you some spiritual gift
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   to strengthen you,
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   that is, that we may be mutually encouraged
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   by each other's faith, both yours and mine."
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   It is after that, that Paul then
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.360]   really gets back to this gospel
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   and speaks in terms of why he wants to get to Rome.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   And it is this, that I want to win souls in Rome.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   God, by his grace, has enabled me to preach
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   around other parts of the world, in Asia,
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   all the way into Macedonia and Achaia,
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   but I cannot wait to bring this same message
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   to the capital city of the world,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   that I may win souls there.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.360]   I love the way in which he puts it.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   Listen to this, verse 13 down to verse 15.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   He says, "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   that I have often intended to come to you,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   but thus far have been prevented,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   in order that I may reap some harvest among you,
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   as well as among the rest of the Gentiles."
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   Paul there is speaking about an intention
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   that remained unfulfilled.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   There are many times that he preached
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   in different parts of the world,
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.360]   especially, as I said, Asia and Europe,
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:22.360]   and he saw it as virgin territory.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   He knew that Rome had already received the gospel,
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   and he did not want to build on other people's foundation.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   And therefore, for a while, he continued laboring elsewhere.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   He puts it that way in the penultimate chapter
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.360]   of the book of Romans, so Romans chapter 15.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   This is the way he puts it there, Romans 15.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   I begin reading from verse 18.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   He says, "For I will not venture to speak of anything
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.360]   except what Christ has accomplished through me,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   to bring the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.360]   by the power of signs and wonders,
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   by the power of the Spirit of God,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:18.360]   so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum,
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ,
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel,
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.360]   not where Christ has already been named,
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.360]   lest I build on someone else's foundation.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.360]   But as it is written, those who've never been told of him
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   will see, and those who've never heard will understand."
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.360]   Verse 22, "For this reason," rather,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.360]   "this is the reason why I have so often been hindered
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   from coming to you.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.360]   It's because I have had so many other areas
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.360]   where I know Christ is not known,
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   and I want to proclaim him there."
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   So he says in verse 23, "But now,
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   since I no longer have any room for work in these regions,
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   and since I have longed for many years to come to you,
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:22.360]   I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain."
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   So that's Paul.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   And he says, "As I come into Rome,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   I sense this obligation to preach to all and sundry."
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.360]   Greeks, verse 14, back to chapter 1,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.360]   and barbarians, wise and foolish,
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   "I'm eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome."
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   That brings us to the text.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   What is it about this gospel that makes Paul
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:19.360]   to want to go into the seat of political power
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   and declare it?
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   What is it?
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   Well, essentially, it is something that all of us in here
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:36.360]   who are preachers should be able to attest to.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   We should, as individuals, sense the throbbing
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   of the apostle Paul's heart as he speaks or writes down,
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   pens down, Romans chapter 1, verse 16 and 17.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   As you are sitting there, you should be able to say,
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.360]   "Yes, yes, that's me!"
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   And may God help all of us to have that testimony
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   in our hearts.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   And number one, it is the fact that the gospel
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:17.360]   is the power of God to serve.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.360]   Look at the way he puts it here.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   He says, "For I'm not ashamed of the gospel,"
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.360]   and by that, all he means is, "I'm proud of the gospel."
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   This is the one message that I boast about
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   compared to anything else in this life.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   I glory in the gospel.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   And the reason he gives is that it is the power of God
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.360]   for salvation.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.360]   In other words, think about it for a moment,
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   if I can borrow your imagination,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   that the God who has made this entire earth
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   with all its complexity
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   and enabled it to hang on nothing,
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.360]   the God who has made the various planets
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   that revolve around the sun
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   in uniformity and beauty and symmetry
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   so that none of these planets hits against the other
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   with all the moons that might be going around
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   the planets that have those moons,
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.360]   the God who has made this solar system
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   to be part of other solar systems
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   to form this glorious galaxy
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.360]   that we refer to as the Milky Way,
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   the God who has made this galaxy
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   to be but a dot on the canvas of the universe
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   because there are so many other galaxies,
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   the God who is above all of that creation,
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:46.360]   the power that holds all that together.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   It is his power to give life to a dead soul
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   through this gospel.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.360]   Wow.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   If you had that message in your hands,
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   with that amount of power,
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   would you not boast about it?
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   Would you not glory in it?
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.360]   And he's not just saying it here.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.360]   If we go to 1 Corinthians 1,
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   that's basically what he talks about even there
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.360]   when the Corinthians were fighting with each other
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.360]   over who among the leaders that had preached in Corinth
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   was the greatest.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   The Apostle Paul is saying, "You guys have gone mad."
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:13.360]   Because human beings cannot give life to the dead.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   You are fighting over nothings.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   The one who matters above all
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:28.360]   and is the only one who matters is God
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   because of his power.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   Look at the way he puts it in verse 18
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   of 1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   but to us who are being saved, there it is.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   It is the power of God."
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   This word of the cross, the logos,
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   the logic of Calvary that we proclaim.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   It's good news.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   It is the very power of this infinite God.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   He then challenges those that have tried
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   to be saviors of the world.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   He says, "For it is written,
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.'"
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   Where is the one who is wise?
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   Where is the scribe?
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   The point he's making there is that generally speaking
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:33.360]   within Roman culture and Greek culture,
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   the orators with their philosophies of utopia
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   were what the people gloried in.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   And he is saying, "Bring them out.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   Let us see what they have achieved."
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   That's what he means by, "Where are they?"
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.360]   He's not looking for them in the hedges and bushes.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   He's saying, "Let them bring their achievement.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.360]   Let them bring it."
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.360]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   whatever philosophies they came up with
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   has proven to be utter failure
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   because of God's design.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   "For since in the wisdom of God
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.360]   the world did not know God through wisdom,
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.360]   it pleased God through the folly of what we preach,"
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.360]   this same gospel, "to save those who believe."
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   Jews are demanding signs.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   Greeks are seeking wisdom.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   But we preach Christ crucifying.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   A stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, yes.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   But listen to this.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks,
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   Christ, there it is, the power of God.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   Christ, the wisdom of God.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   "For the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   You see, one reason why Paul could say this
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   is because he once experienced this power.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:43.360]   He was a proud and arrogant man.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.360]   He was full of self-righteousness.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   He had a zeal for God as he knew God
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   that made him persecute the people of the way,
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.360]   Christians essentially.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   He chased after them from Jerusalem,
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.360]   heading out to Damascus.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   As far as he was concerned,
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   he had this driving passion
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   to bring this sect to nothing.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:36.360]   And then Jesus Christ made him.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   That arrogant, proud individual
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   was brought to his knees.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:50.360]   His world, his ambition came crashing down,
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   broken into small pieces at his feet
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   when Jesus said to him,
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting."
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:09.360]   And from there, all that he had known of the Old Testament,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.360]   God, by His Spirit, opened his eyes.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   He began to see that this Jesus
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.360]   was in actual fact the fulfillment
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   of all the promises that were there
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   that he was seeking to live by.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.360]   And that in fact, he needed to throw away
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.360]   any effort at self-righteousness
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.360]   to the point where Paul called it "dung,"
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   "refuse,"
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   so that he can only embrace Christ
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   and Christ alone.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   Jesus, at that point,
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   destroyed that arrogance
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   and turned him into an individual
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.360]   who was loving, loving God
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.360]   and loving the people of God,
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:13.360]   an individual who only wanted to live for God alone.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   What brought about that transformation?
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.360]   The power of God.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:29.360]   And hence, he wanted others to experience that power.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   Brethren, you are here
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.360]   and you call yourself a preacher.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.360]   Let me ask,
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:53.360]   have you experienced God's converting power?
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   Can you say in the words of one of the songs
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   that at least we sing back home?
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.360]   Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful day.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.360]   Day I will never forget.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   After I had wandered in darkness away,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   Jesus, my Savior, I met.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   Oh, what a tender, compassionate friend.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   He made the need of my heart.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   Shadows dispelling,
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   with joy I am telling,
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   he made all the darkness depart.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.360]   Heaven came down
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   and glory, glory filled my soul.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:45.360]   When at the cross, the Savior made me whole.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   My sins he washed away.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.360]   My night he turned to day.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.360]   Has Jesus done that to you?
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.360]   Has he?
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.360]   Because brethren, you cannot give what you haven't received.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   You can't.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   If all you have is cerebral information,
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:27.360]   that has not given life to the dead,
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   put light where there was darkness,
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   broken the chains of the slave and made you free.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:46.360]   I'm not surprised that you are ashamed of the gospel.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.360]   I'm not.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   But if that power has transformed you,
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   how can you be ashamed of the gospel?
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   How?
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   Paul is saying in our text
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:11.360]   that I'm not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.360]   it is the power of God for salvation
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.360]   to everyone who believes.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.360]   To everyone who believes.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   And he says to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   In other words, it doesn't matter who you are.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:40.360]   This power of God serves indiscriminately.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.360]   That's why earlier he's speaking about Greeks and Barbarians,
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   wise and foolish.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.360]   He's saying it doesn't matter.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   It might be the self-righteous
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:57.360]   who've been in the Christian circles since birth,
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   and therefore they have been building
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.360]   a tower of self-righteousness,
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.360]   hoping one day they can somehow reach God.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:13.360]   That gospel sweeps all that away
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   and brings them embracing Christ and Christ alone.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   It may be someone on the opposite extreme
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:27.360]   who has literally lived their lives
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   in the gutters of life,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   in sexual immorality and drunkenness and drug addiction.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:47.360]   That same power is able to clean them up
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:54.360]   and enable them to be proclaimers of this same message.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:58.360]   Now, why is that so?
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:07.360]   Why is this gospel the means by which a righteous God,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   a thrice holy God,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:19.360]   a God who by very nature hates sin absolutely
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:27.360]   and must inevitably punish sin,
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:37.360]   why should He instead act in terms of His power,
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360]   instead of that power destroying,
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   that power lifting us out of that storm of sin and death?
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Why?
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.360]   Well, the apostle Paul answers that question in verse 17,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   and his answer is this.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   "For in it," which is in the gospel,
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.360]   "the righteousness of God is revealed from faith
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   "for faith, as it is written,
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.360]   "the righteous shall live by faith."
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.360]   The point he's making is this,
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.360]   that in this message of salvation, the gospel,
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   there is a gift that God gives us as human beings,
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.360]   a gift that is completely free,
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.360]   a gift that is given by grace,
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:48.360]   and it is that of a righteousness
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.360]   that can enable us to stand before God now
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.360]   and even more so to stand before God
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   when His wrath is poured out against sinners
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   on the final judgment day.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.360]   And it is His own righteousness,
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   the righteousness of God,
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   the righteousness of God's own Son.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.360]   And that's where the difference comes in,
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:29.360]   because instead of this God dealing with us
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   as our sins deserve,
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:38.360]   this God deals with us according to a righteousness
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   that was procured by another
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   and is now put to our account.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   Let me put it this way.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   The Christian faith is not just about forgiveness.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.360]   Now, it is about forgiveness.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.360]   That's important.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   It is about righteousness being credited to our account.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.360]   So we are not simply individuals
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.360]   who were in the red, in the negative,
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.360]   and God brings us to zero
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.360]   and then says, "Now, I'm warning you.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.360]   Just make sure you don't go back into that red.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.360]   Just make sure."
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.360]   No, He does much more than that.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.360]   Through the death of His Son,
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.360]   He brings us from that negative to the zero.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.360]   But through the righteousness of His Son,
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.360]   He takes us from that zero into the positive,
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   the glorious positive,
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.360]   the positive of God Himself,
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.360]   the righteousness of God.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:20.360]   Wow.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.360]   What a gift.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.360]   And that's what Paul speaks about here
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   and elsewhere in this epistle.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.360]   He says, "For in it, the righteousness of God
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.360]   is revealed from faith to faith."
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.360]   Now, most of you will know the story of Martin Luther,
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.360]   that at first when he would read this account
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   and also Romans 3,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   referring to the righteousness of God,
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.360]   he was thinking in terms of the justice of God.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.360]   And inevitably, therefore, he was running away from God
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.360]   because he was seeing this God
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   who in His justice wants to punish him.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.360]   Until one day, the coin clicked.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:16.360]   And he realized that this is God's righteousness
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:24.360]   given freely to those who come to God in faith.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:31.360]   It completely changed Martin Luther.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   He puts it this way in chapter 3,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   and I'll begin from verse 23.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.360]   "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.360]   So all, there's no exception.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360]   Doesn't matter how religious you may have been,
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.360]   we have all failed the test.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.360]   We all deserve to go to hell.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:01.360]   But we are justified by His grace as a gift.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   Now, there's a lot of tautology there
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.360]   because once you say by His grace,
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.360]   grace is always a gift.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   But Paul wants to really drum this matter home
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   that we may realize that it's free, it's free, it's free!
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.360]   By adding "as a gift."
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   And then he puts it this,
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.360]   "Through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,"
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   I'll come to that in a moment,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.360]   "whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   to be received by faith."
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.360]   This was to show God's righteousness.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.360]   In other words, this God who does not overlook sin,
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:04.360]   but deals with it in the person of His Son.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360]   Brethren, let me quickly rush there
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:13.360]   because that's where it matters the most.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   We were singing earlier,
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.360]   "When I survey the wondrous cross
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:23.360]   on which the Prince of Glory died,
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   my richest gain I count but loss,
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.360]   and I pour contempt on all my pride."
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   Why?
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.360]   Because when I gaze at that cross
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   and I hear the cry of the great good man,
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.360]   Jesus Christ, my God, my God,
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   why have you forsaken me?
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   And I realize that He who was the uncreated one,
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.360]   the second person of the Trinity,
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:14.360]   God Himself,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   who at the click of His finger
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   can reproduce the whole of humanity,
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.360]   that He descended from that throne,
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   the rainbow-sacred throne,
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:38.360]   was just like a wild animal on planet Earth,
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:45.360]   and willingly, willingly took my place,
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.360]   suffered my punishment,
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.360]   that God the Father
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   should have poured upon His own Son
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.360]   His wrath to its very dregs,
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.360]   that my Savior hung there
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.360]   because He loved me.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   He loved me.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   Everything about me would have been disgusting to Him,
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:23.360]   but He loved me.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   How can I even bring in an iota of pride?
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   All I can do is to say, "Thank you.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   Thank you."
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   As I hear that cry of dereliction,
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   my God, my God,
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.360]   why have you forsaken me?
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:58.360]   I know that the answer is love,
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.360]   infinite love
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.360]   that displays who I am,
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   the God of mercy,
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.360]   the God of love,
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   the God of grace,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:21.360]   the God who is good.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.360]   Let me say it again.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   How can you be ashamed of that message?
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360]   How?
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   How?
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   You will want the world to know
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:45.360]   about the lover of your soul
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   who has loved you with everlasting love.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   You will want to tell the universe about it,
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.360]   as Paul himself would
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.360]   when he speaks about the fact that the Old Testament
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   spoke about this
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.360]   when he says, "For it is written,
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   'The righteous shall live by faith.'"
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   The point he's making there is that
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   this is a gift we only receive.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.360]   That's all.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   We don't add anything to it.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:34.360]   We just receive it.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.360]   In fact, the phrase there which translators have really struggled with
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   when he says, "The righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith,"
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   the point there is it is an alloyed faith.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   It's a faith without mixture of works.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   It's all free that you simply receive.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.360]   Surely, that should humble us.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.360]   It's only the worst of the worst of sinners
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:14.360]   who would want to bring in pride in that text.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.360]   It's like a proud, proud father
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   who in the midst of a war-torn situation
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   where they have no access to work
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.360]   and therefore they cannot bring any food home
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.360]   hears about the fact that perhaps the United Nations
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.360]   or some relief organization has flown in
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   and they've brought in bags of rice or potatoes
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   or whatever else might be food
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.360]   and then as it is brought in
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:58.360]   the father goes there with a bucket
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   and an hour later arrives home
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   strutting like a peacock
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.360]   and the little child says, "Dad,
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   you seem to be very proud.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   What is it?"
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   And he says, "Look at what I've brought.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   Am I not a great dad?"
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   "Well, dad, how did you get this?"
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360]   That's quite humbling,
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.360]   but he has to try and show that he did something.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:45.360]   And he says, "Well, I held out this empty bucket
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.360]   and here is the rice.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   Am I not a great dad?"
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.360]   Come on.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   At the most you are a begging dad.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.360]   The one who gave is the one we should praise.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.360]   Friends, you cannot boast about faith
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.360]   because faith is simply you reaching out
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.360]   as a beggar
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:21.360]   that he might give you his gift.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.360]   And that's what he has done for us.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.360]   Let me hurry on to close, therefore.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.360]   Here is a perfect sacrifice
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.360]   with a perfect gift
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.360]   from a perfect God
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360]   that is given to us.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.360]   Surely, brethren, we of all people
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   should want to proclaim this gospel to all.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   We should feel moved
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.360]   to go to lands where Christ is not known
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.360]   and be willing to pay with our very lives
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:02.360]   that men and women might come to know our Savior,
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.360]   the Lord Jesus Christ, this great God,
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.360]   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.360]   That we may say to them,
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   "This is not about trying.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   It's about trusting."
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   God has done it all
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.360]   in the person of his Son.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   We should say to them,
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:30.360]   "There is a full and free righteousness for you.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   Come just as you are
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.360]   and experience this full and free salvation
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.360]   in the person of God's own Son.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.360]   You don't need to go back and try and clean up anything.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   No, no, no, no.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360]   As you are right now.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360]   For that's the way I came.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.360]   I came as a beggar
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.360]   and he poured upon me
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.360]   grace upon grace upon grace.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.360]   He can do the same for you.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   Come just as you are."
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   Oh brethren,
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   I pray that those of us here
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360]   who are preachers
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   can once again have the gospel of God
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.360]   burn in our souls
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.360]   to the point where that's what we want to do
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.360]   in the midst of so many other responsibilities
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   of pastoring and so on.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   All that we may say,
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   "Please get these things away.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.360]   Let others do it,
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:37.360]   but give me the pulpit."
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   I want to preach
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.360]   the glorious message
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   of this great God and Savior,
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   Jesus Christ.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:56.360]   Oh, as the great hymn writer Charles Wesley put it,
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.360]   "His only righteousness I show.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   His saving faith proclaim.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.360]   His saving truth proclaim.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.360]   It is all my business here below
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.360]   to cry, 'Behold the Lamb.'
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   Oh, that in my latest breath
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:24.360]   I might but gasp His name
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   and cry to all in that final breath,
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   'Behold, behold the Lamb.'"
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.360]   Let's pray.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   Great God of heaven,
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.360]   thank you for this message,
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.360]   the message of the cross.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:01.360]   Thank you for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:11.360]   Thank you for Christ Himself.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   Lord,
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   thank you
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   that you've called us.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.360]   Thank you, Lord,
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.360]   that you've called us
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.360]   to be proclaimers
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.360]   of this message.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   Lord, who are we?
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:56.360]   Thank you
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   that you should bestow such an honor
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:07.360]   that we should be ambassadors
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.360]   for King Jesus.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.360]   Lord, thank you.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.360]   Amen.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:30.360]   [applause]
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.360]   Pastor Conrad,
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.360]   that's very hard to say anything after that.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   Thank you for the beauty.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.360]   It reminds me of the hymn
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.360]   that you quoted earlier.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   "Oh, what a wonderful day
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   it has been for us."
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.360]   Thank you, Pastor.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.360]   Thank you.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   Well, I want you to take a moment
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.360]   just to let this settle in,
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.360]   everything that's taken place today,
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360]   the messages we've just heard.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.360]   But as you're starting to think about
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.360]   what's next tonight,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.360]   if you would do
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.360]   just a housekeeping favor for us,
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360]   and that is if you would make sure
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360]   to take all of your belongings
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360]   with you tonight.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360]   I have a few things to say,
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   but take your belongings with you.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360]   If you could, please clean up
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.360]   the trash around you.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   That would be so helpful for us.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.360]   We have a TMS alumni
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   who have RSVP'd,
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.360]   are going to have a special reception
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   this evening on the second floor
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   of the Tower Building,
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   which is the building
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.360]   with the stairs on the outside.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   Tomorrow's first session
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360]   begins at 9 a.m.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.360]   with H.B. Charles, Jr.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.360]   For those who are interested also
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360]   that want to set up
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:47.360]   a Fundamentals of Security meeting,
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360]   we're going to have it
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360]   with our security team
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   for your local church.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360]   You can attend tomorrow morning's
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   security seminar
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360]   in the third floor
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   of the Tower Building,
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.360]   room T370 at 7 a.m.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.360]   Just remember, the night is not over,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   so please fellowship,
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.360]   enjoy one another's company,
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360]   but also remember,
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.360]   if you parked in the south parking lot,
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.360]   your vehicle needs to be out
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.360]   by 9 p.m., all right?
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   Now to Him who is able
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   to keep you from stumbling
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   and to make you stand
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   in the presence of His glory,
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   blameless with great joy,
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   to the only God, our Savior,
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.360]   through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.360]   be glory, majesty, might,
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.360]   and authority before all time
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   and now and forever.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   Amen.
