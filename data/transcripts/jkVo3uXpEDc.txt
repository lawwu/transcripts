[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - And we are back, good Monday morning.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   We enter this new week with a great topic on the table.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.600]   I mentioned it on Friday.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600]   I love episodes where we just walk through several texts
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.300]   that have proved most helpful to you
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.060]   over the decades, Pastor John.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.080]   And we're doing that today,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.220]   prompted by this question from a listener named Greg.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.360]   Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.120]   I'm so thankful for Desiring God and for you
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.020]   and for this podcast.
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.760]   Here is my question.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.980]   What are your favorite verses
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.600]   for when you fight the enemy the hardest?
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.920]   What are your go-to verses?
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.720]   I love it when the verses are just there for us,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.520]   but we also have to go looking for them also at times.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.560]   So Pastor John, what text would you give Greg
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.180]   and to all of us?
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.000]   - Well, the first thing is thank you very much.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.080]   There's nothing I'd rather do
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.000]   than go looking for my favorite verses
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.780]   because I need rehearsal just like everybody else does.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.880]   And so just giving some thought to this
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.800]   was simply wonderful.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.540]   It's wonderful not only because I enjoy so much,
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.140]   but also because I think this is just big,
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.020]   good for our listeners.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.160]   I hope they tune in now for the next 10 minutes or so
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160]   and just soak in the glorious parts of scripture
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.020]   that are so wonderfully tailor-made
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.340]   for living the Christian life
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.280]   through all of its ups and downs.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.340]   I don't think God wants us to live our lives
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.520]   in a kind of vague sense of trust.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.800]   Like God is good, vaguely.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.780]   I have trust, vaguely.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.480]   I enter my day, vaguely.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   I think he wants us to have specific promises.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.600]   Now, since there are hundreds of them in the Bible,
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.180]   you have to make choices about which one you're gonna use
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.520]   like a lozenge in your mouth today.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.440]   Like I picture my heart as a mouth with a tongue
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.760]   and I put a lozenge in it of some juicy promise
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.120]   and I suck on it all day long.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.240]   And that means I don't suck on 50 others
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.360]   'cause my brain at least will not hold 50 things
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   in consciousness at one time.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.840]   So here are some of my most common go-to lozenges
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   or passages that I find help in
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.320]   through all kinds of situations.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.920]   And I'm gonna just pose a question
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.040]   about a situation that I face
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.760]   and then give you the go-to promises.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.360]   Number one, I think I might have 11 of these,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   so I'll try to go quick.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.400]   Number one, I'll start with lust, the sin of lust.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.280]   So here I am searching Google or I'm on some news site
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700]   and there's this sexually titillating link,
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.140]   not to pornography, that's really not a big temptation
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.760]   for me, I've never been to a pornographic site,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   but just this sexually titillating picture over here
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   that you can go and see more of what that might be about.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.800]   Will you click through?
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   And here are my three go-to passages
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.940]   that persuade me, don't do that.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.080]   That's not going to be good for you.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.780]   One is a warning, which is a negative promise,
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.180]   one is a positive promise and one is a provision.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.480]   So first, the warning.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.320]   If your right eye causes you to sin,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.900]   tear it out and throw it away,
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.200]   for it's better for you to lose one of your members
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.440]   than for your whole body to go into hell.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.600]   I'll tell you, that's a very powerful disincentive
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.840]   from clicking through to sexually titillating stuff.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.320]   And then there's this positive promise,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.280]   and this is even more powerful.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.300]   Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.600]   I want to see God.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   And I know if I linger over some presumably innocent
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.520]   sexual stimulation, the defilement of my mind
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   will obscure the sight of the living God.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.660]   I know it will.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.000]   And then the third thing is the provision.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.600]   He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   And I say to myself, Christ suffered horribly on the cross
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.360]   so that I would not click on sexually stimulating material
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.460]   and I don't want to hammer another nail into his hand.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.280]   Number two, I am facing some affliction, say.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.600]   It's sickness, maybe small, maybe big, or some loss.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.520]   And oh, how precious has Psalm 34, 19 been to me.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.700]   Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.960]   but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.120]   Now, the reason that's especially encouraging
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.720]   is because it says that the righteous are in affliction.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.840]   In other words, it's not necessarily owing to my sin
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.880]   that I'm in this affliction.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.080]   And it says I'm coming out in God's good time.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.240]   Number three, revenge.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.520]   Anger at the way I've been mistreated by somebody.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.480]   Somebody said something false about me.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.400]   How can I have peace while injustice against me
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.800]   has been done?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.100]   Answer, the promise that God will be the avenger.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.040]   John Piper, love your enemies.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.740]   You do not need to get the last word here.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.260]   God will settle things in due time.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.400]   So here's Romans 12, 19.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.160]   Beloved, never avenge yourselves.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.840]   Leave it to the wrath of God,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.880]   for it is written, "Vengeance is mine.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.200]   I will repay."
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.840]   That's a promise.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.360]   I will repay, says the Lord.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.420]   To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry,
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.520]   you feed him, John Piper.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.300]   Leave the repayment to God.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.240]   Oh, how many times I have been set free
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.680]   from bitterness that way.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.640]   Number four, I feel weak.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   I feel inadequate.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.760]   I'm facing a situation and I'm just not up to it.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.640]   Isaiah 64, four.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.200]   From of old, no one has heard or perceived by the ear.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.640]   No eye has seen a God besides you.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   Well, what's so unique about him?
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.840]   Here's what it says.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.080]   Who works for those who wait for him.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.600]   That's absolutely amazing.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.320]   Glorious, the glorious uniqueness of our God
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.120]   is that he works for us instead of recruiting slave labor
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.480]   to work for him.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.320]   Amazing.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.020]   And listen to how 2 Chronicles 16, nine says it.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.960]   The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.920]   the whole earth to show himself strong
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.560]   for those whose heart is whole toward him.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.400]   God is looking for people for whom with omnipotence
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   he can work today.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.320]   Can I work for you today?
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.520]   Like I'll sign up God to work for me today.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.680]   So I wanna be strong for you today.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.760]   Will you trust me?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.720]   I'll tell you, that's amazing.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.640]   Number five, what about when I don't have
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.300]   what I think I need?
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.520]   Enough money, enough time, enough help.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   What if I lead a ministry and they look to me for hope?
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   Now there are two go-to verses I've used hundreds of times.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   Philippians 4, 19, my God will supply every need of yours
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.880]   according to his riches and glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.960]   That's mind blowing.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.360]   Both the promise and the resources are mind blowing.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   The riches of glory is how much he has
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.740]   with which to help me.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.520]   Every need will be met.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.920]   How many times did I say to our leaders at Bethlehem
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.840]   while I was a pastor coming to the end of a year
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.000]   with finances almost always falling short,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.360]   and I say to them, guys,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.920]   God will give us everything we need.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.840]   He will, it says so, period.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.600]   Let's go home and sleep.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.620]   And then there's Hebrews 13, five and six.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.400]   Keep your life free from the love of money.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.480]   Be content with what you have.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.440]   He has said, I will never leave you.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.400]   I will never forsake you.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.680]   So we can confidently say, the Lord is my helper.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.200]   I will not fear what can man do to me.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.360]   I mean, that's as sweet as it gets.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.300]   Number six, does he care?
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.800]   You come into moments where you say,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.160]   yeah, I know all the big promises.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.660]   He's powerful, he's wise, but does he care?
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.060]   Does he care about me personally?
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.300]   I'm such a little teeny weeny weeny,
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.840]   little human being in the universe is big.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.320]   How could God possibly care for me?
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.280]   First Peter, five, seven.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.680]   Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.360]   Yes, yes, of course, we know that.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.320]   That's our theology.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.540]   So that at the proper time, he may exalt you,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.680]   casting all your anxieties on him
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.920]   because he cares for you.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.240]   I've said that little phrase, walking into situations.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.280]   So many times, he cares for you.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.800]   He cares for you.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.040]   He's God and he cares for you.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.540]   So there is a mighty hand and there is a caring heart.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.840]   So he says, don't shrink back from humility,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.940]   thinking that you're gonna be too vulnerable
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.600]   if you're humble, but rather remind yourself,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.100]   no, every single anxiety goes onto his broad shoulders
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   because he cares, he cares for you.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.800]   Number seven, how much does he care?
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.760]   Like, is this a mild care?
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   Is this kind of a begrudging care?
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.620]   Yeah, God's a God of love and therefore Jesus died,
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.920]   so he has to care for me.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.880]   Oh my goodness, how horrible can our minds talk to us?
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.160]   How much does he care?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   Luke 12, 32.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.080]   Fear not, little flock.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   It is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.800]   It's his good pleasure.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.560]   He loves to care for you.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.720]   Or better than this is Jeremiah 32, 41.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.120]   This is God talking.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.680]   I will rejoice in doing good to them
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:38.040]   with all my heart and with all my soul.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.040]   I mean, what more can God say than that he loves,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.600]   he rejoices to do good to us with all his heart
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.240]   and all his soul?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.720]   I mean, there isn't anything conceivably bigger
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.320]   than all of God's heart and all of God's soul,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.060]   and that's what he says is behind his doing good for us.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.760]   Number eight, will he help me in this crisis
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   that I am feeling very afraid in right now?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.200]   This is probably the verse that I have gone to, Tony,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   more than any other verse in all my 76 years of life.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.040]   And I'll bet lots of people who've listened over the years
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.680]   would already know what verse it is.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.320]   It's Isaiah 41, 10.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.520]   Fear not, for I am with you.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.600]   Be not dismayed.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.160]   I am your God.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.320]   I will strengthen you.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   I will help you.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.000]   I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.160]   The reason that is number one
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:01.040]   for the struggle with fear, which is almost every day,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.060]   something fearful happens every day,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.720]   little fears, big fears, is because it's not general.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   It's the voice of God himself speaking with a direct,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.040]   I will, I will, I will.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   Spurgeon said, "I love the I wills and I shalls of God."
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.120]   Me too, me too.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.480]   I mean, they are, I mean, the he wills,
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.680]   the he wills, he will help you, those are good.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.000]   But I will, I mean, when I step into the pulpit
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   anxious that God act in spite of my inadequacies,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.760]   and I hear him say, because I'm preaching it to myself,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.080]   by his authority from his word, I will help you.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.200]   I mean, that's just glorious,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   because you actually hear God by his word say it to you.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.560]   Number nine, what about depression?
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.840]   What about melancholy?
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.000]   Times of deep, deep discouragement, countless times.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.560]   We used to have a sign on the side of the building
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.400]   because I quoted this so often back in the days
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.600]   when people thought, "That's the Hope in God church
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.000]   because of the sign, there it is on the side of the wall."
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.240]   Why'd they put that up there?
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.960]   They put it up there because they have a depressed pastor
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.360]   who needs encouragement as he walks to church.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.600]   Here's what I go to, "Why are you downcast, O my soul?"
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.000]   You're preaching to yourself, right?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.640]   John Piper's preaching to himself.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.320]   "Why are you downcast, O my soul?
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.040]   And why are you in turmoil within me, hoping God,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.240]   for I shall again praise him, my help and my God."
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.160]   Oh my goodness, I have preached that to myself
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.320]   in low times, hundreds and hundreds of times.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.720]   Number 10, we're almost done, just two more quick ones.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.840]   Death, okay, I'm old, right?
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.020]   76 is old, I think I just read,
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.680]   somebody died yesterday at 76.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.560]   Every time I read that or 74 or 63 or 42,
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.720]   I say, "Wow, I'm living on borrowed time."
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.040]   Could be any night, right?
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.160]   So what do you say to yourself
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.000]   when that fact overwhelms you?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.020]   And here is, I mean, for months,
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.160]   I have recited this to myself
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.440]   before I go to sleep every night.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.120]   Maybe one or two exceptions.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.400]   First Thessalonians 5, 9,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.260]   "God has not destined you, John Piper, for wrath,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:33.200]   but to obtain salvation through your Lord, Jesus Christ,
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.760]   who died for you, so that whether you wake or sleep,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.440]   you will live with him."
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.520]   Tony, that's going on to my gravestone,
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.760]   unless I change my mind.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.960]   Number 11, the last one.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.640]   And this, I've saved for last
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.440]   because it's the all-encompassing,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.720]   in other words, it provides both foundation
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.580]   for all the promises,
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.420]   and it is the Vesuvius of all the promises,
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.220]   explosion, and you probably know what it is.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.220]   Romans 8, 32, "He who did not spare his own son,"
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.540]   think of it, "but gave him up for us all,
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.860]   how will he not also with him
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.300]   graciously give us all things?"
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.620]   In other words, because Christ died for us,
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.020]   God will give his children everything,
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.720]   absolutely everything we need to be supremely holy
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.780]   and happy forever.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.220]   So thank you, Greg, for the question.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.940]   May the Lord grant to all of us the faith
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.260]   to live joyfully, boldly, lovingly
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.300]   by these amazing treasures.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.900]   - Yeah, Greg, that was a great lead-in
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.940]   to this wonderful episode.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.140]   Thank you for instigating it,
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.340]   and thank you for joining us today.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.780]   You can ask a question of your own like Greg did,
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.340]   search our growing archive,
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.860]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.140]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.100]   Well, next time we look at God's love to us,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.340]   and we are gonna look at his love to us
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.700]   even when life hurts.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.580]   This is one of those areas
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.340]   that proves especially challenging for us to grasp
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.620]   because it's relatively easy to see and feel God's love
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.860]   to us when things are going well in life.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.660]   But what about when sickness hits?
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.780]   What about when we come to the end of our resources?
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.820]   Even as we approach the end of life,
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.700]   how do we feel God's love and his purposes in our pain?
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.540]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.260]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.580]   for that answer from John chapter 11.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.540]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.700]   (upbeat music)
