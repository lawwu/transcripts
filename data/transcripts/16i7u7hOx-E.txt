[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380]   What are some of the things that you feel like you stand for that publicly you get backlash from that you continue to, like, stand 10 toes on?
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.580]   Obviously my faith.
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.880]   Also, like, I was standing up for, you know, children's sex trafficking.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.960]   I mean, I've always been a big advocate on just, like, stopping it and, you know, really caring for those kids because it happens all across the world and not a lot of people talk about it.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.900]   So that's another thing.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.380]   That is one of the most under-talked-about crimes.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.480]   Like, there's 800,000 or some crazy stat of children that go missing a year.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.560]   Where are they really going?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.740]   Who's spending that money?
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.940]   Who is the ones keeping this under wraps?
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.640]   Like, it's such an under-talked-about thing, and that's for a reason.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.400]   It's a hard conversation, which I get it.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.520]   It's a hard conversation.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.020]   I get it.
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.660]   Like, it makes people...
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.380]   But it's reality.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.840]   It's reality.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.780]   It's really happening, and it's really happening to real kids, happening to real families.
