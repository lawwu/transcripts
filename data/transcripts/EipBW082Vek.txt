[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   I would remind you that we are still considering verses 6 to 10 in the second chapter of Paul's
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.280]   epistle to the Romans. Let me therefore read them again that we may remember exactly what
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.440]   is stated here. "Who will render to every man according to his deeds, to them who by
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.920]   but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.480]   indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of men that doeth evil, of
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.760]   the Jew first and also of the Gentile; but glory, honor, and peace to every man that
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.080]   worketh good, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile."
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:01.680]   Now in looking at that last Friday, we spent our time in just considering the actual terms
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.880]   which the apostle uses. It's his fourth argument with these Jews in particular who are not
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920]   clear about this doctrine of the wrath of God and about justification by faith. And
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.360]   the principle he is establishing is the one which he lays down in verse 6, that God will
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   render to every man according to his works. Then we considered how that divides mankind
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.720]   into two groups according to their works. And we have considered what he says in detail
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.040]   about the character, the nature of these two types of works, and therefore the corresponding
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.720]   destinies which are pronounced upon the two groups according to their works.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.520]   Now then, having done that, we proceed, as I indicated we would last Friday, to consider
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.480]   the doctrine which is involved here. And it is a very important point. It's an important
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   point because it's one that has so frequently been misunderstood by people. What exactly
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.560]   is the apostle teaching here? His categorical statement is that God will render to every
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.080]   man according to his works. Very well then, the question that at once arises is this.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:38.680]   Is this clear teaching of justification by works? Is he teaching here that we are saved
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.320]   by what we do, by our actions? Now that is what many, alas, have been tempted to say
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.440]   and have actually said and taught. They say, here it is, it's no use arguing, the statement
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.840]   is perfectly plain in verse 6, who will render to every man according to his works. Now they
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   say, you can't get around that, you can't argue with that, anything you may say about
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.320]   that is what you say. There is the scripture, and you must take the scripture as it is and
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   accept it, whatever may happen to your views and to your theology.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:23.040]   Very well, what do we say about that? Well, this is, as I say, an important matter from
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.800]   the mere standpoint of exposition of scripture, a matter of importance for all of us as we
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.840]   come to read our scriptures. And of course what we can say at once is this, that that
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   suggestion is totally and completely impossible, and for this reason, that what the apostle
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:53.640]   is really doing in this very section is to prove that no man can be justified by works.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.680]   In other words, you will remember he starts at the 18th verse, in the first chapter, he
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.000]   says, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.640]   of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness." And you may recall that we indicated that from
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:25.160]   that point, verse 18 in the first chapter, to verse 20 in the third chapter, the apostle
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   is really dealing with one big point only. It is an elaboration of that 18th verse in
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.560]   the first chapter. And you see, he uttered that, you remember, because it followed of
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.840]   necessity from what he'd been saying in verses 16 and 17 of the first chapter, which was
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.520]   this, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.320]   to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For therein, in this
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.880]   gospel, is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.920]   just shall live by faith.'" Now then, he says, does anybody question or query that?
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:19.440]   Well, he says, "For the wrath of God is revealed, has already been revealed, from heaven against
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.320]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness." And
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.000]   then he proceeds to prove that. That's what he's been proving in the second half of that
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.640]   first chapter, verse 19 to the end. Then, as we've been seeing, he takes it up, goes
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.480]   on with it here in this second chapter, he's dealing with objections. But the theme all
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:52.440]   along is the same, that no man can be justified except by faith. Therefore I say, as that
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.200]   is his theme, he cannot possibly be saying halfway through the theme that men, after
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.840]   all, can be justified by works. But, if there's anybody still in doubt about it, consider
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.320]   what he says quite explicitly, further on in this same great section. Take, for instance,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.920]   the ninth verse of the third chapter, where he says, "What then? Are we better than they?"
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.880]   That's to say, are we Jews better than the Gentiles? No, in no wise. "For we have before
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.560]   proved, both Jew and Gentiles, that they are all under sin." That's what he's trying to
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.680]   do. Then go on and watch him as he puts it again in verse 10. "As it is written, 'There
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   is none righteous, no, not one.'" Now that's a universal statement. There is no such thing,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.360]   he says, as a righteous person, not one. Therefore it is inconceivable and impossible that he
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.440]   should be saying in the sixth verse of the second chapter that there are some who justify
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.960]   or make themselves righteous, or save themselves by their works and by their deeds. And then,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.560]   of course, he winds it up in the twentieth verse, where he puts it once and forever in
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:21.520]   these words. "Therefore, by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.320]   For by the law is the knowledge of sin." Nothing more. It gives you a knowledge of sin. It
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.920]   doesn't save. It cannot save. "There is none righteous, no, not one." Very well, then.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:43.800]   I say that therefore that particular suggested explanation proves itself to be utterly and
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:52.480]   completely impossible. What then is the apostle saying? Well, here again, let me make a point
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.160]   with regard to biblical exposition. If we'd never had an example or an illustration of
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:07.400]   it before, we surely have it here, of the terrible danger of taking a verse right out
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.880]   of its context and establishing or founding a doctrine upon it. Now, people are very fond
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.080]   of doing this. It seems to me to be a very terrible thing to pick out a verse of scripture
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.160]   out of its context at any time, under any circumstances whatsoever. Now, we've got
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.520]   a great and a perfect illustration of that here. If you do that sort of thing, you can
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.640]   take out this sixth verse and here it is, "who will render to every man according to
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:39.420]   his works." And if you just look at it like that, you might as well jump to that false
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.480]   conclusion which I've just been dismissing. You see, the way to avoid that is to do what
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:53.320]   we've just been doing together. Every verse must be taken in its context. Every single
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.960]   text must never be divorced from its context. And that is why it seems to me that once more
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:10.400]   we ought to agree together that these so-called promise boxes are thoroughly unscriptural.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.720]   Not only can they be misleading and introduce a kind of element of chance or almost of magic,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.080]   it is to violate the scriptures. We must never isolate a statement in the scriptures from
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.760]   its own context. And generally speaking, you will find that if you are in difficulties
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.520]   about any one statement anywhere, the context itself will be your best guide with regard
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.480]   to your exposition. Much more important than a knowledge of Greek or Hebrew or any one
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:47.600]   of these things, the context is the greatest help conceivable to the exposition of any
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.480]   scripture. Because these men, enlightened and used as they were by the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.240]   have themes, and they work out their themes, and they're logical and they're reasoned
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.520]   and they're clear. There are some points where still we perhaps may not be able to
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:11.800]   arrive at finality in an exposition, but speaking generally, you can do so if you only pay attention
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.120]   to the context. Very well then, we come back and ask the question, if this is not teaching
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:26.200]   justification by works, what is it teaching? And the answer is this, that in the whole
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:34.720]   of this section, from chapter 1, verse 18, to chapter 3, 20, the apostle is not considering
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.560]   for a second the question of justification at all. He's not considering the way of
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:49.960]   salvation for one moment. It rarely doesn't come in. He stated that in chapter 1, verses
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:57.600]   16 and 17. Now then, this whole section doesn't raise, doesn't consider at all, the question
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:05.800]   as to how we are justified, nor how we are saved. Its theme is something quite different.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:13.720]   What is that? Well, what he's considering here is what it is that condemns us, what
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:21.000]   it is that damns us. The theme here is the wrath of God. And as I say, and as I have
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.600]   to keep on reminding myself and you, the apostle is elaborating it for one reason only, and
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.560]   that is because certain people don't like this doctrine of the wrath of God and try
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.360]   to evade it, try to get round it, try to avoid it in some shape or form or manner. The Jews
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.600]   in particular, but not only the Jews, certain Gentiles also, and it's still being done
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   by both these parties. So the theme all along the line is the wrath of God upon sin. And
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.960]   that's what he's still considering here. You see, something is necessary, he feels,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:07.280]   before he can elaborate positively the way of salvation. And that is this difficulty
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:14.560]   about the doctrine of the wrath of God. Ultimately, as I think we must have seen clearly by now,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:25.280]   no man will really seek salvation until he's clear about the doctrine of the wrath of God.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.920]   As long as a man thinks anyhow somehow that his works or his nationality or his family
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   or his birth or his associations or his profession or something else is somehow or other going
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.400]   to put him right with God, he'll trust to that and not to the Lord Jesus Christ. Now
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:48.160]   the apostle knew that very well. So he's clearing the ground. He is taking away every
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:55.440]   prop, every excuse, every subterfuge. He wants to prove this point that the whole world lies
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:03.280]   guilty before God, that there is none righteous, no not one. And that is what he is still doing
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:12.360]   in this particular section. Very well then, that is the theme. So what he is showing here
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:20.680]   is the grounds or the terms of judgment and of condemnation. And he's not considering
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.200]   anything else. You see, this is what he said in the fifth verse, "But after thy hardness
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.720]   of the righteous judgment of God, who will render on that day of wrath and of judgment
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.240]   to every man according to his works?" Those are going to be the terms of judgment, not
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.920]   salvation. He's not considering that. He's only considering the terms of the judgment
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:58.880]   on this great day of wrath. And as I say, what he is telling them is that on that day
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.040]   nothing will be considered except a man's works. It's no use anybody stepping forward
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.960]   and saying, "But I'm a Jew." The question is, "What were your works?" It's no use
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.040]   saying, "I was a Gentile." The question is, "How did you live?" The standard is
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:20.000]   one of works in judgment and condemnation. And it has nothing to do here, I say, with
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.840]   this great question of salvation. So let me put it like this. The Apostle's ultimate
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   object is to show that works cannot save a man. But he is equally anxious to show here
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:44.720]   that works can condemn a man. Our works can't save us, but our works can condemn us. And
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:54.920]   furthermore, the works I believe he is teaching here do at the same time indicate whether
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:03.000]   a man is saved or not. I believe that in addition to showing that we are judged and condemned
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.680]   by our works, he is at the same time saying that our works do actually show whether we
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:20.400]   are saved or not. In other words, salvation always leads to works of the type that the
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.200]   Apostle has been here describing. Now then, here is a point which I want to
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.480]   apply. Lest anybody should think that we are simply considering Jews at the time of the
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.440]   Apostle Paul and Gentiles at that time, this is something which is as relevant this evening
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:44.240]   as it has ever been. We've seen it earlier in this chapter that there is a tendency in
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.040]   all of us to do what these Jews were doing. Let me show you how that comes in here. There
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:16:03.520]   is nothing in a sense which is more dangerous than to think that mere belief of certain
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:11.640]   truths or acceptance of a certain teaching only, or the making of a profession of belief
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:20.480]   only, in and of itself saves us. Now I think you'll see where the relevance of all this
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.880]   comes in at the present time. There are certain tendencies in the Church today, it seems to
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:37.320]   me, for people to say to those who come forward as inquirers, or whatever you may call them,
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.240]   to give them the impression that as long as they say they believe that all is well. I've
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.640]   certainly known people in my experience in the ministry for nearly thirty years, I've
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.600]   come across many cases of that. Where people were definitely given the teaching that if
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:03.200]   they only said that they believed that that of itself saved them. Now I want to show in
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:11.240]   the light of this particular teaching how extremely dangerous that is. There was a great
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.640]   deal of this sort of teaching in the Christian Church about a hundred and seventy, almost
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.880]   up to two hundred years ago, associated with the name of a man called Sandiman. It was
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.920]   called Sandimanianism, or Sandimanism. And that was their teaching. They used to take
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.440]   that verse out of the tenth chapter of this epistle to the Romans, that if thou shalt
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.320]   confess with thy mouth thou shalt be saved. So the way to be saved was to confess with
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.800]   the mouth the Lord Jesus, and that saved you. They said don't worry about your feelings,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.880]   don't worry about anything. The scripture says if you say that you are saved, so if
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:56.080]   you say it you are saved. Now there is a tendency, I say, to revive that Sandimanian grievous
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.960]   heresy it seems to me, and to tell people, oh don't worry about your feelings. Don't
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.040]   look into yourself at all. All you've got to do is to say yes I believe that, and all
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:12.800]   is well. Now it seems to me that the whole teaching here contradicts that and shows us
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:20.320]   its terrible danger. In other words we must give full weight to all statements in the
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.960]   scriptures about works. Let me remind you of some of them. It was our Lord himself who
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   said this, you'll find it in Matthew 7 21, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:47.120]   shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father that is in
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   heaven." Now that's the Lord Jesus Christ himself. And that was not merely teaching
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   for the Jews before they rejected the kingdom. It is the teaching for all Christians at all
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.880]   times. You go to the end of Matthew's gospel and you'll find that he told them to go out
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:09.280]   and to disciple all nations, teaching them all things that I have said unto you. It's
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:18.000]   as applicable today as it was then. There is a specific one that merely to say, Lord,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.560]   Lord, does not say, "He that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." Take again
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.000]   Matthew 16 27, where our Lord says this, "For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.240]   his Father with his angels," he's talking about judgment, "and then he shall reward
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:50.280]   every man according to his works." Same exactly as Paul says here, you see. There it is, our
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:57.040]   Lord saying the very thing that the Apostle Paul tells us here. But then, of course, there
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:04.080]   is this tremendous statement which is made in the third picture in Matthew 25, to which
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:11.560]   I referred in passing last Friday evening. "When the Son of Man," Matthew 25, beginning
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.080]   to read at verse 31, "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.000]   with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.720]   all nations. And he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided his sheep
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.320]   from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on the right hand, but the goats on the left.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, Come ye, blessed of my Father, inherit
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.640]   the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was unhungered, and ye
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.360]   gave me meat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink. I was a stranger, and ye took me in.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.160]   Naked and ye clothed me. I was sick, and ye visited me. I was in prison, and ye came unto
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.720]   me." Obviously it wasn't whole nations that were doing all this, it's individuals, as
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:07.120]   I indicated last Friday. "Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:14.560]   we thee unhungered, and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger,
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.800]   and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.880]   came unto thee? And the king shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.720]   inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.120]   unto me. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:41.200]   into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was unhungered, and
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.840]   ye gave me no meat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink. I was a stranger, and ye
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.920]   took me not in. Naked and ye clothed me not. Sick and in prison, and ye visited me not.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:00.440]   Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee unhungered, or a thirst,
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.520]   you notice they call him Lord, they thought they were believers, they were interested.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.320]   Lord, when saw we thee unhungered, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.240]   and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.560]   you, inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:29.320]   ye shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.840]   Now there it is again. And you will find people, you see, who will try to find the doctrine
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.720]   of justification by works there again. They say, surely it's purely a matter of works.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.760]   Well that just means that scripture contradicts scripture blankly, and there is no need to
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:50.400]   fall back on such error and heresy. There is a perfectly simple explanation. The three
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:57.240]   parables in Matthew 25 are parables in connection with profession. And what our Lord is teaching
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:04.160]   there again, that there is no point in saying, Lord, Lord, unless your life corresponds to
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.360]   that of the same person. There are certain works that always characterize those who have
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   been born again of the Spirit. And if the works are not there, it's no use saying,
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:21.840]   Lord, Lord, it will avail us nothing. This question of works is essential in the matter
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.880]   of judgment. Then you remember the apostle putting it positively in Ephesians 2.10 says,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:35.800]   We are his workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus, unto good works, which God hath before
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:44.920]   ordained that we should walk in them. His workmanship, quickened, raised with Christ
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:51.200]   out of the dead and so on in the heavenly places, created anew unto these good works
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:58.640]   which he hath ordained that we should walk in them. Or listen to him writing to Titus
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.280]   where he puts it like this, The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:10.600]   men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:17.120]   righteously and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.720]   appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us. Why?
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.200]   Well in order that we might go on singing and still go to heaven, no, that he might
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:37.280]   redeem us from all iniquity and purify separate unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:46.080]   good works. These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority, let no man
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.280]   despise thee. Then we've seen what James has to say about it. He says, Even so faith
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.840]   if it hath not works is dead being alone. He also says this, Thou believest there is
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:12.040]   one God, thou doest well. The devils also believe it, but tremble. The same point you
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   see that this mere saying that you believe without anything else to support it or to
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.520]   demonstrate it is of no value at all. And then go on to the apostle John, the apostle
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.280]   of love as people like to call him, and John puts it very strongly indeed, first epistle
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:35.400]   of John, first chapter, verse six, you read this, If we say that we have fellowship with
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:46.280]   him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. In the fourth verse of the second
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:56.160]   chapter he's even stronger. He says, He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:05.280]   commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. One of the strongest statements in
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:11.200]   the whole of scripture. That is how the apostle John preached sanctification you see. He didn't
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   appeal to people to accept something which could be given as a gift. He says, Look here,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.960]   if you say that you know him and don't keep his commandments, I've only one thing to
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:29.840]   say to you, you're a liar, and there's no truth in you. In other words, the New Testament
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:39.120]   scriptures teach us everywhere that there is no greater danger confronting anybody who
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:46.160]   makes a profession of the Christian faith than what is called antinomianism. And what
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.360]   does that mean? It means this, that you rely upon the fact that you make statements and
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:58.320]   divorce that from your life. It is the tendency to say, Well, of course, as long as I'm
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:05.600]   saved it doesn't matter what I do. Antinomianism, anti-law, and the whole conception of commandments
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.080]   and doing the will and working out these good works unto which he hath created us, that
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:22.400]   we might do them. Or, to put it in its more modern garb, there is nothing, surely, which
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:33.760]   is more dangerous to the soul than what we may call a glib beleivism. And you see how
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.680]   this affects all our ideas of evangelism. If we are so anxious to get people through,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.760]   because we say, instead of leaving the Holy Spirit to do his own work, we say, But look
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.960]   here, it's quite simple. Here, you see, the scripture says, If you believe, you're
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:54.600]   saved. Do you believe? Yes, very well, it's all right. It may be all wrong. It may be
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:00.760]   terribly all wrong. And it can be an exceedingly dangerous thing to say that to a soul, and
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.840]   to give them the impression that because they've said they believe and accept that all is well.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   Now there is a sense in which we've got to say that to them. But we mustn't stop
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:18.200]   at that. We say this to them. We say, All you are living and all your good works can
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.040]   never save you. You've got to see that, and you've got to admit that to yourself
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.360]   and to God. You've got to see that you can only be saved by the Lord Jesus Christ. But
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:35.840]   his method of salvation is this. He works in you through the Holy Spirit. And the Holy
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:41.440]   Spirit will act upon you. He will bring into birth a new man within you. He will implant
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.080]   a new principle of life in you, and that will begin to show and to manifest itself. In other
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:53.200]   words, we must never stop at just believing. We must always emphasize regeneration, the
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.360]   rebirth, the new man. Otherwise, it seems to me, we are leaving
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:05.600]   souls in an extremely dangerous position. And therefore I argue that what the Apostle
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:13.800]   is saying partly here is this. That it's no use the Jew saying, I am a Jew and therefore
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.040]   I am all right. He says, No, your works are going to decide whether you're all right
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:24.080]   or not. It's no use a man coming in this Christian era and saying, But ah, I'm a
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.920]   church member, and I've always said that I believe these things. That alone won't
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:36.360]   save you. What's the record? What's your life like? What are these works? Well, the
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:46.320]   works, you remember, we saw last Friday evening are these. Patient continuance in well-doing,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:58.400]   seeking for glory and honor and immortality. And as he puts it again in verse 10, "To
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.840]   every man that worketh good." Now then, in other words, we can put it in
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:11.240]   this form, can't we? That there is no contradiction, obviously, between the Apostle Paul and the
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.200]   Apostle James. They're both saying the same thing, but they're both looking at it from
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.440]   a slightly different angle. But here, actually in this second chapter, it seems to me that
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.800]   the Apostle Paul is saying precisely what James says in the second chapter of his epistle.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:35.840]   Paul, I say, ultimately is concerned to show that no man can justify himself by his works.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.020]   The method of salvation is justification by faith only. Yes, but the Apostle is very anxious
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:48.280]   also that we should see that faith is real faith, and faith always leads to works, exactly
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.840]   as James says. Faith without works is dead. As the body without the spirit is dead, so
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.680]   faith without works is dead. It's the simplest thing in the world for a man to say, "I believe
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.360]   all that." I've known men who said they believed it who lived in drunkenness. I've known men
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.960]   who were living in adultery and went on in adultery to say they believed it all, and
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.080]   they had an intellectual apprehension of it all. But you see, the scripture speaks very
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:26.000]   plainly about such people. The Apostle John says that such a man is a liar. In other words,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   if this new life is in us, it will show itself. There will be a patient continuance in well-doing.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.800]   The man who is born again is a man, however feebly, is nevertheless seeking for glory
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:53.120]   and honor and immortality. He may in his folly at times backslide. He may allow the world
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:32:02.800]   to entice him for a moment, but the bent of his life is this seeking after glory and honor
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:09.880]   and immortality. In other words, we can test our faith by this. These are the works which
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.600]   are going to count. We shall not be judged in the judgment by a standard of absolute
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   perfection, obviously not. But what will be looked for, what will be expected of us, is
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:30.760]   this kind of work which is always the result of salvation. So the Apostle, it seems to
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   me, is doing these two things at one and the same time. His primary objective is to show
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:47.880]   that judgment is always in terms of works. And by that he is going on to prove that there
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:55.400]   is none righteous, that all are under condemnation because all have sinned. But at the same time,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:07.240]   I say, there is that further sentence, and we avoid it at our peril, in which he teaches,
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:14.320]   as the other scriptures which I have quoted to you teach so plainly and so clearly, that
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:24.640]   unless we've got some evidence of new life within ourselves, we are in an extremely dangerous
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:33.320]   position. The fact that we once said, "I believe, I accept," is not enough. If we
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:42.600]   are saved, we are regenerated. And you cannot have the new life of God in you without its
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.920]   leading to certain results. As I say, the Apostle puts it quite specifically. He has
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:56.720]   created us in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:04.160]   in them. So I come back to what I was saying last Friday. The thing we ask ourselves is
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:13.720]   just this. Am I seeking glory and honor and immortality? What's the thing that's uppermost
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:23.000]   in my life? What do I want? Which way am I facing? That's the question. There are people
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.960]   who say they believe, they're members of churches, but they seem to be living worldly
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:36.040]   lives. They're living according to a worldly outlook. Their interests seem to be those
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:41.880]   of the world. You're almost shocked when you find that they're in a place of worship
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:48.000]   occasionally. In other words, there is no evidence in the life. Now that evidence will
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.320]   be looked for on the day of judgment. Very well, that completes our consideration of
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:03.160]   that section which runs from verse 6 to verse 10. And that, you notice, leads on, quite
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:11.920]   inevitably, to the next section which we must proceed to consider. I see that we can't
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:21.640]   do more than just look at it this evening. Now the next section goes from verse 11 to
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:29.360]   verse 16. Let me just read it to you, so that you may ponder it during this coming week
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:36.000]   again. The most important statement of the scripture, another one that is very frequently
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.600]   misunderstood. It's the whole question that people often raise of what happens to the
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.880]   heathen who've never heard the gospel and so on. That's what's raised by this next
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:54.840]   section. Here it is, "For there is no respect of persons with God. For as many as have sinned
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.400]   without law shall also perish without law. And as many as have sinned in the law shall
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:07.360]   be judged by the law. For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.560]   of the law shall be justified. For when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.520]   the things contained in the law, these having not the law are law unto themselves, which
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:26.600]   show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:34.200]   and their thoughts or reasonings, the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another. In
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:44.760]   the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my doctrine."
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:51.840]   There you see you've got his fifth argument. The fifth argument with these people who don't
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.960]   like this doctrine of the wrath of God. Well now then think about that, and you notice
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:05.200]   that verses 13, 14, and 15 are to be found in brackets. They're a sort of parenthesis.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:14.360]   So you read verses 11, 12, 16, there's the big statement. Then these others, 13, 14,
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:22.960]   and 15, a parenthesis, elaborating the main proposition which is stated in the other verses.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:29.160]   Well as I say our time has gone. That other matter was so important that I felt I must
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:38.640]   stress it and emphasize it because of its terrible danger. But let us never forget what
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:54.320]   the scriptures say about works, even to the believer. Let us pray.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:04.040]   We come into thy presence again, our heavenly Father, and we admit and we confess and acknowledge
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:10.960]   how weak and how frail and how foolish we are. We see how ready we are to clutch at
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:18.600]   anything that seems to deliver us from the plain teaching of thy word. We see how helpless
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:25.320]   we are when faced with the subtlety of Satan. Oh God, we thank thee anew and afresh for
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:34.360]   thy word and for its warnings as well as its teachings and exhortations. Oh Lord, open
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:43.760]   our eyes, open our understanding to these things. Oh God, forbid it that anyone in thy
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:52.880]   presence here at this moment should ever be surprised at that great day. Lord, God, give
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:59.520]   us that wisdom which will enable us always to take the whole scripture. Deliver us, we
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:05.960]   pray thee, from being more concerned to prove or to establish that which pleases us than
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:14.280]   that which thy word actually says. Keep us, O God, from ourselves and the perversions
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:21.640]   that sin has introduced into our minds as well as into the whole of our being. Oh God,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:28.680]   we pray thee therefore, lest with a false zeal we may not only do harm to ourselves
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:38.120]   but also harm to others. We thank thee that salvation is thy work and we thank thee for
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:48.360]   its greatness, for its profound character. Lord, receive our humble praise. And now may
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:54.880]   the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:06.120]   of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore. Amen.
