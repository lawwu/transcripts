[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   - There's ideas of panpsychism where people believe
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.240]   that whatever consciousness is,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.880]   is a fundamental part of reality.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.280]   It's almost like a physics law.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.960]   Do you think, what's your views on consciousness?
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.000]   Do you think it has this deep part of reality
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.240]   or is it something that's deeply human
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.900]   and constructed by us humans?
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.520]   - Start nice and light and easy.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.360]   - Easy.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.680]   - Nothing I ask you today has actually proven answer.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.160]   So we're just hypothesizing.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.080]   - So yeah, I mean, I should clarify,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.200]   this is all speculation and I'm not an expert
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000]   in any of these topics and I'm not God.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.560]   But I think that consciousness is probably
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.120]   something that can be fully explained
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.480]   within the laws of physics.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.120]   I think that our bodies and brains and the universe
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.480]   and at the quantum level is so rich and complex.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.720]   I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a room
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.120]   for consciousness there.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   And why should we be conscious?
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360]   Why are we aware of ourselves?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.600]   That is a very strange and interesting
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.120]   and important question.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.080]   And I think for the next few thousand years,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.640]   we're going to have to believe in answers purely on faith.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.520]   But my guess is that we will find that
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   within the configuration space
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300]   of possible arrangements of the universe,
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.720]   there are some that contain memories of others.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.580]   Literally, Julian Barber calls them time capsule states
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.480]   where you're like, yeah,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.680]   not only do I have a scratch on my arm,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.600]   but also this state of the universe
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.160]   also contains a memory in my head
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.000]   of being scratched by my cat three days ago.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.360]   And for some reason, those kinds of states of the universe
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.200]   are more plentiful or more likely.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.520]   - When you say those states,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.400]   the ones that contain memories of its past
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.160]   or ones that contain memories of its past
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.800]   and have degrees of consciousness?
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.200]   - Just the first part,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.600]   because I think the consciousness then emerges
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.560]   from the fact that a state of the universe
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   that contains fragments or memories of other states
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.000]   is one where you're going to feel like there's time.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.560]   You're going to feel like, yeah,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.840]   things happened in the past.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.400]   And I don't know what'll happen in the future
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.040]   because these states don't contain information
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.200]   about the future.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   For some reason, those kinds of states
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.680]   are either more common, more plentiful,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.280]   or you could use the anthropic principle and just say,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.920]   well, they're extremely rare,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.160]   but until you are in one, or if you are in one,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.280]   then you can ask questions
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   like you're asking me on this podcast.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.120]   - Why questions?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.000]   - But yeah, it's like, why are we conscious?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.880]   Well, because if we weren't,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.680]   we wouldn't be asking why we were.
