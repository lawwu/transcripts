[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Was A.W. Tozer wrong on sovereignty?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.200]   Today's question arrives from a listener named Josh.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.680]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.000]   I'm a Christian of only a few years and I'm learning more about Calvinism and election
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.800]   in my studies.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.520]   My question is, to what degree are our actions in daily walk with God predestined?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.000]   If I recall correctly, A.W. Tozer believed Providence was like a cruise ship.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.960]   The ship's final destination is settled and certain.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.360]   That's Providence.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.160]   But on the open water, what we each do on the ship is open to our own free volition.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.240]   So Pastor John, how much of our daily life is sovereignly directed by God?
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.920]   Well, I love A.W. Tozer, but that's a bad analogy.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.560]   Yes, it really is.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:04.120]   Sorry, A.W. The last question, how much of our daily life is sovereignly directed by
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.800]   God?
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.480]   My answer is all of it, down to the tying of your shoelaces and the brushing of your
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.760]   teeth, which I'll try to show from the Bible in just a minute.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.900]   There are several problems with this proposal that says life is like a cruise ship whose
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.000]   destination is sovereignly decreed while the life on the ship is not sovereignly decreed.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.380]   And here's the first problem.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:48.740]   It implies that the choices we make in life on the ship don't have any decisive effect
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.860]   on the outcome of our lives, the destination of the ship.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.180]   That's not true.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:05.540]   Hebrews 12.14 says, "Strive on the ship for the holiness without which no one will see
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.100]   the Lord," that is, arrive at the destination.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.500]   No holiness on the ship, no destination in heaven.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:23.100]   So disconnecting sovereignty over the destination from sovereignty on the ship is unbiblical.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.640]   Here's another way to say it, or same point, different angle, why this is an unbiblical
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.860]   proposal.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:42.580]   The Bible is pervaded by teachings that God's sovereign control is complete, not partial.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.420]   It governs every aspect of nature, every aspect of history, national, personal, life.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.100]   Nothing, absolutely nothing is outside God's sovereign governance.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:10.260]   Now the way he controls all things, whether it's more or less direct or more or less indirect,
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.020]   more or less by active intrusion or more or less by tactical permissions, however God
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.740]   controls, the control is complete and pervasive.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.980]   Nothing in the universe is random or without divine design and purpose.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.700]   Now I don't say this because of any philosophical assumption about the nature of God.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.020]   I think philosophical assumptions here are the nemesis of true biblical thinking.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.700]   We should come to the Bible and try to listen to it for what it says without bringing our
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.740]   philosophical assumptions to it.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.500]   So I'm not saying this because of an assumption about, "Well, that's just the way God has
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   to be.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.660]   That's what God means," or, "That's what human will does or doesn't require," or, "That's
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.500]   what causality is," or what—I'm just not even thinking that way.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.460]   I'm trying to just come to terms with text.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.340]   So let me give you the texts that are governing me here, or at least give them to Josh so
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.260]   that he can ponder them.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.820]   Proverbs 16.1, "The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue"—that
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.060]   is, what really happens—"is from the Lord."
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:44.340]   Proverbs 16.9, "The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord"—what really happens—"the
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.860]   Lord establishes his steps."
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.820]   Or Proverbs 19.21, "Many are the plans of the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.940]   the Lord that will stand."
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.780]   That's what's happening on the ship, right?
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.060]   That's not just the end of the ship, cruise.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.940]   Proverbs 20.24, "A man's steps are from the Lord."
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.060]   How can he understand his way?
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.540]   Or Proverbs 21.1, "The king's heart is a stream of water."
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.260]   This would be one of the crew members on the ship.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.820]   The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.140]   He turns it wherever he wills.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.940]   Now all those texts refer to ordinary, on-the-boat decision-making.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:39.340]   So if what Josh means by our decisions being "open"—that's what he said—"open
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.660]   to free volition," if what he means is that we have ultimate self-determination on the
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.780]   ship, well, the answer is we don't.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.700]   There is no human ultimate self-determination.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.660]   Only God has ultimate self-determination.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:07.620]   We are free in the sense that we can do whatever we choose, but ultimately God governs what
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.100]   we choose.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.300]   We are not God, and we cannot veto God.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:23.460]   That's what Job had to learn in 42 chapters of warfare with God when he concludes in Job
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:32.420]   42, "I know that you can do all things, and no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:40.140]   So no purpose of God's can be vetoed by a purpose of man.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.340]   What we think is random in this world or uncontrolled, the Bible says, is from the Lord.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:53.620]   So it says things like Proverbs 16:33, "The lot is cast in the lap," or we would say,
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.980]   "The dice are rolled on the board."
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.060]   But every decision is from the Lord.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.420]   So that's choosing a random thing and saying, "No, it's really not random from God's
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.420]   perspective."
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.460]   And Jesus, if you're bothered by all those texts coming from the Old Testament, which
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.340]   you shouldn't be, but if you are, here's Jesus' way of saying the same thing.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:25.460]   Jesus says in Matthew 10, "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny, and not one of them will
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.940]   fall to the ground apart from your father?"
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:36.840]   Now, I think the reason he chose two sparrows and one of them just dropping dead off a branch
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.620]   in the jungle somewhere is that that just seems to be the least significant thing in
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.620]   the world.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:50.380]   Like a bird dying in a forest somewhere that only God knows about, that's really random
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.100]   and insignificant.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.500]   And Jesus says, "Well, you may think it's random and it may be insignificant, but it
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.580]   is controlled by your father."
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.140]   So even the hairs of your head are all numbered, he adds, and then he makes the wonderful application,
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.140]   "Fear not.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   Fear not.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.180]   You are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.220]   Well, there's a "therefore."
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.220]   Fear not therefore.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.180]   In other words, the sovereignty of God over the details of the universe and our lives
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.140]   is meant to take away fear.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:24.620]   The control of God, our Father, our good, loving Father who works everything together
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:31.700]   for His glorious purposes and our good should make us bold as a lion.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.580]   I would say James, the book of James in the New Testament, is virtually thinking the same
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:47.860]   way that Josh is thinking, namely, we're on this boat and the question is, are the
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:54.540]   random, seemingly insignificant little things we choose on the boat governed by God?
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:00.420]   So James says, "Come now, you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.300]   town and spend a year there and try to make a profit."
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.300]   Like, okay, you think you're going to go somewhere on this ship?
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.860]   "Yet," he says, "you do not know what tomorrow may bring.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   What is your life?
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.940]   You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:23.740]   Instead you ought to say," and here comes the answer to how detailed God's governance
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:31.420]   of the behavior on the ship is, "Instead you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.340]   will live," that is, we won't die on the cruise, "and we will do this or that,"
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.700]   that is, we'll go to the top level of the ship or the bottom level of the ship or we'll
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.340]   stand in the sun today or we'll eat at six or five today, whatever, "we'll do this
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.180]   or that if the Lord wills.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.860]   As it is, you boast in your arrogance."
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:57.420]   So it seems to me that James is saying there is meticulous, complete sovereignty over our
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.980]   living, over our doing this or that, and the purpose of it is not only what Jesus said,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.940]   namely courage, but humility.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.920]   It's arrogant not to think this way about our cruise behavior.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:21.680]   One last observation. If you think that you can be faith-filled, obedient, holy on this
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:30.280]   cruise ship without the sovereign enabling of God, then you don't know your own sinfulness
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   and you don't know the preciousness of the work of the Holy Spirit on the ship.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:43.600]   There's only one hope of pleasing God on this cruise ship, and that is the sovereign work
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   It's just baffling to me.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:55.280]   In fact, it makes me mad when Christian teachers try to take the sovereignty of God away from
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.800]   the nitty-gritty battle for holiness, which is everything in our Christian life.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.000]   So here's the key text for me.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.960]   Hebrews 13, 20, 21, "Now may the God of peace equip you with everything good that you may
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:20.300]   do His will," here it comes, "working in us that which is pleasing in His sight through
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.880]   Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.080]   Indeed, indeed, amen.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:34.080]   To Him be glory, not just for getting us to the destination by sovereign decrees, but
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:41.840]   also for enabling us to do everything good that we have to do on this ship.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.120]   The ship is the place where we live, where the glory of God will shine or not shine,
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   and to take the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit by which we are enabled to do what
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.240]   pleases God away from this ship is crazy.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:03.080]   First Corinthians 15, 10, "But by the grace of God, I am what I am on this ship, and His
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.360]   grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:12.800]   On the contrary, I worked on this cruise ship harder than any of them, though it was not
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.280]   I, but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:26.200]   So the destination on the ship and all of our life on the ship are governed by the one
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:34.280]   who, Ephesians 1, 11, works all things on the ship and in our destination, all things
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.760]   according to the counsel of His merciful will.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.760]   Amen.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.960]   Sovereignty in the nitty-gritty details of our lives.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.280]   I love what you said, Pastor John.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.880]   The sovereignty of God over the details of the universe and our lives is meant to take
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.280]   away fear.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   Amen.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.560]   That's really good.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.840]   Well, Jesus is my substitute.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.080]   That's one of the great and glorious truths of him.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.200]   He became sin for me that I might stand before God righteous and forgiven.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.960]   It's beautifully true.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:14.220]   But is Jesus also my joy substitute too, my hope for when I fail to delight in God as
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   I ought?
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.800]   It's another really sharp question from a listener thinking through Christian hedonism
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.560]   in their daily life, and we will address it on Monday.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.240]   On the other side of the weekend, until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   [END]
