So don't spend any time thinking about asteroids hitting the earth. You can't do anything about it. Now, when looking at these scenarios, categorize the advice that you're getting and the actions that you're getting. Make sure you're not ignoring any of them.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   But make sure you're not giving equal weight to all of them. Recognize the probability varies. I beg of you, if you're sitting in a cabin in the middle of the woods, waiting for the zombie apocalypse and ignoring the goals and the dreams that you have in your life because you're scared of the zombie apocalypse, leave now.

[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.340]   3. Similar to a depression.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.340]   4. Similar to Mad Max.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.340]   5. Void of humans.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.340]   Think about the scenario and plan rationally.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   Don't react emotionally.
