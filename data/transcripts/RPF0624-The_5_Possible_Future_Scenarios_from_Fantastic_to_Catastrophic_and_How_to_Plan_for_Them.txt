[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.560]   ♪
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.700]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.100]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.340]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.980]   My name is Joshua. I am your host. And although I am your host,
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.720]   today, the outline of today's show does not come from my own head.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.680]   Rather, it comes from a client of mine, who sent it on to me and said,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.020]   "Joshua, I think you should do a show on my five possible scenarios of the future."
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.160]   [laughs] And so, of course, I worked with him. He'd shared with me the five shows before.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.900]   But I had him send them over to me, and I said, "Yes, this is a useful concept."
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.060]   Now, this client is an experienced and effective businessman.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.440]   Wealthy. Has built his businesses, starting with nothing, but basically nothing.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.040]   Self-made man. Saved his money. Built his business. Has done well.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.480]   And he shared with me that this is the way that he categorizes information.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   This is the way that he categorizes the potential scenarios of the future.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.080]   And I think it's really useful, because as humans, we need to categorize things.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.560]   You can't face everything and assign the same importance to all things.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.220]   And there's a major problem when people do this.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.900]   You can't assign the same probability to all things. I'll explain in a moment.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.600]   First, let's go through the five possible scenarios.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.580]   If you're thinking about the future, you can plan and predict that the future will fall into
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.640]   one of these five possible scenarios.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.020]   Number one, the future will be about the same as the present, or maybe a little better.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.220]   Again, scenario number one. The future will be about the same as the present, or maybe a little bit better.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.100]   Number two, the future will be similar to a recession.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.500]   Again, similar to a recession.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.000]   Number three, similar to a depression. The future will be similar to a depression.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.640]   Number four, the future's going to be about like Mad Max.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.380]   Go watch the movie if you are uninitiated.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.880]   Actually, I'll tell you a little secret. I've never been able to get through Mad Max.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.220]   I'm aware of the allusion to Mad Max, but that's just not my deal, not my interest.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.700]   I've never actually watched Mad Max, so maybe you can skip it too.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.040]   But just know that Mad Max means really bad people doing crazy stuff, driving around, crazy survivalist world.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.640]   So number four, the future will be similar to Mad Max.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   Or number five, the future will be void of humans due to an asteroid hitting the earth
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.180]   or some other similar wipeout calamity.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.380]   I repeat, five possible scenarios.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.520]   Things in the future will be about like they are now or better.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.220]   Number one. Number two, similar to a recession.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.520]   Number three, depression.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.560]   Four, Mad Max, or five, void of humans.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.520]   Now let's talk about these because all of these are absolutely reasonable scenarios.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.260]   It is possible that the future will be about the same as things are now or better.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.740]   It's also possible to be recessions, depressions.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.340]   Mad Max is possible.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.400]   And it's possible that the asteroid will hit the earth.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.240]   The long term, in the long, long term, the future of the earth, it ain't good.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.440]   So this earth will be wiped out in the future.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.280]   Now, will it be your lifetime, my lifetime?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Who knows?
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.020]   But the point is all of these are perfectly possible scenarios.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.760]   And what's more, all of these have been experienced at some point in the history of the earth.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   So what do you do?
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:07.700]   Well, first, I think it's good to look at probabilities and recognize that some of these scenarios are more probable
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.600]   than others.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.400]   For example, is it very probable that things in the future will be about the same as they
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   are now or perhaps a little better?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.400]   I would say so.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.040]   It's very probable that the future will be at least about how it is now, maybe better.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.000]   That's the most probable of these five scenarios.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.760]   Is it also very probable that in the future we'll face something like a recession?
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.240]   Absolutely.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.100]   I would be happy to guarantee it if my money were on the line.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.260]   I would guarantee the future contains a recession.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.180]   It's very probable that the future will have a recession in it.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.180]   What about a depression?
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.720]   Well, a depression is less probable than a recession, just like a recession is less probable
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.840]   than the future being about like things are now or better.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.720]   But it's very still probable.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.580]   It's still very probable that at some point in your life we'll go through depression.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.040]   What about Mad Max?
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.580]   Less probable.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.100]   But throughout the history of the world, even, sorry, throughout the history of the last
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.000]   few decades, the last half century, we could point to again and again and again situations
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.560]   in which things are Mad Max.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.860]   Even if you're in the United States or Australia or the United Kingdom, you can find circumstances
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.360]   in the last 50 years that have been Mad Max.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.080]   Hurricane Katrina was Mad Max.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.280]   Pretty hardcore stuff.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.040]   Even if you start to go, you know, Bosnia, Syria today, all kinds of places, you can
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.080]   go all kinds of places around the world and find today Mad Max.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.200]   Now it's less probable for those of us who live in fairly stable countries, but it's
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   not impossible.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.920]   And then number five, void of humans due to asteroid hitting the earth.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.380]   Fairly probable in the long run.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.240]   We just all hope and trust and believe that it's going to be the very long run.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.460]   Now think first on scale of probability.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.020]   Think next on scale of preparability.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.500]   Is it preparable for you?
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.660]   Can you prepare for a future that's about the same as now or better?
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.660]   And should you?
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.260]   My answer is yes.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.540]   You should spend the majority of your time, based upon the probabilities of the future,
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.220]   you should spend the majority of your time preparing for a future that is about like
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.300]   things are now or better.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.300]   You should not spend the majority of your time preparing for a future that looks like
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.820]   Mad Max.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.700]   You should spend the majority of your time preparing for a future that looks about the
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.260]   same as things are now or better.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.020]   And make sure that you're prepared and positioned to thrive.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:28.200]   You should spend some time, some significant time, preparing for a future that has a recession.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.500]   Because it's fairly certain that the future will have a recession.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.060]   But don't spend so much time preparing for a recession that you don't prepare for something
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.060]   that's better.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.360]   Let me give you an example.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.060]   You have a job offer.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.180]   You're excited about the job offer.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.900]   It's a change into something new and exciting, but you don't have any money.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.180]   Should you sit around worrying about a recession, about the fact that you don't have enough
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.020]   money to break your lease and go take the new job?
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.020]   No!
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.500]   Prepare for things to be about the same or better and go get after it.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.180]   Go get after the future being better.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.420]   But think about the recession.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.740]   So think about the probabilities and go with them.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.020]   But prepare for a recession because it's very likely that you will face a coming recession.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.080]   What about depression?
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.000]   Depression is still pretty probable.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.300]   Very probable.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.500]   You should spend less time preparing for a depression than preparing for a future that's
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.340]   like now or better.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.100]   But you should still prepare for a depression.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.900]   Mad Max?
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:44.660]   Mad Max is possible, if not probable, over a long period of time.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.580]   The challenge we face is figuring out what that appropriate timeline is.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.980]   The toughest thing that I face?
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:58.300]   Given my age bracket, things have always been pretty good in my life.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.980]   I can ask my parents and grandparents about World War II and what things were like.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.700]   I can ask them about Vietnam.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.460]   I can ask them about the 1970s.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.620]   But I wasn't there for those things.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.940]   So it's just all history.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.580]   You might be similar, have many young listeners, or you might not be.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.820]   But the point is, think about it, but don't spend all your time preparing for Mad Max.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.380]   Mad Max is not certain.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.380]   Possible?
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.380]   Yes.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   Probable?
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380]   Maybe.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.300]   Depending on how we use the word probability.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.980]   But not certain.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.300]   Don't spend all your time preparing for Mad Max.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.940]   Thus missing out on preparing for a great future.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.700]   Think about Mad Max.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.260]   Prepare for Mad Max.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.700]   But don't dwell on Mad Max.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.740]   Number five.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:55.740]   Scenario five where the Earth is void of humans due to an asteroid hitting the Earth.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:01.940]   You can't prepare for that with storing food and water.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.460]   Your only preparedness in that situation is spiritual preparedness.
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.460]   That's it.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.460]   That's all you can do.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:13.020]   If there's an asteroid coming in on top of you, ask the Lord to see you through.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.660]   That's all you can do.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.480]   So don't spend any time thinking about asteroids hitting the Earth.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.100]   You can't do anything about it.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:31.860]   Now, when looking at these scenarios, categorize the advice that you're getting and the actions
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.220]   that you're getting.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.820]   Make sure you're not ignoring any of them, but make sure you're not giving equal weight
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.060]   to all of them.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.060]   Recognize the probability varies.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:52.620]   I beg of you, if you're sitting in a cabin in the middle of the woods waiting for the
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:58.380]   zombie apocalypse and ignoring the goals and the dreams that you have in your life because
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:06.940]   you're scared of the zombie apocalypse, leave now while you still have a chance of living
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.820]   your life.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.540]   Keep the cabin, but don't live there if the only reason for living there is a zombie apocalypse,
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.220]   because a zombie apocalypse, Mad Max, is not very likely.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.700]   I think it's wise to prepare, but it's not likely.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:29.500]   So please assign an accurate probability to the different scenarios that you face in your
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.620]   life.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.620]   Try it out.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.620]   See if it works for you.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.620]   It's worked for my client.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.020]   I like this particular framework to think through.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.340]   The future will be one of the following.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.060]   Number one, same as now or better.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.580]   Number two, similar to a recession.
