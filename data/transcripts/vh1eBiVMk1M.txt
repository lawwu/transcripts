[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the seventh chapter, reading verses 37 and 38.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I'm still anxious to consider with you that last statement about Moses, namely, that he received the lively or the living oracles to give unto us.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Now, though many of you are familiar with the context of this statement, it is essential that I should repeat it, because if we don't understand the setting and the context of these two verses, we cannot hope to understand their meaning and their message.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   This is a part of a speech, a statement which was delivered by the first Christian martyr, whose name was Stephen.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And here in this chapter, we find him standing before a great court in Jerusalem that was called the Sanhedrin.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And he's been asked to speak for himself. The chairman presiding says, "Are these things so?"
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And Stephen begins to give his reply. "What is he charged with? Why is he before the court at all?"
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Well, the answer to that is given at the end of the previous chapter.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   These are the charges that were brought against him.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   They subdued men which said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And later they set up false witnesses which said, "This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, the temple, and the law."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Now that's the charge. In other words, this man is on trial because he's a Christian.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And because he's a preacher of the Christian message. A man who is active in the life and the work of the church.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Now, you see, to the members of the Sanhedrin, that was blasphemy.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   They felt that this man was preaching against Moses, against the temple, and against the law of Moses.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And to them, of course, these were the most precious and priceless things in connection with the whole of their lives.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   These people were Jews. And as Jews, they were proud of the fact that they were the people of God, a separate, a unique people.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And they were particularly proud of their temple.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And the fact that they were descendants of Abram, and that they were the possessors of the law that was given by God to Moses on the top of Mount Silo, as Stephen here reminds them.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   But here was a teaching they felt, which was not only attacking death, but was speaking blasphemously against it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So they felt that such a man was not fit to live, that he should be put to death. And so he is on trial.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And what we've got in the chapter is Stephen's reply to this charge.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now, the reply takes a very interesting form. He just takes them over their own history.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   If you look at this matter merely from the standpoint of intellect, of a defense, it's brilliant. It's brilliant.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   There's no other word that you can use. He meets them on their own ground. He knows the people he's dealing with.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And a good advocate always addresses his judges, his jury, whoever they are.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He knows their point of view, so here Stephen takes their own ground. He's a Jew himself, and he knows exactly what they take pride in.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So he takes them over their own history. Why does he do that?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Well, he does that in order to show them that they've completely misunderstood their own history,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and that it is the very things that they're so proud of that are condemning them.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Here they are. They reject Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   They say that. They've said it specifically. It's a part of the charge brought against Stephen.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   They have rejected Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Stephen and the others were proclaiming that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and that he'd come into the world to save the world, and that he is the only Savior.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   They'd said that. Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That was their position. Now, but these people reject Christ.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Why do they do so? That's what Stephen is out to show them.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And it is the most amazing thing. They are rejecting Christ in terms of their law and their leader, Moses, and their temple.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And what Stephen does is to show them that the real reason why they are rejecting Christ is because they've never understood Moses,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   never understood the law of Moses, never understood the real meaning of the temple.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Now this is really something which is quite astounding.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It is, of course, the great tragedy, the greatest tragedy that has ever happened in the whole story of the human race.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   There is no tragedy that is in any way comparable to the tragedy of the way in which the Jews rejected their own Messiah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Here they are, the people of God. You read about them in the Old Testament, these great institutions, these great men, these great leaders,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and how they were looking forward to the coming of the promised Messiah.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yet when he came, they of all people rejected him.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And while they were rejecting him, Gentiles were ready to believe in him and to accept him and to yield themselves to him.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And this, I say, is the profoundest tragedy of all time.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And what Stephen is doing is to try to show them the essence of this tragedy.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   He says, "You are gloating in Moses and charging me with being a denier of Moses."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He says, "Your whole trouble is you've never understood Moses.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You've missed the whole point about Moses, and especially about the law that he received from God,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   the law that you're proud of, the law that you're boasting in, and you've never understood your temple.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   You're going to your temple, you're proud of your temple.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   If anybody says a word against it, you raise your holy hands in horror,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   but you've never understood the real significance and meaning of everything that is represented by the temple."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Now that's what he's doing.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   He's showing them that they're blind to the things of which they were most proud,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and thereby committing this tragic blunder of refusing and rejecting the very Savior
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   who was prophesied by Moses and the temple and the law of all these things.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's exactly what he's doing.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Now here in these two verses, he really does bring it to a focus and to a climax.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   He's told them, reminded them of the history of Moses, but he says, "Now listen, this is that Moses
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   which said unto the children of Israel, 'A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Him shall he hear.' This is he which was in the church in the wilderness."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   What happened? He was with the angel which spake to him in the Mount Sinai.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's a reference to Moses going up onto the mountain to receive the law,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   as described in the 19th chapter of the book of Exodus and following.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And also, he was with our fathers in the journeyings, but this is the thing.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   He was the man who received those living oracles from God to give and to pass on to you.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Now then, the argument you see is this.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Nothing is more important than that we should understand the message that was delivered by God
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   to Moses to the children of Israel.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   That's the explanation of the greatness of this people, that they had this living word.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yes, but what they fail to see is that this living word is the very word that has foretold the coming of Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   the Son of God, the Savior of the world.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They're proud of the word, but they've never understood the word.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   That's the whole tragedy of the Jews.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   That's why their city was destroyed in AD 70.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That is why they were cast out amongst the nations.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   That's why they've suffered through the centuries.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   That is why they're here as a kind of pillar, warning all mankind
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   that the greatest tragedy of any individual or of any group of people
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   is to refuse and to reject and to fail to understand the word of God.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Now then, that's exactly why I'm calling attention to it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I'm not just interested in the case of Stephen.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I know you are not, as such.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You know, our world is on fire.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   The world is in a desperate condition.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   We haven't got the time to indulge just a little historical interest and investigation.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   No, no, my dear friends, I'm not calling your attention to this
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   simply because I'm interested in history of God.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I've got this kind of antiquarian interest.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   This is exactly the trouble with the modern world.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Mankind is still rejecting the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   That's why our world is as it is.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   That's why any one of us is miserable and is a failure.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It's the cause of all the human tragedy in individuals and in groups of individuals.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It is the rejection of the word of God, the whole word of God as we have it in this book,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   especially, of course, as it comes to a focus in Jesus of Nezareth, the Son of God.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Very well, then, what is important for us?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Well, it is to listen to this word.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   That's what Stephen is saying to these people.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   You're proud of this word from Moses, these people, but have you understood it?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Have you realized what this word is saying?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   If you did, you wouldn't reject Christ, you'd believe in him.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And I want to hold this same word before you this evening.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And I pray that God would grant that that be the result likewise,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   that as we see this word and receive its message,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   we shall be driven to this Savior whom the world is still rejecting.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Now, what do we find here?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Well, this is the thing, this word, the living oracles.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You see, Christianity is a word from God.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It's a revelation.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Moses received on that Mount Sinai.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   As I put it last Sunday night, Moses didn't go up on the Mount Sinai to enter into a sort of retreat
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   in order that he might have time to do research work and to think in peace and quiet
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   and evolve his theory and come down and give it to the people.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That is the exact opposite of what happened.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Moses received it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   God gave it.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That is what differentiates this gospel from everything else in the world at this moment.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Everything else is the product of human ability and understanding.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   This is of God and it is from God.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It is God's word.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's my only right to be in the pulpit.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I'm no better than anybody else.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I have no message of my own.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Who am I?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I'm as fallible as all other men.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   My only authority in this pulpit is that I am simply passing on to you.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Receive the lively oracles to give unto us.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I'm simply a mouthpiece.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   A man who occupies the pulpit to voice his own opinions is a liar to start with in addition to being a fool.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And he's arrogant.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   The business of the preacher is to expand, open up the word of the living God.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   He has no other right, no business whatsoever.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   This, I'm not preaching human understanding.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I'm not preaching modern philosophy.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I'm not preaching modern politics or sociology.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I am simply holding out before you this word of God that's recorded in this book and that God has used throughout the running centuries.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It's from God.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And we've looked at its great characteristics.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   It's a living word.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   It's a powerful word.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's a penetrating word.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   It's a convicting word.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   It's a word that searches us and examines us.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's why it annoys so many people.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   No preacher has ever annoyed congregations as much as the Lord Jesus Christ did.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   You read about him, don't you?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He preached and we're told that the Pharisees gnashed their teeth at him.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Sometimes after he preached they took up stones to throw them at him.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And in the end they killed him.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   They crucified him, the son of God.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   You see, the modern man says, oh, that he likes Jesus.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   He thinks Jesus was one who talked about pacifism and peace and love.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And they all think that they'd like Jesus.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   My dear good friend, take it from me.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   If you heard Jesus preaching, you'd hate him.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   The very people who praise him would be the very first to hate him.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   They're understanding him exactly as these members of the Sanhedrin were misunderstanding Moses and the law and the temple.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   The effect of our Lord's preaching was that people were infuriated by him.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Why?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Oh, because it is a searching word, dividing asunder even the joints and marrow and the soul and spirit,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   and is a disowner of the very thoughts and intents of the heart.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   There is nothing that can make a man feel so uncomfortable as this word,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   when it really comes to him and speaks to him and opens himself out to him,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   puts his neck back and bears it as it were with a sword over it.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   That's the meaning of Hebrews 4, 11 to 13.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Now then, this is the word that we are considering.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   What's its message?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Well, this is the great message of the law.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Moses received the living oracles, the word of God, the law.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   What's the message of the law?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   The message of the law is primarily about God.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   It starts with God, and then it comes to men and tells men the truth about himself,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   about his own essential greatness as made in the image and likeness of God.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It then tells him how he is to live, the Ten Commandments.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   That's it, that's the word of God.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   There's no need to argue as to how we should live.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   God has told us how to live.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Ten Commandments.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   You remember the first table and the second table.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Second table, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, and so on.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That's it, that's still God's way for us to live.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And that means that it's something that condemns us,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   because we don't live that life.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   We don't keep this law.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   We have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Now then, there is the kind of introduction to this word of God, this word of the law.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   But what we must concentrate on is this penetrating character of this word of God,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   this word of the law.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And what does it reveal to us?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   What does this word of God really tell us about ourselves?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   We've seen already that we can't keep that law, that none of us has done so.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   But that isn't the whole truth about us.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Are you ready for it?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You ready to hear the truth about yourself?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   You ready to come under the x-ray of God, for that's what this word is?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   It searches, even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and the joints of marrow.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It goes right through, there's nothing hidden.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Everything in the recesses, it's brought out, it's exposed.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And as I open this word to you tonight, you will be reminded of what you know to be true about yourself.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   It's unvarnished truth.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   What is it?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Well, what it tells us is what I may describe as the depth of sin.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Here is the thing that the modern world needs to know more than anything else.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   It's not surprising that the world is as it is.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   The world is as it is because it doesn't know the cause of its troubles.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   That's where these poor statesmen, what else can I say about them?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They're so missing the mark.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   They'll break the Sabbath and have their conference in Chequers.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   It's all right, they've got to do these things.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   They needn't do them on Sunday, they've got all the time.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But you see, they think they're going to deal with the problem.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   They're not.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Whether we enter Europe or not, that's not the problem.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   These things have their place, of course they have.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   You've got to have politics and economics and all these other things.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   But what is so ludicrous is that anybody should imagine that this is the ultimate way to deal with the problem of man.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It isn't.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's tinkering with symptoms and manifestations.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   The problems are only dealt with in this book.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Literally. Nowhere else.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And what the book reveals, of course, is what I'm calling the depth of sin.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And the word of God was given, the law was given, especially to Moses, in order to bring that out.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Why did God call Moses up onto that mountain and give him this word, this law?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Well, it was in order that the problem of men might be revealed as it is.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Men has always known that there is something wrong.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Men indeed has always known that he's wrong and that he's guilty.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   There is not a living being but that at some time or another has suffered remorse.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   That means that you're aware that you've done something that is wrong and you're unhappy about it.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   And you say, "I'll never do that again." But then you go on doing it.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Now that's remorse. Now what produces remorse?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And there's a simple answer. That is the conscience.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   In every one of us there is what is called the conscience.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   A sense of right and of wrong.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   In other words, before you do certain things, something tells you don't do that. That's wrong.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And then you ignore it and you do it and you suffer.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   You're punished. Your conscience speaks to you and it keeps on hammering away at you.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   You try to fight it. You try to dismiss it psychologically.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But it doesn't matter. It's there. It goes on speaking.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Now this is innate in every human being.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Everybody has a sense of right and wrong. That's what makes us all responsible.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Even the law of the land recognizes that and we are held responsible.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   That is the conscience. Everybody has got this conscience.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And it's been there from the beginning.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Now the Apostle Paul puts this very plainly in his epistle to the Romans in the second chapter.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Where he puts it like this.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   "As many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   He says, "For when the Gentiles which have not the law."
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   He means this law that was given by God to Moses on the top of Mount Sinai.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   "When the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   these having not the law are a law unto themselves,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Now he says that's true of everybody.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   The Jews have been given the law through Moses.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But everybody else, even those who didn't have the law,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   they've got all in a sense that is stated in the law in principle,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   written in their hearts, their conscience.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   He says, "Look here, you accuse one another, you excuse yourselves,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   excusing and accusing one another."
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   He says, "Well what kind do we do with it?"
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Well that's because we've got this thing which we call the conscience.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   This sense of right and wrong.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And when a man says, "You've done wrong, you shouldn't do that."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I do the same thing and I explain it away, I excuse myself,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   but I know I'm wrong, I know I'm a hypocrite.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   My conscience tells me that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Now this is something that's in every single one of us.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Why then was the law ever given?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   The law was given through Moses in order that this thing which our heart tells us
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   might be revealed to us, opened out to us,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   made so plain to us that nobody can get away from it.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Now that was the whole object and function of the giving of the law.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I could give you many quotations to establish what I've just been saying.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   They're chiefly written by the Apostle Paul.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   He says, "The law was added because of transgressions."
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   "The law," he says, "came that the offense might abound."
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That's at the end of the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   "Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   that it might be seen more and more clearly."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And then he puts it like this, as we read just now in the seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   that the commandment might become, that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   The law was sent in order that we might see the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   That sin might appear as sin.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   You see, we're all so clever. We manipulate the conscience.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   We explain things away. Now then, the word of God comes and it says,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   "Wait a minute, listen to this," and it fixes us.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And you can't wriggle out of it. It's there and it speaks. It exposes it.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   You've got nothing to say. You just hold up your hands.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   The x-ray has revealed everything. The exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   By the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Now what's he mean? Let me just divide it up a little bit for you.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   This is the sort of thing the law tells us.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   The law uses this word about coveting.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Do you remember how Paul puts it there in that seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   He says, "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Nay, I have not known sin but by the law, for I have not known lust,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   except the law hath said, Thou shalt not covet."
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   What does he mean? Well, you see, what he means is this.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   We are all so clever, aren't we?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And we tend to think of ourselves only in terms of actions.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And we tend to say, "I've never got drunk. I've never committed adultery.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   I've never done this. I've never done that."
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And therefore we think we're perfect. We're all right. We don't need Christ.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   We don't need your gospel. We haven't done this. We haven't done that.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   "Oh, wait a minute," says the law.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   "It isn't quite as simple as that. Have you ever coveted?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Have you ever lusted?"
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "You know," says Paul, "there was a time when I used to judge like that.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And I thought I was almost perfect.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   But the law suddenly said to me, 'Thou shalt not covet.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his men's servant,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   nor his maid's servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that belongs to thy neighbor.'
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And you know," says Paul, "the moment I realized that, I died. I was finished.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I was standing on my feet. I was a wonderful man.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   But the law says you must not covet.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   The law says that a desire is as damnable as a deed.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   To covet is as reprehensible as is to commit."
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Now, this is, you see, the kind of message that the law brings home to us.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   We can manage our conscience all right. We've never done this or that.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And on we go happily. Suddenly the law comes and it says, "Wait a minute.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Let me examine your mind, your heart, your thought, your imagination."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And of course, our Lord did this still more.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   He turned to people and he said, "It's out of the heart that come evil thoughts,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   murders, adulteries, and so on.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   You think you're innocent. You think you're pure.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You're blaming the age in which you live.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   You're blaming the films and the hoardings and the novelettes and the books.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You say, 'I'm all right if I'm only left alone.' You're not," he says.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   "You're a liar.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   It isn't that which goes into the men that defiles the men. It's that which comes out.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It's out of the heart that come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   People sinned before there was a cinema.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   People sinned before there ever was a television.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   People sinned before they could read.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Where does it come from? It comes from the heart of men.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Coveting, looking on at another man's wife or a wife looking at another man's husband.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Desire, here's the thing that this word alone reveals to us
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and brings us under condemnation. Coveting.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Now that's one of the things that it does and as it does it, it shows us the depth of sin.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   It reveals our heart to us.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And there's nothing else that does this.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   How often have I quoted the 51st Psalm from this pulpit.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Poor David, King of Israel.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   You remember, don't you, what he did?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   He was a man of strong passions.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   He suddenly saw another man's wife and was attracted, lusted, desired, coveted.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And he was so lustful that he not only committed adultery with the woman,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   he killed her husband in order that he could have her.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And he was quite happy. Everything was all right.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He'd had his desire, but God sent his prophet to him.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   God sent his word to him through the prophet Nathan
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and convicted him and brought it home to him.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And David writes the 51st Psalm and there he admits it all.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   "Create in me," he says, "a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   That's the trouble. It isn't so much the temptation, it's that in me that responds to it.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I am vile, I am foul, wash me. I'm filthy.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   But he didn't see that until the word of God came to him.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   That's what the word of God does. That's what the law of Moses does.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   "Thou shalt not covet."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And David comes to see it and this law, when it really comes to us, it makes us all see it.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   That we are rotten in our hearts. That what we really need is to be born again.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   But then he does another thing.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And it's all in this seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans that I read at the beginning.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And you know there's nothing on earth tonight that enables us to see these things but this word of God.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Look at what he tells us about the power of sin.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   The modern man doesn't like the term sin.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   He says, "Nonsense. Sin. There's no such thing as sin."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   He says, "I'm not as good as I ought to be. I'm not 100% perfect, but I'm not bad, I'm not evil, I'm not really sinful.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   If I want to stop doing a thing, I can stop doing it.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Men have told me that hundreds of times about smoking and drinking and many other things.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   But it's a very much easier thing to talk than it is to do, isn't it?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I'm not condemning smoking incidentally in passing. That's your problem, not mine.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But when a man tells me I can stop it like that, well all I say to him is, "Well do it then and give me proof."
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And then when he tries it, as I once did, I found it was the biggest fight I think I've ever had in my life.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   How easy it is to talk. The power of sin.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Oh, it's only here you read about the power of sin. Listen to it.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold unto sin.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   For that which I do, I allow not. I know that what I'm doing is wrong, I don't allow it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   But I do it. What I do, I allow not. For what I would, that do I not. But what I hate, that I do."
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Is this a psychopath? Was the Apostle Paul, before his great days, was he a psychopath?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Can you really dismiss this in terms of psychology? Well all I say is this.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   If the Apostle Paul says that that was true of him because he was a psychopath,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   well then I diagnose every one of you as psychopaths.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Because that's the simple truth about every one of you, as it is true of me by nature.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Every one of us.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Nothing but this word tells you that, does it?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Your psychology doesn't tell you that. Your politics most certainly don't tell you that.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You don't get votes by telling people the truth, especially about themselves.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   No, no, nobody tells you this but this word of God, but this is what it tells you.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   "I do what I hate, that do I. Here's my trouble.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. How do I know that?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Well, to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Why not? What's the matter? Why cannot we all do what we know to be right?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   We read books on idealism, on philosophy and humanism, and we tell this is the way to live,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   and if only we all did this our problems would be solved.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   You know these clever men, they can solve the whole problem of war.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You say, "You only need to know this and that, the war is folly, so you stop doing it."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Well, then why in the name of conscience is the world still going on with these things?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   That's the question, and there's only one answer.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   It's the power of sin. It's the power of sin.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   "I know that in me dwelleth no good thing, for to will is present with me,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   but how to perform that which is good I find not.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   For the good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do."
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   What's the matter with me?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   "I do that, now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   What is it then? "It is sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   for I delight in the law of God after the evil of men.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   O wretched men that I am! Isn't that the truth about all of you?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Of course it is. But where else did you learn that?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Nobody else has ever told you that. Nobody ever will.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   The law was given through Moses in order to show men that he's got a law in his members,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   that there's a power in him greater than himself.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Even he knows what's right, he can't do it.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   The law in the members, dragging me down, making me a captive.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Man's a slave to sin and lust and passion.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Here alone are you given that information.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And then he goes on to show its perverting power.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Well, this is the most terrible thing you see about sin in us.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It will twist anything.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Sin is so powerful that it can even twist the law of God.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   That's the argument of Paul in the whole of this chapter.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   He puts this question.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   What shall I say then?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Is the law sin?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Why does he raise that question?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Why does he go on saying that the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   was then that which is good made destined to me?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   What's all this about? Well, I'll tell you what he's saying.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   This is what he's saying.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   He says, you know, when I really saw the true character of the law,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   when I really saw what God had said to Moses,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   he thought he knew what God had said to Moses,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   but when he was convicted by the Spirit, he understood it for the first time.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And he said, this is what I discovered,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   that the very law which God gave to me through Moses
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   made me worse instead of better.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   He actually says that. Listen to the fifth verse.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   aggravated by the law, energized by the law,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Put in very simple terms, that means this.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   If you tell the natural man not to do a thing,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   you at that moment create within him a desire to do it.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Now you've seen that in babies and children, haven't you?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   You tell them not to do a thing, they'll want to do it immediately.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   The law in Jamaica is done, they've done it.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   That's in the whole of human nature.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   So the very law of God becomes an enemy to us.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   In telling people not to do a thing, you are inciting them to do it.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Now, you see, I could very easily spend the rest of the time tonight
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   in showing you the practical relevance of that to the moral problem
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   confronting this country and every other country at the present time.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   They think that it's enough to tell people, you see,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   don't do that because it's bad, do this because it's good.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   It's no good. You in a sense make them worse by telling them not to do things.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   You're reminding them of them, you're introducing them to them.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And they will read books on the evil effects of certain practices
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   in order to get a kick out of reading them.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   A man says, "Oh yes, here's a book now.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I think this book will help me with the sex problem
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   because it shows me the possible dangers and evils."
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And he tries to persuade himself that's why he's reading it.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   That isn't his reason for reading it at all.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   He's reading it because he knows it's going to stimulate him
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   and he'll be worse at the end than he was at the beginning.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I remember a minister telling me that a book he once read
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   called "The Mastery of Sex" did him more harm than anything he'd ever read
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   in the whole of his life.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   The title was "The Mastery of Sex."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   You'll never master sex by reading about it.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   The law is twisted by sin.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Even the law of God which is so good.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I found that it was against me, says Paul.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It was doing me harm rather than delivering me.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Why? Not because there's anything wrong with the law.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   But because of the nature of this sin that is in me.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   But sin that it might appear sin,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   working death in me by that which is good.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   That sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   What a terrible thing this is.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Now can't you see my dear friends that it is only this message
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   that tells us things of this nature and of this order?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Isn't this the thing that the world needs to know tonight above everything else?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Have you read about this recent illustration from the world
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   even at its best, at its academic best?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Of how blind it is to the nature of the problem.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   You've read, haven't you, of the decision of Cambridge, the city of Cambridge.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   They've decided to introduce the use of natural gas
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   rather than manufactured gas as soon as possible.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Why? Do you know the answer?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Because of the number of suicides amongst poor students
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   who put themselves to death by gassing themselves.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And what the authorities do about this terrible, tragic problem is
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   to introduce natural gas instead of manufactured gas.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   There's a perfect illustration of how the world, without the word of God,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   misses the whole problem.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   They change the gas instead of changing the nature of the poor, unfortunate students.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   The problem is, why does anybody ever want to commit suicide?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   What is it that has brought this poor, tragic student to this condition
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   that he can't face life and go on any longer?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   There's the problem. They don't see that.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And they change from manufactured gas to natural gas from the North Sea.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Oh, if it were not so tragic, it would be the joke of the centuries,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   the joke of history.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   It's so typical of men without the word of God.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   He doesn't realize his problem.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   He doesn't realize the nature of sin, the depth of sin, the power of sin.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And nothing will ever bring him to that realization
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   until he comes face to face with the living word,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   the living oracle of God as given through Moses and the prophets
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   and perfectly through the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   That's what this word teaches us.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And so, you see, I move to my second point,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   which is more or less covered already, which is this.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   The law was given to reveal to us our utter and complete helplessness.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   That was the whole tragedy of the Pharisees.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   That was the tragedy of these members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Why had they rejected Christ?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   The answer was they thought that they were satisfying God as they were
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and by their own efforts.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   There's no other reason.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   That was the whole trouble with the Pharisees.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   He thought he was satisfying God.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   He thought he was keeping the law.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   He completely misunderstood the law.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Now Stephen, you see, is making this point with the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And these are the points.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   To know about the law is of no value in and of itself.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   The whole object of the law is that we should keep it.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Listen to Paul putting it in Romans 2 again.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   For not the hearers of the law are just before God,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   but the doers of the law shall be justified.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   You see, the foolish Jews, they said we are all right.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   We are the people of God.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   You say to them, how do you know you're all right?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Well, they said we've got the law. God has given us the law.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   He didn't give it to the Gentiles.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   We have the law. We possess the law.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   It is taught in our synagogues every Sunday.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   We are hearers of the law.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And they thought that because they were listening to the law that they were right.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   But Paul says not the hearers of the law are just before God.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   But the doers of the law shall be justified.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   That you are interested in morality and ethics is not of the slightest value.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   The question you'll have to answer at the burr of God's judgment is not what did you think, but what did you do?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   That's one fallacy. Here's another.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   The law of God must be kept in its entirety.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   The whole of it.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's like you saying I have kept 99% of the law.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   It won't help you at all.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   You can be convicted for having failed on the 1%.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   This is stated clearly by James in the 2nd chapter of his epistle.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   He says whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   For he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   You see it's not help to you at all.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   If you're charged in a court of law, let me say, let's take a random example.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   You're charged in a court of law with having stolen somebody's property.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And you get up, you're asked by the magistrate have you got anything you'd like to say for yourself.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   You say yes. He said well what is it?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Well you say I have never committed adultery.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I have never got drunk.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I have never exceeded the speed limit.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And on you go with a great list of what you haven't done.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Doesn't help you.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   It's not the thing you're being charged with.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   You are guilty of this thing.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   And that is the statement which is everywhere in the law.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   You don't pick and choose in the law, you've got to keep it all.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   And if you don't keep it all, you are guilty under the law.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Next.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   The spirit of the law is more important than the letter.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And this was another tragic blunder on the part of the Pharisees and these members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   They thought that as long as you kept the letter of the law, as they understood it, that all was well.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   They'd never understood that the spirit of the law is much more important than the law.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Why did God ever give the Ten Commandments?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Why did he ever say thou shalt not kill, commit adultery, steal and so on?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Why? What's the point of it all?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You see the point of it all as our Lord explained in the Sermon on the Mount is this.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   It isn't the mere letter of the law that matters, it's the spirit.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And what God wants is that we should love him and love our neighbour as ourselves.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   You remember he was asked one day, which is the first and the greatest commandment?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   And you see these men, they knew that there were 613 points in the law.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   And they were arguing about themselves, said this is the most important, no answer to the other, it's that.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And they were arguing and wrangling which is the first and the cheapest.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   So they come to our Lord, they said which is the first and the greatest point of the law?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   He said this is it.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   This is the first and the cheapest commandment.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And the second is like unto it.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   This is the thing that matters.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Why are you not to kill? Why are you not to steal? Why are you not to commit adultery?
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Why are you not to covet? Well because you're meant to love your neighbour as yourself.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   You can go around the world and say I've never struck my neighbour.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   I've never spat upon my neighbour.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   I've never done this and that to my neighbour.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   And you think you're a paragon of all the virtues.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   The law of God comes to you and says look here my friend the question is do you love your neighbour as yourself?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   What have you thought about your neighbour?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And it's the same in your attitude towards God.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And that is where the Pharisees unmasked and exposed.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   And that is where the members of the St. Edwin show they've never understood the true nature of the law.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   They're interested in the latter.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   We've never done this, we've never done that.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Listen says Christ.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   You say I have never committed adultery.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   All right let me ask you a question.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Have you ever looked at a woman to lust with her?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   If you have you've already committed adultery in your heart.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Same with killing.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   A man says I've never committed murder.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Have you ever said of your brother thou fool?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   If you have says Christ you've already committed murder in your heart.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Now that's the thing that the word of God tells us.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   This is the meaning of the law.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   It exposes the real nature of sin.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   And the man thinks he's perfect.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   He can satisfy God.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   The law speaks and he's condemned.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   He's guilty.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   He's powerless.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   He's vile.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   He's filthy.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Now nothing but the word of God, nothing but the law of God can ever bring this knowledge to us.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   But it does it always and invariably.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   This is why the law was given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   That that which is there in embryo in the conscience might be made explicit.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And we might all realize that we need to be delivered from the guilt of sin.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   We need to be delivered from the power of sin.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   We need to be delivered from the pollution and the filth of sin.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   That's the trouble.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   That's the need.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   That's the thing that Stephen was saying to the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   You say that I'm blaspheming the law.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   It's because you've never understood the law.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   I'm telling you the real meaning of the law.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   That's what the Jesus whom you've crucified did.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   You hated him because when he expounded it he convicted you.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   And you hated him because he did so.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   That's why you rejected him and crucified him.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   That's his message.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And it is the message to the modern world which says it doesn't need Christ.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And talks about its learning and its morality.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   But its world is in chaos and its heart is rotten and is vile.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Nothing along the effort of men can ever deliver it.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   It shows us our complete helplessness.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   But it shows us one other thing.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   It not only shows us that we can do nothing about our guilt or ever deliver us from ourselves,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   from the power and the pollution of sin.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   It shows us that we can never satisfy God and stand before him.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   You say but surely God is a God of love.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And surely if I say that I'm sorry God will forgive me.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   My friend, the law that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai gives the lie direct to that argument.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Can I prove that? Yes, quite simply.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   How do I prove it?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   What did God tell Moses on that mount?
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Well, he gave him the Ten Commandments.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And I've just been expounding them to you.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   But he didn't stop at that.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   He also gave him very detailed instructions about building a tent called a tabernacle.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   And he told him to build it according to certain plans and specifications.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Gave him certain measurements.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Told him what material to use and how much to use.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   He told him to build an altar.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   And then he gave him a great list of rules and regulations about taking various animals,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   a lamb every morning and every evening,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   and killing him and taking the blood and presenting him as an offering.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And all the burnt offerings and sacrifice and meal offerings and peace offerings.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Have you ever read the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Go and read them.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   They're the word of God.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   It's a part of the word that Moses received from God on that mount Sinai.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And he told him to go down and say,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   "See that thou do all things according to the pattern shown thee on the mount."
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   But what's the meaning of all this?
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Here it is.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   So many people say to me, "I'm not interested in your Old Testament."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   I can't be bothered to read those books you've mentioned.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   And all about this shedding of blood and offerings and sacrifice.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It's got nothing to do with me, hasn't it?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   It's got everything to do with you.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   What's it saying? Well, what it's saying is this.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   That God demands satisfaction.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   And that he will have satisfaction.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   He's the judge.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He decides, not us.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   You say, the modern man says,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   "Say you're sorry, all is well, you'll all go to heaven."
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   You won't.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   That's what you say.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   You've got no authority at all.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Do you want to know what God says?
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   He gave it to Moses.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Moses gave it to the people.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   The members of the Sunnahidin have completely misunderstood it.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   They say, "This man Stephen and these Christians are blaspheming the temple."
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   They didn't know the meaning of the temple.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   They thought the temple was just a place you went through a certain ritual and ceremonial
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   and you walked out all right, as Roman Catholicism still teaches.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Confess your sins to the priest, do this and that, all is well.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   You buy your salvation.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   What a travesty of the word of God.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   No, no.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   The whole object of the temple and the tabernacle and their ceremonial
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   and all the burnt offerings and sacrifices
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   and all that you read of there was one thing only.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   And that is that God is to be propitiated.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   That God demands satisfaction.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   He said so in words, "Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin."
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   God wants a perfect offering from us.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   We can't give it.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   But you say, "My good works surely are going to count."
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   No, no.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   God has said through his word, "All your righteousness is as filthy rags."
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   This is the cardinal error.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   You see, not only the Jews at that time of the Old Testament,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   but even a man like the apostle Paul before his conversion,
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   he fell into this error.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   That's what he tells us in that bit of autobiography
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   in the third chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Now listen to this.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   He says, "If any man ever had a right to have confidence in the flesh, I more."
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Why?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Well, he says, "Circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew of the Hebrews,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   as touching the law, a Pharisee concerning zeal, persecuting the church,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   touching the righteousness which is of the law, blameless."
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Blameless?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Now he really believed that.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   He was a highly intelligent man.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   But he so misunderstood this law of God
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   that he thought he was literally blameless.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Because he had never actually murdered a man,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   he was not guilty of murder.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Because he had never actually committed adultery with a woman,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   he wasn't an adulterer, and so on with all of them.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   But suddenly he saw the spirit and the coveting,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   and he realized he was a terrible sinner.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   So, having bursted of all this marvelous righteousness of his,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   he now says,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   "But what things were gained to me,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   those I counted loss for Christ?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   and to count them but as done,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   that I may win Christ and be found in him,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   but the righteousness which is of God,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   by faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   And there is the whole thing.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   The word that God gave to Moses is a word that tells you this,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   that nothing that you can ever offer to God
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   is of the slightest value.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   You can tell him about all the good works you've done,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   and he'll dismiss them all,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   because he knows your mind,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   he knows your heart, he knows your imagination,
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   he knows the foulness and the blackness that's there,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   it's filthy rags, it's done, it's lost, it's refuse.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   And you can take to him all your money,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   and you can say I've given a thousand to this cause
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   and a thousand to another, it's useless,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   valueless, nothing at all is of any value.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   God demands a perfect sacrifice,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   he demands a life,
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   and he taught the children of Israel that
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   through the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   He said take a lamb, put your hands on his head
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and metaphorically transfer your sins to the animal,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   kill the animal, take the life,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   present the life in the blood to me.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   But you see, he made it perfectly clear to them
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   that this was only temporary,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   this was only something prophetic.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   He said this is only something for the time being,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   to cover over your sins for the time being.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   This isn't going to save you,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   but this is pointing forward to something that I'm going to do
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   that will save you.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   In telling them to offer a lamb morning and evening,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   God was saying there's a day coming
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   when I'm going to provide the lamb.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   There is a day coming when I will provide
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   the perfect sacrifice myself,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   and he will be big enough and great and pure enough
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   to take your sins.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   The blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   can never cleanse the soul, it's not enough.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   It's only a prophecy, it's an adumbration,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   it is a type pointing to the lamb that I'm going to produce.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Which is just my way of saying what Paul puts in these words.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   God never gave the law to the children of Israel
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   in order that they might save themselves by keeping the law.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   God knew they couldn't keep the law.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   Their consciences were already condemning them.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   And to define the thing makes it still more difficult.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   That sin might become exceedingly sinful.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Where there is no law, there is no attribution as it were of sin.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   That's the business of the law, to bring it home.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   But the foolish Jews, they thought that the law was given
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   in order that they might save themselves by it.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   And so they've completely misunderstood it.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   That was the trouble with the Sanhedrin,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   as Stephen is pointing out to them.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   He blaspheming the law, they're blaspheming the law
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   in their misunderstanding of it.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   The law was never designed to save anybody.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   For no man can save himself by keeping the law.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   By the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   By the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Why then did God ever give the law?
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   I've already given you the answer.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   God gave the law to mankind
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   and it speaks to you and to me this evening, this message.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   He gave it in order that we might see the truth about ourselves.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   That we are not only guilty, we are vile.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   We are not only helpless, we are hopeless.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   We can do nothing.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   God demands perfection.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   We cannot give it.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   The law shuts us up to Christ.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   It was given for that reason.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   It was a schoolmaster, a pedagogue, to lead us to Christ.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   The purpose of this word that was given by God through Moses
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   to the children of Israel was to bring home to them their sinfulness,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   their lost condition, their guilt, the punishment that was coming,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   and the need of some propitiation
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   which they could never supply themselves.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   God tells them that by the temple and its ceremonial
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   and it points them forward
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   to the coming of the Lamb of God
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   that shall take away the sin of the world.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   And he is this Jesus
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   whom the Jews rejected,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   whom the Sanhedrin is still rejecting.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   That's their blindness.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Listen, says Stephen, to them. Can't you see?
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   You have misunderstood all the things of which you are boasting
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   and you are bringing damnation on yourselves.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   See it, repent, believe.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Give yourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Recognize in him the Lamb of God, the Saviour of the world,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   the one who can take away your sins
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   and reconcile you to God
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   and give you new life and a new nature
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   and a new heart and a new power and a new strength,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   make a new man of you
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   and rid you of that which drags you down
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   and finally present you faultless and perfect
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   before the presence of God
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   with exceeding joy.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   My friend, I leave you with questions.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Have you seen the exceeding sinfulness of sin?
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   In yourself.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Have you realized how you stand in God's sight at this moment
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   as you are by nature?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Do you know you're guilty? Because you are.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Do you know you've got a vile nature
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   which you can never put right?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Do you know you need someone, something outside yourself
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   to put you right with God?
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Tell me, have you been shut up unto Christ
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   as the schoolmaster taught you that
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   if it has all blessed of God,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   you are reconciled to God,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   you have nothing to fear from the law
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   and heaven's gate is open wide for you.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   Amen.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
