[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   The largest unsolved problem in cities is what the heck we're going to do about climate
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.800]   change and the cities of the developing world.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.240]   This is the thing I do not feel like I have any answer for in terms of how it is that
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.180]   we're going to stop Manila or Mumbai from being leveled by some water-related climate
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.540]   event that we haven't yet foreseen, right?
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.960]   We sort of think that we're going to spend tens of billions of dollars to protect New
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.680]   York and Miami, and that's going to happen.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.280]   But the thing I don't understand and the thing that I think we really need to invest in in
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.920]   terms of knowledge creation is what are we going to do with the low-lying cities of the
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   developing world to make them safe?
