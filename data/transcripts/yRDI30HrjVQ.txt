[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   I'd like to talk a little bit about nutrition and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.440]   Dr. Lane Norton, who's been a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast and we both know throughout
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.640]   a number range related to protein intake on the backdrop of how much protein synthesis
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.000]   can occur by meal across the day, et cetera, a lot of research done there and some important
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.560]   work by him in particular.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.240]   And then the value that he threw out was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight being the
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.480]   lower end of the range up to, I believe it was as high as 2.4, maybe even as high as
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.940]   2.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960]   That's a pretty broad range, but it's on the higher end of what I think most people think
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.120]   of in terms of protein intake.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.000]   And then again, some people might already be right there or maybe even above that value.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.800]   Of course, this all depends on whether or not people are omnivore, vegan, meat-based,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.960]   et cetera.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.560]   We won't even go there.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.240]   But assuming people are getting enough protein per day, so somewhere in that range, and they
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.140]   are spreading out that protein intake to accommodate the fact that the body can only assimilate
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.520]   a certain amount of protein in any given setting, what do you like to see people ingest at some
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:34.720]   point post-hypertrophy-inducing workout in order to get the protein synthesis advantage,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.820]   if you will, that is stimulated by that workout?
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.760]   Earlier you mentioned the post-training feeding window that in the '90s and probably earlier
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   people were talking about, oh, within the first 90 minutes you have to get 30 minutes
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.980]   of, excuse me, a certain number of grams of carbohydrate and protein, et cetera.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.400]   I think now the understanding is that that window is much broader and how broad, et cetera,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.120]   is still a matter of debate.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.720]   But when somebody is training specifically for hypertrophy, assuming they are getting
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.080]   enough protein from quality sources in their other meals and assuming that their overall
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.540]   macronutrient intake and caloric intake is high enough, that is they have enough of a
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.540]   caloric surplus that they have the raw materials for hypertrophy, what do you like to see people
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.880]   ingest at some point post-workout in order to facilitate muscle protein synthesis and
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   recovery?
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.560]   And this could include nutrition and supplementation, or if you want to divide those answers out,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   feel free to do so, of course.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   Okay, great.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.880]   So, a ton of work came out of Don Lehman's lab, who was actually Lane's mentor, as well
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.360]   as Stu Phillips at McMaster, so a ton of work there and we can answer a number of things
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   here.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.980]   So, Lane's numbers that he recommended, also known as about a gram of protein per pound
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.980]   of body weight.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.980]   It's a great start.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.300]   Now, once you slide below that, one gram per pound, which is also 2.2, it was 1.6 grams
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.140]   per kilogram of body weight, all the way up to, I think it was 2.4, but maybe as high
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.940]   as 2.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.580]   So, 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing, so 2.2 grams per kilogram is the same as one
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.580]   gram per pound.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.140]   So, depending on which—where you're listening at to this at, one of those may be easier
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.900]   than the other for you.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.980]   If you start getting below that number, now you do start running into questions of protein
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.940]   quality, protein type and protein timing.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.780]   This is one of the reasons why I actually fully agree with Lane, is just get that number
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.220]   higher than you think and then all those other variables don't matter.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.020]   If that number is low, then you need to start paying attention to a bunch of other stuff.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.500]   You've added now complexity to your program, things you got to pay attention to, just stay
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.980]   high and it doesn't matter, and so you can just leave a lot of those things off the table.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.340]   That seems to be fairly clear in the work of some of these gentlemen I just mentioned,
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.500]   that as long as you get to that total number, the question about timing and types and quality,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.700]   it seems to matter a lot less.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.300]   In fact, Stu's recent work in non-animal-based proteins, it really showed that to be fairly
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.260]   clear that those are quite effective, assuming total protein intake is high enough.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.380]   The amount of leucine and other amino acids in those actual proteins matter less if the
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.220]   total threshold is just super high.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.420]   So just do that and you're fine.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.460]   Now the other caveat we have to say here is timing of macronutrients is—seems to be
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.700]   somewhat irrelevant for protein, but that is not the case for carbohydrates.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.780]   So that timing does matter.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.340]   Replenishment of muscle glycogen is very specific and you want to make sure that that is around
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.900]   a lot if you're doing either maintaining training quality or you're sliding into endurance
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.900]   type of work.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.020]   So macronutrient timing does matter with carbohydrates, maybe less so with protein and certainly less
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.580]   so with protein if the total protein ingestion is high enough.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.900]   So it depends on what we're going after in terms of a training goal and where we want
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.020]   to get with all these things.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.100]   In general, the way that we like to think about this is if you're doing a strength
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.620]   type of work where you're truly targeting that, then a one-to-one post-exercise protein
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.060]   to carbohydrate ratio is generally what we're gonna go after.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.580]   So this would be something like 35 grams of protein and 35 grams of carbohydrate.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.900]   It doesn't have to be post, it can be pre or my favorite is actually mid or post, but
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.220]   somewhere in that range especially if you're training in the morning and you have not consumed
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.220]   anything prior to your workout.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.700]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And that's not necessarily eating in the middle of the workout that's
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.700]   drinking calories.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.700]   Evan Brand: Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.700]   It's gonna be a—
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.300]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I need to see someone eating a sandwich in the gym although I'm
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   sure it's happened.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.380]   Evan Brand: Yeah.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.620]   So one-to-one is that like sort of standard number here.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.540]   If you're gonna do sort of more of a really hard conditioning workout, that number slides
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.740]   up to something like three or even four to one, which would be carbohydrate to protein
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.740]   ratio.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.020]   So if we want to stay at 35 grams of protein, we're gonna go maybe as high as like a hundred
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.780]   or 140 grams of carbohydrate, again, depending on what type of training we're sort of doing.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.540]   If you're gonna do a little bit of a combination, then you—like a little bit of strength,
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.460]   a little bit of conditioning and kind of a standard workout which is probably something
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.300]   that a lot of people will do, then you maybe want to go to something like two-to-one.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   So you know, 35 grams of protein, 60-70 grams of carbohydrate.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.860]   And those are kind of just like rough numbers that you can go by.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.620]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And for pure hypertrophy training, would you like to see people ingest
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.620]   some carbohydrate post-training?
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.340]   Evan Brand: For pure hypertrophy training, I want to see that as many of those nutrients
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.380]   around the training as generally possible.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.980]   Now again, I may change my mind when our fasting study comes out, but as it stands now, there
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.540]   is no advantage to not fueling around the training and there are some known and some
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.700]   other potential advantages to fueling.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.540]   So I just see no reason to not do it.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.900]   In fact, most people are generally going to do better.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.940]   Now this is not science, this is just my coaching experience and this is with our athletes and
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.300]   all of our non-athletes that we've worked with and do work with.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.540]   They're just going to be better spreading those meals out generally throughout the day
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.180]   and they're going to be better if they have those nutrients either pre, mid or post.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.660]   And so they're going to get even for hypertrophy, they're going to get something like that
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.380]   one 3 to 1 ratio of carbs to protein.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.900]   Personal preference, some people don't like to eat before they train, some people have
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.260]   to eat before they train.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.140]   Some people can't put food in their belly immediately after—work around that.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.260]   You can play based on personal preference, but we want that fueling in there because
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.180]   we want to maximize the potential growth and we want to just get a jump start on recovery
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.180]   because we're going to be training again pretty soon.
