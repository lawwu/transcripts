[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   I should like to call attention this evening to that passage of scripture that has been
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.200]   read to us some time ago, out of the second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.420]   And I want particularly to call attention to the 42nd verse.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.080]   And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.480]   bread and in prayers.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.840]   But I want at the same time to hold this passage before you as it presents us with a picture
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.360]   of the early Christian church.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.080]   In other words, I want to direct attention to the nature of the church, or the doctrine
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.720]   of the church.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.760]   I do this because I believe it is the most urgent matter that we should be considering
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160]   at this present time.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.140]   There are many, many reasons which compel us to consider this doctrine.
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.400]   One of course, and a very big one, is what is called the ecumenical movement.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.640]   All this talk and organizing in connection with the formation of a great world church.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.360]   It's been occupying attention ever since the end of the last war and even before that,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.780]   but particularly since the end of the last war and the first gathering of the World Council
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.440]   of Churches in Amsterdam in 1748.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.860]   And so much of the time and the energy of the church is being given and is being spent
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.360]   in discussing and preaching about this great question of church unity, ecumenicity, and
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   so on.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.160]   But it does seem to me that before we start talking about uniting churches, we ought to
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.620]   be clear in our mind as to what a church is.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.680]   And so much of the confusion today seems to me to arise from our failure to start with
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.400]   a doctrine of the church itself.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.300]   Another good reason for considering this doctrine is that it seems to me that in connection
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.520]   with the whole problem of evangelism, this should come first.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.960]   The unit of evangelism in the New Testament was the church, and that has been the case
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   throughout the centuries.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:53.320]   But there is a tendency today to think of evangelism in terms outside the local church,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.780]   and I think this has been very harmful and detrimental to the true life of the church.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.100]   So if we are concerned about evangelism, we must consider this doctrine.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.820]   And then when you come to consider what is undoubtedly the greatest need of all in the
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:19.940]   Christian Church today, namely the need of revival, this doctrine becomes quite crucial.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:29.640]   Because surely the Holy Spirit will not and cannot honor anything except his own truth.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.020]   And while the church is uncertain about that truth, there is very little value in her prayers
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.000]   and very little power in her prayers.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.300]   So these are obvious practical reasons why we should be considering together the doctrine
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.220]   of the nature of the Christian Church.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.580]   But over and above all these considerations is the fact that the New Testament itself
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.460]   gives such great prominence to this doctrine.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.580]   There is a sense in which it is true to say that every single New Testament epistle is
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.300]   rarely concerned with the doctrine of the nature of the church.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.820]   Most of the difficulties that arose in the early church were due to the fact that there
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.020]   was failure on the part of the people to realize this particular doctrine.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.260]   Take for instance, let me give you but one example, the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.180]   There is what you may call an omnibus kind of letter, a letter that deals with a variety
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.020]   of different problems that have arisen in the church, and the apostle deals with them.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.580]   But what he really says is this, that there was only one cause for all the problems.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.620]   It was the failure to realize the nature of the church.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.260]   Look at that first problem he takes up at once.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.000]   The church was divided into groups and factions which had formed themselves around the personalities
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.940]   of certain preachers.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.320]   One said, "I am of Paul, I am of Apollos," says another, "I am of Cephas," says the third,
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.320]   and so on.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.940]   What was the cause of that?
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.860]   It was, says the apostle, that they never realized that the church is the body of Christ.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.300]   Is Christ divided, he says?
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.940]   Were you baptized in the name of Paul?
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.180]   They would have been incapable of these factions if they had realized the true nature of the
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.180]   church.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.980]   And he goes on to deal with many other problems.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.460]   That incestuous person is dealing with that, is the same.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.340]   He says, "No, we not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:54.340]   The church is like a loaf, or a mass of dough with leaven in it, and if you get this evil
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.100]   in it, it will permeate the whole life because of the nature of the Christian church.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.980]   Then he goes on to show how they were quarreling with one another and even taking their quarrels
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.060]   to the public law courts.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.220]   And he's astonished at this.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.060]   He says, "You don't seem to realize what a church is.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.700]   Why don't you appoint one of the loveliest members of the church and ask him to take
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.500]   a decision in these matters?"
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.260]   Then he goes on to deal with the questions of unconverted husbands or wives and the position
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.260]   of children.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.260]   It's all the same.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.140]   And when he comes to the question of the more enlightened brethren, the stronger brethren
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.100]   and the weaker brethren, and how they were quarreling again, he deals with it in exactly
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.880]   the same way.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.380]   And hurrying on, when you come to the next question of the spiritual gifts, how they
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.080]   were vying with one another in their gifts, some boasting of more spectacular gifts and
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.700]   despising others, and the men with the lesser gifts feeling envious of the men with the
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.700]   greater gifts.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.740]   There was terrible confusion in the church, and the apostle deals with it in the same
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.740]   way.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.240]   "Ye," he says, "are the body of Christ and members in particular."
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.440]   The whole trouble was due to the fact that they'd never realized the true nature of the
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   Christian church.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   Well, now, that's just one example.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.280]   And so in all these epistles, this great doctrine is taken up because it is absolutely crucial
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   and vital.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.580]   And I have a feeling that somehow or another we've been neglecting this.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.900]   We've been talking about certain aspects without considering the vital thing itself.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:46.280]   Well, now the question is, how do we approach this question of the nature of the church?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.160]   And here there are certain important negatives I would suggest to you.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:58.380]   One fatal thing to do is just to start from where we are and to see what modifications
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:04.500]   or accommodations we can make in order to somehow arrive at a church.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.420]   Now, that's exactly what's being done by the ecumenical movement.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.220]   It starts from the present position, and then it more or less asks the different divisions
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:20.900]   to make certain modifications, perhaps even compromises, in order to produce this one
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.940]   great world church.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:30.180]   That's the policy of starting with things as they are and see what we can do with respect
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.480]   to them.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.500]   The kind of thing that is done in great businesses when for certain reasons they deem it wise
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.460]   to amalgamate together.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:47.320]   Now, I'm suggesting that that is a false way of facing this problem, and I venture to suggest
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:54.540]   also that another false way is to go back into history.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.460]   Many tend to do this at the present time.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:03.420]   Now, there is a great value in history, and we can learn a great deal from history, but
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.780]   there is a danger that if you merely go back to the origins of the different sections of
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:14.860]   the Christian church, you may end by hardening the position, and men will begin to develop
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:22.300]   a denominational spirit that is inimical to true unity, and we shall be fighting for our
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   tradition.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.380]   Now, this has happened, as you know, so frequently.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:31.100]   Nothing has been so pathetic and tragic in the history of the church as denominational
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.940]   fighting and quarreling.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.380]   The jealousy and the envy, "My church, my denomination must be better than the one down
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.060]   the street," and so on.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.700]   And so many people are quite unaware of the real truth concerning their own denomination.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.500]   They contend for it because they belong to it.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.660]   Why do they belong to it?
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.660]   Large numbers have no idea.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.380]   It's simply an accident that their parents happened to belong to it and they were brought
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.780]   up in it.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:05.260]   But this is how carnality comes in, and even history can be abused by us in this particular
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.480]   way.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.420]   We can learn from history, but we mustn't become slaves even to history.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.260]   Tradition is good.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.940]   Traditionalism is very bad.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:24.980]   So I suggest that these are false methods of approach, and even worse is one which seems
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:30.500]   to me to be creeping in very rapidly, and that is almost to be taking a kind of gallop
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.080]   poll as to what the people want.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.060]   This has become quite prominent in recent years.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.140]   The church seems to be asking, "What does the modern man want?
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.280]   What does he like?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.740]   What does he think?"
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:48.240]   And he is to determine exactly what we do, and we pander to him.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.540]   We say that he doesn't like much preaching, so we'll preach shorter sermons to him, but
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.340]   if he does like more of something else, we give him more of that.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:03.980]   The church allows the world and/or the pew, perhaps, to determine what is to be the truth.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.040]   Now, all these, surely, are quite wrong.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.060]   There's only one thing to do as we face this issue, and that is to go back to the New Testament
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.740]   itself.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:21.820]   It is here and here alone we will really discover what the Christian church is.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:28.940]   There is this fatal tendency in all of us to turn that which is true into something
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.500]   that is false.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.140]   I never shall forget, as long as I live, a phrase I once read in a little book by the
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.260]   late Dean Ng, of all men, the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.220]   He wrote a little book on Protestantism.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.340]   I've forgotten everything in the book except the first sentence, and this was the first
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:54.560]   sentence, "Every institution tends to produce its opposite."
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.300]   And his whole thesis, of course, was this, that even Protestantism by now has become
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.100]   something which is almost a negation of Protestantism.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:09.140]   And if you analyze the life and the history of the great denominations, you'll find that
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.180]   this is true of practically all of them.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.140]   They have become something that is almost the exact opposite of what the founders believed
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.080]   in and what the founders did.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:27.740]   So I say that it is our abandoned duty to go back to the New Testament itself.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.900]   And let's go right back to the beginning.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.100]   My dear friends, there is nothing more important than this at this moment.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.940]   What is a church?
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.700]   What is the church?
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.340]   And the only authoritative answer we've got to this question is that which we find in
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.820]   the New Testament, and here in particular in this second chapter of the book of Acts,
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:55.380]   we have the account of the origin of the Christian church as we know her.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.000]   This is what the church is meant to be.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.660]   This is what the church has always become in periods of reformation and of revival.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.900]   It is a trite commonplace to say that every period of true revival and reawakening is
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.460]   nothing but a return to the condition of the book of the Acts of the apostles.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.740]   And as I see things at the present time, the only hope for the church is to get back to
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.180]   this.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.780]   And the only hope for the world that is hurtling itself to hell outside is that the church
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:33.340]   should again become what she was at the beginning and in her origin.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.900]   And so I invite you this evening to look at this picture with me.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.900]   What is a church?
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:46.620]   Well, the first thing we've got to say is this, that it's obviously a gathering of people.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.620]   That seems to be a very obvious remark.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.620]   Why do I make it?
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.020]   Well, I make it for this reason.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:59.820]   That as I read some of the journals, particularly at the present time, and some of the books
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:05.260]   and booklets that deal with this whole question, I'm almost given the impression that some
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.220]   people seem to think of the church not in terms of people at all.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.260]   Some people seem to me to think of a church as something which is written on paper.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.020]   They seem to think of the church as a confession on paper.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.220]   Now, I'm not criticizing confessions.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.540]   I believe in confessions.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.940]   But a church, after all, is not a confession of faith.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.040]   I'm referring to the argument that one so frequently hears at the present time.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.500]   People are concerned about the state of the church.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:42.140]   They say, "Well, as long as my church holds to this confession, I'm going to stay in her."
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.260]   They don't seem to be concerned about the fact that more than half the people in the
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:52.040]   church, and sometimes even up to 90 percent and more, no longer believe the confession.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.380]   That doesn't seem to trouble them.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.880]   The church has become a confession on paper.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.720]   But maybe you're friends, that's wrong.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.900]   The church is a collection of people, a gathering of people.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:11.820]   And this is quite basic and vital to our whole consideration.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.460]   And therefore, we must look at these people as we see them here gathered together in the
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.900]   early church.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.460]   What was this gathering of people?
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.400]   The world has its gatherings of people.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.620]   The world often meets together in various ways.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.620]   But there's something unique about this gathering that we read of in this second chapter of
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.620]   Acts.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:41.220]   There is always something unique about the gathering of people constituting a Christian
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.220]   church.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.540]   There's nothing else in the world that is comparable to this.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   You can analyze other meetings and you can understand them and you can explain them.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.640]   But there is always something about the church that eludes us.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:03.700]   There is something living, something vital that no other kind of gathering is ever aware
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.700]   of.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.160]   Well, now, what is the great characteristic of these people?
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.280]   Well, it's clearly this.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.340]   These are people that have undergone a very great change.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.340]   They gather together.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.840]   We are given these descriptions of them.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.920]   What brings them together?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.880]   What is this unique thing that unites them and brings them together?
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.320]   The answer is that they've undergone a very great change.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.280]   Go back in your mind and in your imagination to this day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.600]   That astonishing thing happened.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.720]   The Holy Ghost descended upon those people in the upper room and they began to speak
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.360]   in other tongues.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.200]   They were filled with the Holy Ghost and they became a phenomenon and people gathered together
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.680]   from everywhere to see them.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.020]   Some thought they were drunk, filled with new wine.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:58.240]   Then Peter got up and he preached the great sermon, most of which was read to us in the
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.920]   reading at the beginning.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.880]   And as he was preaching, something happened to some of these people.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:13.120]   And they were the ones who were added to the original 120 and became the Christian church.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   What happened to them?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.600]   Well, what happened to them was the direct result of the preaching of the Apostle under
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.080]   the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.240]   What did happen to them?
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:33.120]   Well, the record tells us, as they heard these things, when they heard this, they were pricked
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:43.040]   in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, "Men and brethren,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.280]   what shall we do?"
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.640]   The church, I say, is a gathering of people.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.040]   What sort of people are they?
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:56.320]   They are the people who have undergone this profound change as a result of listening to
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.480]   this apostolic preaching.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480]   What has happened to them?
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:07.680]   Well, they have become aware of the fact that this message is speaking to them directly.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.160]   These are not people who decided to join a church.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.720]   They didn't decide to take up religion.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320]   These are people who are called of God.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.120]   The promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off, even as many
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.440]   as the Lord our God shall call.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.760]   The church is a gathering of people who are aware that God has called them.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.760]   What does that mean?
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.480]   Well, I don't want to go into the theology of this, this is not the occasion to do that.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.960]   But they are aware of what is called an effectual call.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.760]   They hear the message, yes, but they not merely hear it, they hear it in a very personal sense.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   They realize that it's speaking to them directly.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.880]   It's not something that you can listen to in a detached manner.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.020]   It is speaking to their own souls.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's making them think.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.240]   It makes them see that they're wrong.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.700]   They become troubled about their souls.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.720]   They become concerned about their eternal future.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   They're pricked in their hearts.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.280]   They undergo conviction of sin.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.520]   My dear friend, you can't be a Christian, you can't be a member of the Christian church
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.200]   unless you know something about conviction of sin.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.320]   Do we all know conviction of sin?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.660]   Hasn't there been a tendency amongst us to be taken even into the membership of the Christian
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:38.720]   church without knowing anything whatsoever about conviction of sin?
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.160]   I say to my own shame but to the glory of God that I was received as a member of the
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.920]   Presbyterian church of Wales without having any notion whatsoever as to what a Christian
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   was.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.000]   I'd never known any conviction of sin and I wasn't even questioned about it.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.560]   I wasn't aware that God had ever dealt with me.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:07.100]   This is so common and that is why things are as they are but these people have been convicted
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   of their sin.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.640]   They're in terrible trouble.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:16.120]   They cry out in their agony, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.340]   This is the thing that has happened to these people.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.180]   They're aware that God the Holy Ghost is dealing with them and they've been brought face to
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.600]   face with themselves.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.760]   They've seen the enormity of their attitude to the Lord Jesus Christ who had recently
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.400]   been crucified and put to death and ridiculed and condemned.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:43.360]   They're in this agony of soul and they cry out for help and Peter gives them the help.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:51.440]   "What shall we do?" they say and Peter replies saying, "Repent and be baptized every one
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.200]   of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins."
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:05.120]   And they believed him because we are told here that as many they that gladly received
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.600]   his word were baptized.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.280]   Not only are they convinced and convicted of their sin, they repent, they acknowledged
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:20.880]   it, they confessed it to God, they believed his message concerning the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.880]   and they began to rejoice in it and to feel happiness in it as they did so.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:35.600]   Now, what is obvious is this, isn't it, that these people have undergone a profound change.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.080]   They were not the same people as they were when they left their homes or their lodgings
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.520]   that morning to go and listen to these strange men to whom this amazing thing had happened.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.840]   They became different men and women.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:56.740]   Something had happened to them that had made them new people and so they joined the church.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.880]   This meant, of course, to many of them as Jews that they would be ostracized by their
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:08.320]   families, cut out of the family book, hated and reviled and persecuted.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.600]   We know that this happened to them, but that didn't trouble them.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   Why not?
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.640]   Because of this great change that had taken place in them.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.520]   They were separated from the world.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.940]   They were separated unto the gospel and unto the church.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:32.600]   Now we are told that they were added in that way unto the church daily as they came to
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   believe.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.720]   And from now on, the church became the great thing, the central thing, the biggest thing
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.280]   in their lives.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.880]   We've got an idyllic, ideal picture here of a great unity of people.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.540]   And what are we told about them?
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:55.040]   How do they manifest this new life which they have received?
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.200]   And the answer is that they did so by gathering together.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.920]   And we are told that they gathered together daily.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.880]   They continued steadfastly.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.000]   These are the characteristics of the two members of the Christian church.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:23.600]   They gather together daily, steadfastly, continuously.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:30.080]   The truth about them is not that they would attend the worship of the church once a year
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.160]   on Easter Sunday morning.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   It wasn't that they just attended now and again.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.200]   It wasn't that they attended when somebody was seriously ill in the family or when there
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.960]   had been a death or when there was a wedding or a christening or something like that.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.480]   No, no, they did this constantly and regularly.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   We don't read that the apostles had to go around visiting them and reminding them that
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.680]   they hadn't been in church recently, but that really they must be true to their membership
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.440]   and put in a more frequent appearance.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.840]   They hadn't to be whipped up and to be dragooned and wheedled, as it were, to coming into church.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   No, no.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.740]   You know, the difficulty with the early Christians was to send them home.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.720]   They wanted to spend all their time in the church.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.400]   They continued steadfastly.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.960]   They did it daily.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.680]   This was the central thing, the biggest thing in their lives.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.480]   You couldn't keep them away from it.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.000]   Why did they gather together like this?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.640]   Why did they come together day by day?
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.760]   Why couldn't you keep them, as it were, apart from one another?
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.240]   What did they come for?
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.400]   I do apologize, in a sense, for bringing in these negatives, but my dear friends, I'm
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.520]   beginning to think, you know, that these negatives are tremendously important.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.320]   What did they come together for?
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:01.360]   And let me point out to you that they did not come together to be entertained.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.040]   Nothing to me is so pathetic about the state of the church today as the increasing element
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.120]   of entertainment that has come into our services.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.440]   These people didn't come together to be entertained.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.600]   There are churches which keep going by means of clubs and institutes.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.440]   I know churches that, I mean, so-called churches that keep themselves going by whisk drives
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:32.960]   and dances and by dramatics and by various other human activities.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   That's not a church.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.360]   That's a travesty of the church.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.400]   That's the world.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.960]   The world does that, and it does it very well.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.480]   But the church has been doing this kind of thing.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.560]   But that is not what brought these people together.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.160]   They came not together to be entertained in any shape or form.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.320]   What did they come together for?
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.720]   The answer is given.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:03.320]   They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.920]   and in prayers.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.880]   Now, here's the thing, of course, that we've got to emphasize.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:16.640]   The really significant thing here is the order in which these things are put before us.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:24.760]   You notice that the first thing that is mentioned is doctrine, teaching, not fellowship.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.040]   Why do I emphasize this?
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.560]   I'm sure I needn't explain to you.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:36.600]   The whole of the ecumenical movement is based upon the teaching that fellowship comes first.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.960]   This is the basic argument.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.400]   They say don't talk about doctrine.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.160]   Doctrine always divides.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.840]   The great thing is for us to come together.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.720]   We are facing communism and materialism and a sort of scientism, and we must all come
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   together.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   It doesn't matter what we believe.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.820]   It doesn't matter whether we agree or not.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.880]   The great thing is that we should be together.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.720]   Every man who calls himself a Christian is surely to be regarded as a Christian.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.000]   And so we put fellowship first.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.280]   They say this is the thing to do.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.600]   We must work together, and then perhaps we'll begin to agree together.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.500]   I needn't waste your time.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.120]   This is the whole basis of the thinking of the ecumenical movement.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.200]   And there's only one thing to say about it.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.720]   It is a denial of what was true about the early Church.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.320]   Doctrine comes before fellowship.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.280]   And unless our fellowship is based upon doctrine, it is not Christian fellowship.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.260]   It is carnal fellowship.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.200]   It is human fellowship.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.720]   Why in the northern must this doctrine come first?
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.800]   There are many reasons for this.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:54.600]   These men, I say, had come together because the Holy Spirit had dealt with them.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:00.000]   He had convicted them of sin, as he alone can do.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.880]   Their new condition is the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:11.180]   And the Holy Spirit is known as the Spirit of Truth.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.920]   He shall not speak of himself out of himself.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.320]   He shall bring to your memory the things that I have taught you, says our blessed Lord.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.080]   He is the Spirit of Truth.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.360]   He is the teacher.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.120]   So the very being and person and nature of the Holy Spirit insists upon the fact that
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:36.100]   the doctrine must come first and is absolutely basic.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:42.520]   Not only that, salvation ultimately is the result of a knowledge of the truth.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.360]   You remember how Paul puts it to Timothy in the first epistle and in the second chapter.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.800]   It is the will of God that all men should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:01.640]   And so truth and teaching and doctrine must come into the first position.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.840]   Now let me enforce that by pointing out this.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.820]   It is only by putting truth first that you can save God yourself and the whole church
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.840]   from error and from heresy.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.280]   Here was a problem that arose at once even in the early church herself.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.840]   Certain false teachers came along.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.600]   And false teachers can be very nice men and very plausible men.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.320]   And they insinuated themselves into the life of the early church.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.040]   How do you test the truth of a teaching?
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.400]   How do you know whether something that is being said is right or wrong?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.960]   This is absolutely ascension.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.640]   And there is only one way whereby you can do so.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.680]   And that is by having an external, objective standard of truth.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.960]   You can't tell whether a man's teaching is right or wrong by the fact that a man is a
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.160]   nice man and a good man.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.040]   There are many nice and good people who are not Christians at all.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.360]   You can't tell whether a man's teaching is right simply because he is zealous and very
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.600]   active.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.680]   If you apply that test, you'll find yourself one Saturday afternoon suddenly called to
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.440]   your front door and there you'll find two young men trying to sell certain books to
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   you.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.480]   Jehovah's Witnesses or somebody like that.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.720]   They're not at the baseball match or any other kind of match.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.760]   They're giving their afternoon in their zeal and enthusiasm to calling round from house
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.400]   to house, suffering abuse and so on in order to propagate their teaching.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.000]   They're full of zeal.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.480]   The fact that a man is zealous and enthusiastic doesn't guarantee the rightness of his teaching
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   at all.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:55.160]   "Ah, but," you say, "if a man has had some great and glorious and wonderful experience,
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.080]   it must mean that his truth is right."
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.080]   No.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:04.600]   I think I pointed out on Sunday afternoon that the cults can give people experiences,
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.440]   psychology can give people experiences.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:16.000]   There is nothing so dangerous as to base the test of truth merely upon something subjective
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.800]   in men and women.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.420]   There is only one way of safety.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.240]   It is the truth as preached.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.120]   It is the apostolic doctrine.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.360]   Thank God we've got it in a written form.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.240]   We've got our New Testament, and we don't judge these things, men or movement, subjectively.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.840]   We apply the test of the scripture.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.960]   Does it conform to this, the apostles' doctrine, the apostles' teaching?
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.040]   This must always come first.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.240]   It is essential to the life and the well-being of the church, and so it happens, you see,
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:57.280]   in the long story of the church, that when you do get a reformation, or a great revival,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:03.160]   the first thing they always did was to draw up a confession of faith.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.040]   The early church was driven to draw up her creeds.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.040]   Why?
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.960]   Well, because of false teaching.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.480]   It wasn't that they just decided that they'd draw up their creeds.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:19.320]   The Athanasian Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed, as it's called, and various
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.360]   others, these things were not done for the sake of doing them.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   No, no.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.440]   The whole life of the church was in jeopardy.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.400]   The person of the Lord, the way of salvation in these matters, became such acute problems
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.640]   that the church had to meet together, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.180]   had to define the truth over and against error and heresy.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:47.920]   But you know that by today all this is not only unpopular, it's heartily disliked.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.520]   It is even described by some as not being Christian at all.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.560]   We are told we mustn't speak of heresy, you mustn't excommunicate anybody, you mustn't
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   exercise discipline.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.360]   If a man's got a good and a nice and a loving spirit, and is out to uplift his fellow men
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.960]   and women, he's a good Christian.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.880]   But my dear friends, this is not only a denial of the New Testament, it's a denial of the
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.760]   most glorious epochs in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:20.400]   And in the same way, the moment the great Protestant Reformation broke in upon the church,
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.360]   they immediately began to form these great confessions.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:31.480]   The Augsburg Confession, the Second Elvitic Confession and the First, and the Belgic Confession,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.920]   the Church of England with the 39 Articles, the Great Westminster Confession of Faith
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   in the 17th century.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:45.640]   The church in her great periods has always seen the absolute need and necessity of defining
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:53.520]   what she believes in order that wrong and error and heresy might be corrected and driven
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.160]   out of the church.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:01.540]   That is why teaching or doctrine must always come before fellowship.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:07.000]   There is nothing more dangerous to the true life of the church than the reversing of this
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.600]   order and putting fellowship before doctrine.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.400]   But, lest someone might think that I'm only preaching to ministers tonight, let me show
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.840]   you that this is also true as regards the members of the church.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:28.040]   For what we are told here is they, these people, not the apostles, these people who were added
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:34.720]   to the church, they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.920]   Why were they so anxious to have it?
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.680]   This is a great characteristic always of the true Christian and we must examine ourselves
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   by these things.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.760]   My dear friends, we are living in evil days.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.960]   We are living in terrible days.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.920]   There is only one hope for this world and that is the church and her message.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.960]   But you and I are the church and are we aware of our responsibilities and are we aware of
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.920]   the true nature of the church?
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.160]   This is no time for entertainment.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.840]   The world's on fire, I said.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:10.040]   The world is going to hell and the church must come back to this.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.880]   You and I must come back to this.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.560]   Do we conform to this picture?
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.640]   Are you as anxious to have this teaching as the early church was?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.960]   They wanted it every day.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.400]   Do you want it every day?
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   Why did they want it?
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.680]   I can tell you.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.160]   It's because of the new nature that was in them.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.280]   Look at that newborn baby.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.880]   Look at any animal that is born, young animal.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.000]   What does it do?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.880]   What's the sign of life?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.160]   The first sign of life is that it seeks for the milk.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.040]   It's instinctive.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   This is how life always expresses itself and new life in Christ Jesus always expresses
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:02.200]   itself in this desire, as Peter puts it, for the sincere milk of the Word that we may grow
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.520]   thereby.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.360]   My dear friend, you've got to examine yourself.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.580]   Have you got this desire for the Word of God?
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.240]   I find in England, I don't know what it's like in your country, I'm afraid it's the
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:21.440]   same from what I hear, that men and women no longer seem to have this taste for the
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.880]   Word of God.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.920]   I'm told that the services have only got to be about an hour and that if the sermon is
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.840]   more than 20 minutes, the minister is in trouble.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.160]   My dear friend, you are condemning yourself.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.360]   Are you tired of the preaching of this Word?
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.600]   Do you want to get it over as quickly as possible?
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.360]   Do you want to get more entertainment and less preaching?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.160]   If so, you are just proclaiming that you are not like the members of the early church.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.320]   You are not like the members of the church in any period of reformation or revival.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.680]   Read the great story of even those groups of people before the Protestant Reformation,
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:04.840]   the Waldensians in northern Italy, the brethren of the common life in Moravia and Bohemia
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   and in parts of Holland.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.240]   These men would meet in caves in order to be safe.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240]   What for?
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.640]   To study the Word of God and to pray about it.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.900]   The early Methodists, the beginning of all these great denominations.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.720]   This is how they came into being.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.760]   These people hungered and thirsted for this Word.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.240]   They could never have too much of it.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.780]   Is this true of us?
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:34.240]   This is the problem confronting the church, not some amalgamation of denominations.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.700]   That will make no difference because they will all be still the same.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.520]   But here is the vital question.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.200]   Are we like this?
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:48.900]   Are we as newborn babes desiring and thirsting for this sincere milk of the Word that we
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.640]   may grow thereby?
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.740]   The thing is inevitable.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.740]   Not only that.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.360]   Look at it like this.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:01.220]   These people, you see, had realized that their former position and their former way of life
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.180]   was due entirely to their ignorance.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.920]   They did not know.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.580]   It was the preaching of Peter that had enlightened them.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.460]   It was the teaching of Peter's sermon that enlightened them.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:17.020]   And so they now realize that the greatest enemy of men is ignorance.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.260]   They said we never knew we'd got a soul.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.220]   We never stopped to consider that.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.040]   We never considered our true relationship to God.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.300]   We never faced the fact of death and eternal judgment.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.460]   But now they're awakened to all this and they say we must acquaint ourselves with all
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.100]   this.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.600]   Ignorance being the great enemy.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.400]   They must have the knowledge and the information.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.000]   And they said we can never get enough of this.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.560]   Let's have more and more of it.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.760]   But oh, I'll give you a still better reason as to why they continued steadfastly in the
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.400]   Apostles' doctrine.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:54.280]   They wanted to hear more about these wonderful things.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.640]   Having realized the truth about themselves, they realized from the preaching of Peter
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:05.080]   how God had planned this great act of redemption before the foundation of the world.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.840]   Do you remember how he puts it?
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.520]   He's referring to Jesus Christ and he says him being delivered by the determinate counsel
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.080]   and foreknowledge of God.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:21.880]   He'd introduced them to this great plan of salvation, this great scheme of redemption
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   worked out by God before the very foundation of the world and how he'd brought it apast
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.160]   the story of the Old Testament, the call of Abram, the development of the message, and
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.320]   finally when the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his son made of a woman
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.880]   made under the law and then the amazing fact of the cross and the death.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.920]   Oh, these glorious things.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.120]   They said we'll never hear enough about these.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.520]   Tell us more about them.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.920]   They continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   and prayer.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.400]   Are you tired of hearing the message of the cross?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.880]   Do you think you know all about it?
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   Have you no need of further instruction?
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.720]   Don't you rejoice to hear about these things?
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:11.740]   The great plan in all its fullness and in all its glorious coherence.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:18.360]   These things are inevitable and a man who doesn't want more of this teaching is a man
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:25.840]   who really, I would suggest, has never really understood the teaching at all.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.320]   This is a sign of life.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.560]   It's inevitable.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:37.120]   And then another reason for their desiring further teaching was this.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.880]   They were concerned about their relatives and their friends.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   They'd had this new experience.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   They were born again.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.440]   They were new men in Christ Jesus.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   They know their sins are forgiven.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.440]   They're children of God.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:57.160]   But their relatives, their friends, their loved ones, their dear ones, they're still
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.920]   in the old darkness, in the old ignorance, and they want to help them.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.880]   How can they help them?
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.520]   What if they go to them and say, "Look here, you see, I'm different.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.280]   I've had a wonderful change.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.920]   I wish you had it as well."
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.600]   "It's all right," says the brother or the sister or the husband or the wife.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.880]   The Christian scientists said that to me yesterday or a Mormon said that to me.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.360]   You see, they've had marvelous experiences.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.760]   It's all right, and they won't listen.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.000]   If you really want to help your loved ones, you've got to know the truth.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   As Peter, this same man, puts it later when he writes his first epistle and in chapter
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:40.360]   three, "Be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.760]   Can you explain the way of salvation to another?
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.520]   Can you give an account of why you are what you are?
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.920]   You can't do that unless you've attended upon the apostolic teaching.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.400]   Without instruction, you can't do it.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   So it is essential if you want to help your loved ones and your dear ones and your friends.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.960]   Indeed, it is a command.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:08.400]   We are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.680]   Do we grow year by year?
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.420]   Look back ten years.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   Do you know more?
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.400]   Have you grown in grace during the last ten years?
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.840]   This is the characteristic of the Church, the true members of the Christian Church.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:29.400]   So you see that for all these reasons, teaching and doctrine must have the preeminence, the
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.660]   precedence, the priority.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.480]   They must always come in the first position.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:42.680]   The Church is here as the pillar and the ground of the truth, holding it before men.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:48.280]   We are like lights in the heavens, says Paul to the Philippians, holding forth the word
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:53.040]   of life in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.440]   And if ever that was true, it is true at this present time.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.840]   I mustn't take time this evening to point out to you that this is a very definite and
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.860]   a very specific teaching, the apostles' teaching.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.520]   They all taught the same thing, even Paul who comes in later, he's always a pains to
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.400]   point out that what he preached is what the others preached also.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:25.280]   He's come in as a kind of a topic, as one born out of due time, but it's the same message.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.520]   It's the universal message of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.280]   There's nothing vague about it, nothing indefinite.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.280]   It's discreet.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.000]   I hope to develop that on a subsequent evening.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.720]   So here, you see, we must put in this first position the desire for this apostolic teaching
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.080]   and doctrine.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:56.120]   And then, and then only, and on the basis of that, comes fellowship.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.380]   And of course the fellowship is something that does follow of necessity.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.540]   We say, don't we, that birds of a feather flock together.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.980]   Of course they do.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:12.540]   Like people are attracted by like and they like to be together.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:20.600]   We know that we have passed from death to life, says John, because we love the brethren.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.820]   Because we'd sooner be with the people of God than the greatest in the universe were
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.040]   not Christians.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040]   Why?
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:33.020]   All because we are sharers together of the same life.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.520]   We belong together.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.220]   We belong to the same family.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.420]   We've got the same blood in us.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.460]   We've got the same nature in us.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:48.980]   We are partakers together of the divine nature, as Peter puts it in his second epistle again.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:54.100]   But not only that, you see, we are sharers of certain things in common.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.220]   We've undergone the same experience.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:03.060]   We realize that we were sinners, hopeless, helpless, damned sinners, that we were saved
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.260]   alone by the grace of God.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.540]   We've been born anew.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:12.460]   We've got new desires and we've all got the same desires.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.580]   We've got the same interests.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:24.380]   We've got the same hope, the hope of glory, and we all are serving the same great Lord
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:31.100]   and Master and following the one and only leader.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.540]   That's why they continued in the fellowship.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.300]   They liked being together.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.220]   They liked to talk about these things.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.980]   You know, this has always been characteristic of Christian people.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.900]   Do you remember the story of the conversion of John Bunyan, the old tinker of Bedford
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.900]   in the 17th century?
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.460]   John Bunyan tells us in his account of it in Grace Abounding, that one of the things
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.180]   that helped him above everything else was this.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.900]   He was there under terrible conviction of sin for 18 months and he was almost being
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:09.460]   driven to despair, but one day he was standing in a street in Bedford and he happened to
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:15.580]   see three poor old women sitting in the sun and knitting and talking together and they
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:22.140]   were talking together about the things of God and they were enjoying themselves.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.740]   They were having fellowship together in this experience that they were sharing together
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.620]   and this knowledge that they had together and John Bunyan saw that's the thing I want
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:38.140]   or that I could belong to them and he spoke to them and they were able to help him.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.380]   This is inevitable.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:44.140]   The fellowship comes out of this common teaching and common experience.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:49.060]   I mustn't keep you with the breaking of bread.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.920]   This means the communion of the Lord's Supper.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.380]   They like to declare his death till he came.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:04.780]   They like to remind themselves of how they owed everything to that.
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:11.140]   Breaking of bread, they did actually have communal meals as well, but they celebrated
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.140]   his death.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:16.900]   He'd commended the church to do this and they did it very gladly and they rejoiced in it
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   together.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:24.220]   They were one loaf as Paul puts it in writing to those Corinthians and so they rejoiced
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:32.700]   in declaring his death until he come and then in prayer.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:37.300]   The old preachers always used to say that the way to test the church was to examine
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.580]   its prayer meeting.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:45.900]   They said that's the powerhouse, that's the thermometer by which you can measure the warmth
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.960]   of the life of a church, the character of a prayer meeting.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:58.500]   My dear friends, I don't know so I'm a stranger and I can ask questions without being offensive.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:02.620]   What are the prayer meetings like in your churches?
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.300]   Are they powerhouses?
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.460]   Do you meet together to pray?
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.820]   Pray what for?
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.460]   Pray for your preacher, pray for your pastor, pray for your minister.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:20.300]   Here is a man weak in the flesh as we've been reminded this evening having this treasure
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.380]   in earthen vessels.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:28.060]   Do you pray for him regularly week by week that the Holy Ghost may come upon him?
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:33.980]   I have a fear you know that people are beginning to think that only certain people can evangelize
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.940]   and they'll prepare for some special effort.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.300]   But do you pray daily and week by week for your own minister?
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.660]   The Spirit can come upon him at any moment, do you pray that it may do so?
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.980]   It's the only hope.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:52.340]   We need revival, we need a Holy Ghost power upon us, nothing will avail us until we get
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.340]   it.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.120]   Are you praying for it?
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.360]   These people realize the need of the strength.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.380]   Peter, his men who've just been preaching, he was only a fisherman.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:06.160]   They knew that he needed strength, they all needed strength.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.200]   And they were confronted by enemies and they knew that nothing but the power of God could
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.540]   authenticate this message and do this blessed work.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.240]   So they spent their time not only in listening to the teaching and in the fellowship and
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.720]   the breaking of bread, but in prayers.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:29.240]   Young people, do you realize your responsibility at this dread hour?
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.320]   We can all pray, we're all called to pray.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.800]   Do we feel the burden, are we conscious of this anxiety?
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:43.880]   It's not enough just to bemoan the evil state of the church and to condemn these poor unfortunate
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.040]   young people and others who are outside, that's not going to save anybody.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   There is only one thing that will save, that the power that came upon Peter and the rest
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:58.760]   on the day of Pentecost shall come upon us again and we'll know blessed revival, Holy
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:06.360]   Ghost power, and the word will go out with energy and force that is irresistible.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:10.560]   But your prayers are necessary.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.720]   That is the character of the early church.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:20.620]   I mustn't keep you, but I must mention just one other thing we are told about these people
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:29.400]   at the end of the passage, listen, "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:37.960]   and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:46.520]   of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:54.000]   And the result of that was the Lord added to the church daily such as should or were
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   being saved."
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.720]   I am simply emphasizing this, the joy and the gladness.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.360]   Is it evident amongst us?
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.400]   Why are the masses of the people outside the Christian church?
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.840]   Why is the church and the preaching of the gospel so ineffective at the present time?
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.040]   I think I can tell you.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:24.520]   Indeed, the man who's outside will tell you.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.720]   This is what he tells you.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.100]   He calls us miserable Christians.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.880]   Why doesn't he come to us?
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.160]   He says he doesn't come to us because he doesn't want to be miserable.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:42.320]   We give the impression, so many of us, that we still go to church largely because, perhaps
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.560]   we promised a saintly father or mother that we'd do so.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.040]   We often seem very reluctant to do so.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.760]   If we go once every Sunday, we deserve a medal.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.840]   This is wonderful.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.560]   We're making a great sacrifice.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.920]   That's the impression we are giving to people.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.440]   It's against the grain.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:07.960]   It's a duty, and we're doing it as a matter of duty.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.520]   It's not surprising that the people are outside.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.200]   Do you know what will bring the people inside?
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:21.940]   It is when you and I are filled with this joy and gladness.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:28.400]   It's an evil world that we're living in, and the pleasure mania and the drug taking and
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:34.640]   all the rest of it are simply a confession that men and women are afraid to face life.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:41.040]   They're defeated, they're hopeless, and if we give the impression that we're just sad
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:47.800]   and plumb and doing it as a matter of tradition or of duty, they'll pay no attention to us.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:53.680]   But you know, when they see that we are men and women who've got a joy unspeakable and
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:00.360]   full of glory, when they see that in the same world as themselves, we've got something in
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:06.320]   us that fills us with a thrill and an exaltation, they'll rush to us.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.680]   Let me give you a great example of this from history.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.960]   Do you know it was something like that that more or less led to the conversion of John
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   Wesley?
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.340]   Have you ever read the story of Wesley?
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.360]   He was crossing the Atlantic, you remember, from England to come over here and back, and
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   on one of the occasions, his first occasion, a great storm blew up mid-Atlantic.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.960]   And they were all convinced that the poor little ship was going to go down.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:42.200]   But on board the same ship as Wesley, there was a little group of Moravian brethren.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.000]   Wesley had been observing them, that they met together and were having their prayers,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.680]   and they'd sing their hymns, and they seemed to be filled with a spirit of joy.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   But now the terrible storm came, and Wesley was alarmed, he wasn't ready to die, he was
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.000]   afraid, he didn't know what to do.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.960]   So he thought he'd go and have a look at these Moravian brethren, and to his utter amazement
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.440]   and astonishment, they remained unchanged.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.760]   The storm didn't change them.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:14.280]   They were still filled with a spirit of joy and rejoicing, of gladness and of hymn singing.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.480]   They could sing in the storm exactly in the same way as they could in the calm.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:25.160]   My dear good friends, this has always been the characteristic of the true church.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:30.560]   And when she becomes like this, she acts as a magnet to those who are outside.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:36.160]   When men and women see us, I say, with this spirit of joy and rejoicing, this spirit that
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:42.360]   is invincible, this spirit that knows it's God and is afraid of nothing, they'll rush
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.760]   to listen to us.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:50.480]   Joy and rejoicing, how much of it is there to be seen amongst us?
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:57.560]   How formal we are, how organized we are, how set we are, and the world isn't interested.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:05.000]   But when it sees this joy of the Lord and this invincible spirit in us, it will come
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.680]   and listen to us and ask us to give them the secret of this amazing experience that we
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.960]   are enjoying, and lastly, the praising of God.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.360]   How much of this is there manifest amongst us?
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.600]   I don't mean organized, artificial praising.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:31.480]   I mean a praising that wells up out of the heart, thanking God that he's ever looked
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:38.160]   upon me, the worst of sinners, crying out with Charles Wesley, and can it be that I
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.600]   should gain an interest in the Savior's blood?
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:52.160]   Died he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued, amazing love.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:56:01.120]   It's almost impossible that he should ever have looked upon me, the Son of God that loved
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:08.520]   me and gave himself for me, praising God.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:17.880]   My dear friends, this is the great need of the hour, not merely to perpetuate a denomination
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:25.120]   or an organization or an institution, no, no, but to become the living church of Christ,
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:33.000]   filled with his life and power, charged with the energy of the Spirit divine, and standing
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   as a phenomenon in this modern evil world, but pointing to the way of salvation and enabling
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:53.120]   men and women to see that what has happened to us can likewise happen to them.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:57:04.920]   Oh, may God have mercy upon us and awaken us out of our formalism and our lethargy,
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:16.280]   and give us no rest nor peace until we come to know him and rejoice in glory in him and
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:22.560]   be filled with his Spirit, the promise is unto you and to your children and to as many
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:31.400]   as are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:40.800]   Let us make certain that we've been called, that we know him in whom we have believed,
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:51.040]   that we live for him if needs be, that we are ready to die for him, that in him we know
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:55.760]   that we are always safe and secure.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.400]   Let us pray.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:09.880]   Oh, Lord our God, have mercy upon us, we humbly pray thee, that we find ourselves so far removed
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.520]   from this picture of thy people in the early church.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:22.080]   Oh, God, have mercy upon us, come, we humbly pray thee, in the power of thy blessed Spirit
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   and awaken us, convince us of our sin and lead to Jesus' blood, humble us, oh Lord,
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:40.960]   and break us and bend us, take from us our complacency, our self-satisfaction, and make
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:48.480]   of us a people who know their God, the people of whom he will not be ashamed to be called
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   their God.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:59:00.120]   Oh, Lord, revive thy work, make bare thine almighty arm, and do a new work in the midst
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:07.320]   of this evil and perverse generation in which we find ourselves.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:14.040]   And unto thee, and unto thee alone, shall we give the praise, the honor, and the glory,
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.700]   forever and forever, amen.
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:21.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
