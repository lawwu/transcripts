[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   This week comes to an end and it has been a fruitful one with author and speaker Dr.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.760]   Paul David Tripp filling in for John Piper who returns with us on Monday.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.040]   Paul is the author of the book "Awe, Why It Matters for Everything We Think, Say and
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.400]   Do" which easily made my top 10 best books of 2015 list.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.640]   And this week we talked about awe and how it really does in fact relate to everything
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.960]   we do including spiritual growth and ministry aims and weight loss attempts, parenting methods
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.280]   and now we're going to talk about our expectations when it comes to marriage.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.960]   Paul in my research into the pastoral letters of 18th century pastor John Newton, I was
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.560]   surprised how often he wrote to newlyweds to warn them about avoiding making their spouse
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.740]   into an idol of security.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.620]   Over and over in his letters he does this and I think partly because he experienced
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.240]   it in his own marriage which was an incredible love story in and of itself.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   But the same concern lives on today through ministries like that of Tim and Kathy Keller
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.080]   who see that there's just this consuming fascination with romantic love in our culture and it shapes
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.360]   much of the popular media that we consume as well.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.320]   The lie goes like this, if you find romantic love then your life will be safe and fulfilling.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   So much so that marriage becomes almost a type of salvation and romantic love takes
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.700]   on an almost redemptive expectation.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.560]   So what would you say to Christians, either singles or newlyweds who are in danger of
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.960]   losing all in God by becoming preoccupied with romantic love?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.200]   Well the first thing I would say to them is that romance is never the cause of a good
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   marriage.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.240]   Now I am by nature a very romantic man, I like romance.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.320]   But romance is actually the result of a good marriage.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.160]   And if you look to romance to form for you a good marriage you're going to be freaked
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.680]   out, discouraged, disappointed, ultimately hopeless human being.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   Because here's why, what is a biblical view of marriage?
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.120]   It's a flawed person married to a flawed person in a fallen world, are you encouraged
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   yet?
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.800]   But with a faithful God.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.920]   And so I'm never going to have paradise in my marriage, paradise is to come.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.440]   I'm never married to a perfect person, that person will never be my Messiah, the person
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'm married to has no capacity whatsoever to change my heart, that person I'm married
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.240]   to has no capacity whatsoever to bring satisfaction and contentment to my heart, they have no
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.960]   ability whatsoever to deliver me from my sin, they just have no ability to do any of that.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:20.440]   And so a good marriage is a good marriage because people in that marriage realize they
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.660]   are not the Messiah to one another.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.320]   But they don't panic because they've been given an adequate and sufficient Messiah who
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.760]   invades marriage by His grace and gives us everything we need to be where we're supposed
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.320]   to be and to do what we're supposed to do in marriage.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   Here's what this means, and sort of a bottom line, you never get your capacity to love
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.720]   from the person you were called to love.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.960]   You never get your capacity to love from your spouse, you get your capacity to love at the
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.360]   foot of the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, you have it, it's God's gift of grace to you.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.320]   And so you don't need to look to the other person for what you've already been given
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   in Christ.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   Amen.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.020]   Specifically, what would you say to a single Christian whose loneliness feels more real
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.400]   to them than God's presence does?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:37.120]   Well, my response to someone who is just overwhelmed by any human experience, whether it's singleness
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.240]   or sickness or poverty, is to examine your meditation.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   It tends to be that whatever controls my meditation will dominate my thinking and reformulate
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.680]   my desires.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.000]   And so that's why there's a biblical call to meditate on the things of the Lord, to
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.520]   meditate, actually, on God Himself.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.080]   What I would say is biblical faith never calls you to deny reality.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.400]   If you have to deny reality to get peace, you're not exercising biblical faith.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   But if you allow yourself to meditate on the troubling realities of the fallen world, you're
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.680]   going down.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   And so you face those realities, but you meditate on God's glory.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.480]   And in that way, you can be free from being overwhelmed.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.680]   Well, we must end the week there.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.880]   And I could talk about God's glory forever, which is what we will do forever.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.280]   But for now, we must end the week.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.040]   And as we do, I'm reminded of what C.S. Lewis once wrote about joy.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:58.640]   Lewis said this, "All joy emphasizes our pilgrim status, always reminds, beckons, awakens,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.560]   and desires, our best havings," he wrote, "our wantings."
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.760]   In a sense, our deepest joys in this life are a sense of our wantings.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.000]   And you close the awe book by talking about awe as a longing.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.760]   In a real sense, even in our awe, there is something unsatisfied at the end of the day,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.120]   a sort of longing that remains.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.080]   Maybe we should close here.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   Explain this phenomenon.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.960]   Well, I think we were all hardwired for eternity.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:40.120]   And I think that means that every moment of sadness, disappointment, hurt, or fear is
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.420]   a cry for another better world.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:07:03.340]   Every moment of joy, happiness, and peace is a taste for another world.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.940]   And that longing for paradise is at the center a longing for God.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.140]   I love saying this.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:21.100]   Paradise will be paradise because God will be in the middle of it forever unchallenged.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.300]   That's what we're longing for.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:30.420]   And every day, in some way, as I face the brokenness inside of me and the brokenness
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.540]   outside of me, whether I know it or not, I cry out for eternity.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:48.020]   The awes of today are drawing us toward that moment when we will live in unbroken awe of
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.700]   God forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:59.020]   And 10 million years into eternity, there will be no lessening of that awe.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020]   Yes.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   Amen.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.300]   This is a great place to end for now, Paul.
