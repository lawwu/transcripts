[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.020]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, episode number 10.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.000]   Today we have a special program.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.020]   We're going to look at index investing and
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.860]   exchange traded funds around the world with two special guests,
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.180]   Robin Powell and Debbie Fure.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:37.180]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.380]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry and this is Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.300]   This episode is sponsored by the John C.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.500]   Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.660]   We have a special program today.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.060]   We're going to be looking at the growth of index investing and
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.540]   ETF investing around the globe.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.220]   And I have two special guests, Robin Powell, who is an award-winning journalist
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.660]   and the creator of the Evidence-Based Investor website.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.000]   And Debbie Fure, who is the managing partner and
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.240]   founder of ETFGI, the world's leading independent ETF research firm.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   First up is Robin Powell.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.780]   Welcome, Robin.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.420]   >> Rick, it is a real honor to be on the podcast.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.960]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.560]   >> Well, thank you.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.160]   And the reason I wanted you on the podcast is because you're going to tell us
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.880]   all about the growth of indexing in Europe.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.600]   You have been an incredible advocate and growth factor to educate investors and
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.160]   advisors in Europe about index investing.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.760]   Your passion for indexing came from an unusual place.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.120]   You were a mainstream journalist and worked at news services.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.160]   And you were also doing documentaries.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.400]   How did you go from that to becoming such an advocate?
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.880]   >> I've been a journalist all my career.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.560]   In fact, still consider myself to be a journalist.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.920]   I still work as a freelance.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.520]   I was a general news reporter, mainly in television for ITV, Sky News,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.840]   a little bit for the BBC.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.800]   It took me to some fascinating places, Baghdad under Saddam Hussein.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.720]   I was one of the first journalists to really report on
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.360]   what was happening at Guantanamo Bay and had some really interesting assignments.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720]   But of all those fascinating stories I've worked on,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.200]   I still contend that in many ways the biggest and
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.920]   most interesting story is the ongoing story that I'm working on at the moment,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.240]   which is the kind of rigging by the industry of investing.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   It's a fascinating story and I'm working full time on it now.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.240]   >> By the rigging, you mean financial firms taking advantage of investors?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.200]   >> Yes, there are people who see it as a massive conspiracy theory here.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   That the industry, rather like, I suppose, big tobacco in the 60s and
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.960]   early 70s, like the fossil fuel industry, for example, used their muscle and
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:34.920]   their might to deflect consumers' attention from the academic evidence.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.960]   And I do actually think there is quite a large element of that going on.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.560]   I think just in more simple terms, you can pretty much explain
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.080]   anything that happens in economics by incentives.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.440]   If we're financially incentivized to say or
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.920]   recommend certain things, do certain things, then we will.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.560]   And I think that has just played out in the investing space.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.520]   And yeah, it's got to a stage around the world where really,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.800]   the whole system is geared for the benefit of the people who work in it,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   rather than the people they're supposed to be serving.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   >> A few years ago, you found out about this by doing a documentary,
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.760]   and you became hooked on it.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.600]   Can you tell us about that?
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.800]   >> Well, that's right.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.720]   It was shortly after leaving television, I set up my own production company.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.520]   And we were approached by a wealth management firm in Birmingham,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.400]   which is the city in the UK where I'm based.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.640]   And they said, look, we work mainly with high net worth clients, but
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.920]   we feel that we have found the way to invest.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.000]   And not just the way for wealthy people to invest, as I say,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.480]   they largely dealt with wealthy individuals, but for everyone to invest.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.760]   And I suppose largely as a kind of pro bono initiative,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.640]   they just wanted to get the message out there.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.200]   They thought about writing a book, but then they'd heard about what we did and
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.600]   said, well, why don't we make a documentary?
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.800]   So well, Rick, that's when I met you.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   I came out to America, interviewed a number of interesting people.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.760]   I think we met at a Bogle Heads conference in Pennsylvania.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.360]   I think that the following day, I interviewed the great Jack Bogle.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.200]   We also went to Ken French up at Dartmouth and interviewed him.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.240]   We interviewed Bill Sharp over in California.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.440]   And the documentary, I wouldn't say it bombed in the UK,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   but it was much better received in America where, of course,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.080]   you are very much more ahead of things.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.960]   And you certainly were there in terms of awareness of the benefits
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   of low cost indexing.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.320]   Here, people took one look at it and thought, what's all this about?
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   And really, it's a measure of how far we've come in the last few years
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.520]   that actually people have really started to sit up and take notice.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.920]   I remember that interview because you talked with me for maybe 15 or 20
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.760]   minutes, and I somehow picked up your accent when
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.960]   I was talking with you.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.880]   When we started interviewing, I started speaking in this strange accent.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.800]   And my wife saw that, and she said, what are you doing?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.600]   I couldn't help it.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.040]   I couldn't stop talking that way.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.680]   Well, so you did the documentary.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   And like you said, it kind of bombed in the UK,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.520]   but something must have started a fire in you
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.720]   because you haven't stopped since.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:04.000]   Well, Rick, I think you have written about a moment in your career.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.680]   You referred to your aha moment of realizing that indexing
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.400]   is the way to go, if you like.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.720]   And I think I remember you writing somewhere
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.280]   that you decided at that point that that's
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.400]   what your career was going to be from now on.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.680]   That's what your mission in life, if you like, was going to be.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.320]   And I suppose I decided the same.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.760]   And I'll be honest, I was shocked.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.240]   I was shocked that there is all this academic evidence out there
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.960]   about how we should invest.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   And yet we have almost an entire industry
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.640]   which is geared up to encouraging us to do the complete opposite.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.800]   That, I suppose, bothered me.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.880]   I mean, I've always been, I suppose, a bit of a sort of campaigning
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.960]   journalist, if you like.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.160]   I've always been interested in consumer issues
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   and sticking up for consumers, sticking up for the little guy,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.440]   if you like.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.240]   Yeah, it just inspired me.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.560]   And as you say, I haven't stopped.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.720]   Now, the data is compelling in the UK for doing index investing,
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.480]   just as it is in the US, in fact, all around the world.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.200]   One of the studies that we do over here is by S&P.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.800]   Standard & Poor's does what's called the SPIVA scorecard.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.000]   And the SPIVA scorecard is published, I would say, biannually.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.920]   And it looks at the performance of active funds
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.520]   versus various indexes.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.680]   It started here in the US, but now S&P Dow Jones Indices
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.080]   does this report for a number of countries--
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.000]   Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Japan, Latin America, South Africa.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.480]   And I just want to read you a list.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.280]   This is from the latest SPIVA reports from all these different parts
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.520]   of the world.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.680]   And it happens to be just the three-year data.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.840]   In other words, over a three-year period of time,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.960]   what is the percentage of times the index--
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.320]   and they use an S&P index for all of these.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.720]   But S&P, of course, has indexes that track markets
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.680]   all over the world.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.480]   What is the percentage of the local country or regional index
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.880]   that outperformed the active managers?
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.600]   And I'm just going to read you the list.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.840]   I'm going to go straight down.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.480]   And some of these countries are small, but some of them are big.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.640]   Some of the regions are big.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:39.520]   So in the US, roughly 79% of the large cap active managers
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.440]   underperform the S&P 500, which is what they used.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.200]   In Canada over the last three years, 94%
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.600]   of the active managers underperformed.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.680]   In Mexico, 89% of active managers underperformed the local index.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.840]   In Brazil, 84%.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.000]   In Chile, 86%.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.440]   In Europe, which encompasses continental Europe and the UK,
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.080]   86%.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.360]   South Africa, 85%.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.560]   India, 91%.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.800]   Japan was the outliner.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.480]   It had only 57% of the active managers underperformed.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.080]   And Australia, 86%.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.960]   And what I found with a lot of state-of-the-art
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.080]   is you're always going to have one outlier, whereas one
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.720]   of the regions is going to be off, but 10 years from now,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.680]   it'll be different.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.840]   It'll be a different region.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.760]   So if you look at this, it's just amazing to me
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.800]   as I look at all these numbers from all of these countries,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:43.000]   it falls right about 80% to 85% of active managers
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.720]   across the board in all countries.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.400]   And as I get into the SPIVA report even more,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.120]   I look at small cap, large cap, value growth.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.960]   They're all the same numbers in every country across the board.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.760]   You raise a really interesting point, Rick.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.800]   And funnily enough, I actually made a sort of follow-up
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.080]   documentary, How to Win the Loser's Game, which
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.200]   is obviously inspired by Charlie Ellis's book
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.880]   from the mid '70s and included an extended interview
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.280]   with Eugene Farmer and various other people.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.120]   And when that went out, I had a number of people in the UK
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.400]   say, but this is all about America.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.880]   All the figures you're giving us are
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.400]   all about US fund managers, Wall Street managers.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.680]   And we all know that they're dreadful.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.280]   And I really couldn't believe what these people were saying.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.440]   I mean, I will spare their blushes,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.280]   but shall we say these are very senior executives that--
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   I remember one in particular at a very well-known FTSE 100
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   company, shall we say--
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.520]   trying to tell me that this was an American problem
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.320]   and that actually in the rest of the world,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.560]   and particularly in the UK, where we have good fund
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.120]   managers, of course, it's not an issue at all.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.280]   But clearly, as your S&P data you just quoted shows,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.720]   we're all about as bad or as good as each other, frankly.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   Sometimes big, big name managers who fall off the wagon
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.080]   help to show that active management isn't all
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.200]   that it's cracked up to be.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.480]   And you just had an example of that recently.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.680]   I mean, when I started writing about active management
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:29.240]   and the kind of randomness of active fund returns and so on,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.600]   a common retort that I would have from people in the UK
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.120]   was, what about Neil Woodford?
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.800]   Well, Neil Woodford is a very successful, very photogenic fund
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:47.080]   manager who ran a fund for Invesco Perpetual
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.000]   for many years, which was very successful, which outperformed.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.440]   Actually, when you look at it on a strictly risk and cost
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.760]   adjusted basis, the performance was not actually
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.680]   as amazing as some people imply sometimes that it is.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.920]   Notwithstanding that, it was good,
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   and it put him on a pedestal.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.480]   And he then subsequently set up his own company,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.880]   Woodford Funds, and literally almost exactly five years ago,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.680]   19th of June, 2014, he set up a fund
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.320]   called the Equity Income Fund.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.360]   It's his flagship fund.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.240]   And the performance of it, Rick, has been consistently dreadful.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.800]   It's been going down and down and down.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.000]   Things have got particularly bad in the last 12 months.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.120]   And now big investors are starting to desert it.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.080]   And lo and behold, on Monday, they
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.240]   announced that they suspended trading.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.880]   The reaction to that story in the UK is really interesting.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.000]   Everyone's saying, wow, we thought
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.600]   this guy was a genius.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.960]   What's gone on?
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.080]   He's completely lost it, which, of course, as you know,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.360]   completely misses the point that actually outperforming
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.680]   the market, outwitting the collective wisdom of millions
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.200]   of people around the world is extremely hard.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.400]   It's extremely rare.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.320]   And his chances, frankly, of ever replicating
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.880]   his performance at Invesco, at his own company,
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.280]   were always very, very slim.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.600]   And yet, everyone's acting as if it's a huge surprise.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.160]   Extraordinary.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.480]   We had a similar situation here in the US a few years ago
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.840]   with Bill Miller, who ran the Legg Mason Capital Management
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.480]   Value Trust.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   He had a fantastic track record of outperforming
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.560]   the S&P for 15 years in a row.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.160]   And he was literally the man until 2007.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.720]   And in 2007, when financial stocks started to go down,
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.040]   he started loading up.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.120]   And he bought Bear Stearns and Citigroup and AIG.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:11.320]   And by the end of 2008, his fund had lost 2/3 of its value.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.960]   And people jumped ship.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.440]   And he's still managing money now.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.400]   And I think he's doing much better
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.760]   with a much smaller fund.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   But the point is that there's always
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.880]   going to be someone who is an outliner.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.480]   Just by randomness alone, there's
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.160]   going to be a fund manager who does well.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.240]   And something that really bothers me, Rick,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.920]   is how many investors actually identified Bill Miller
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.720]   at the start of that amazing 15-year run,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   or whatever it was, or Neil Woodford at the start
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.960]   of his 20-year run.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.800]   And as you know, it's in the nature
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.160]   of high-conviction active management--
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.740]   and that's what Miller was, and it's
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.840]   what Neil Woodford is as well--
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.520]   it's in the nature of high-conviction active
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.080]   management that, at some stage, you're
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.840]   going to underperform the market horrendously.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.680]   And Woodford went through a phase
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.820]   just before the turn of the millennium--
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.560]   I think '98, '99, when he was in the papers,
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.760]   everyone was saying, this guy's completely lost it.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   That was back then.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.880]   And of course, he subsequently was proved right, if you like.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.440]   And he massively turned things around in the 2000s.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.000]   And everyone said he was a complete genius.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.680]   So everyone talks about these outliers.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.120]   But even with those outliers, how many people
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.280]   actually identified them in advance
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.120]   and stuck with them through thick and thin?
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.100]   I'm sure it's a very, very small number.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.940]   Interesting that in the UK, your equivalent
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.900]   of the Security and Exchange Commission over here,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.060]   over there it's the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.260]   regulator.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.100]   In 2017, they addressed a lot of these issues.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.420]   And a large report came out, which
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.260]   fundamentally changed how business
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.020]   is being done over there.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.900]   Yes.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.820]   So back in 2012, I think it was, we
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.980]   had something called the Retail Distribution Review.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.300]   And that effectively banned commissions
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.660]   to advisors for recommending certain mutual funds,
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.060]   if you like.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.100]   And I think we were pretty well the first country in the world
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.380]   to do it.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.860]   Netherlands was also one of the first.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.340]   And very slowly now, other countries around the world
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:33.100]   are starting to look to that kind of commission-free
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.620]   approach, if you like.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.660]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.220]   In the US, there has been no discussion about doing that.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.780]   I'm amazed and frankly appalled at some of the stories, Rick,
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:49.060]   that I hear about the conflicts going on in particularly
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.300]   the brokerage world in America.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:57.020]   In many ways, you're ahead of the game.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.860]   You're ahead of us in terms of fees.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.380]   Your fees are much lower than ours.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.300]   The awareness of poor performing active funds
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.060]   is greater in the US than anywhere else in the world.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.820]   And yet you have these horrendous conflicts,
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.140]   which, without getting political about it,
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.420]   were going to be dealt with, with the fiduciary rule.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.500]   And as you know, that hasn't materialized, or at least
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.220]   in the way that it was originally intended.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.020]   And then a couple of years ago, as you say,
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.860]   we had the report by the Financial Conduct Authority,
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.540]   the Asset Management Market Study.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.580]   And it basically found all sorts of conflicts
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.620]   of interest in the investing and asset management industry,
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.060]   really from top to bottom.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.620]   It also pointed out that after costs, very few active funds
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.100]   actually outperform the market.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.380]   I remember I was actually in America when this happened.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.460]   And I was at a conference.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   I was reading the report.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.980]   And I just could not believe what I was hearing.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.660]   Here we have the UK regulator, which, frankly,
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.540]   has been, like all regulators around the world,
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:20.060]   has been very, very slow to get on top of this whole issue
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.300]   around conflicts of interest, around opaque fund
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.940]   fees and charges.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.540]   And all of a sudden, the FCA suddenly
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.740]   seemed to have sudden kind of conversion, if you like.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.620]   And you know it's in the nature of these things
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.140]   that a report comes out.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.100]   And of course, then it's open then to put out to consultation.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.780]   And the industry then, the lobby, sets to work on it.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.300]   And the final report was actually
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.700]   rather less damning than the original report that came out.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.540]   It's exactly the same all around the world.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.740]   ESMA, the European Markets Authority,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.660]   brought out a report a few months ago.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.900]   And exactly the same thing has happened.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.300]   I mean, the US and the UK fund industry lobbies
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.520]   are no better or worse than the lobbies in France, Germany,
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.940]   all these other countries as well.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.980]   And they, too, have been working on their own regulators
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.860]   to try to hold back the tide, if you like.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.500]   But things have been going well.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.940]   I mean, you're growing.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.460]   And your role is not only to help educate the public,
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.820]   but you also help advisors to educate their clients as well.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.820]   Tell us about how things are different in the UK.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.620]   What type of messaging do you need versus--
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.080]   you work in the US as well, and you work with US advisors.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.500]   So I mean, what are the differences between the two?
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.140]   Yeah, well, I suppose the kind of rules
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.140]   are fairly similar, but both sides of the Atlantic.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.020]   Obviously, in America, you're not allowed--
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.740]   the SEC does not allow, as I understand it, Rick,
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.620]   testimonial videos and so on.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.220]   We can't do those in America.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.180]   But we can do them here, and they are very, very powerful.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.340]   We call it social proof, when people can actually
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.140]   see people like them.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.540]   I used to use active funds.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.740]   Now I use index funds.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.700]   I'm much better off.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.700]   I'm much more relaxed.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.700]   I don't worry about the markets and that sort of thing.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.940]   That's very, very effective.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.420]   It's still a very raw issue here in the UK.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.700]   I get the impression in America that people have actually now
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.300]   more or less accepted that passive is better than active.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.180]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.760]   You probably might disagree with that.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.820]   But here, it's still a burning issue,
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.620]   and I'm still very much in the minority, very much
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.860]   in the minority.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.900]   And so I find the best thing is really
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.700]   not to get into arguments with people,
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.340]   because very often, people have had
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.460]   these very deep-seated ideas.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.540]   And particularly when you're talking to other people
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.980]   in the industry as well, they've built their whole careers.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.180]   They've been doing this for 30, 40 years, some of them.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.300]   They don't want some journalist telling them
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.040]   that they've been wasting their time and, more importantly,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.520]   wasting their clients' money all of those years.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.360]   So I do think you need to be emotionally intelligent,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.480]   non-confrontational, and really just present the evidence
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.400]   in a sort of unemotional way.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.040]   And I think as far as clients are concerned,
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.240]   if you actually show them that they could end up
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:50.020]   with a retirement pot, which is 25%, 30%, even 40% bigger
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.100]   if they use low-cost index funds and, other than rebalancing,
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:23:01.660]   do nothing else, then that's quite a compelling argument.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.820]   Well, you've got some help.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.580]   There are some companies that have come into the UK recently,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.220]   like Vanguard, for example, who's really growing a presence.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.520]   And they must be marketing their information at a low fee.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.440]   That must be helping.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.040]   And I'll also make a plug for the Bogleheads forum.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.560]   Bogleheads.org, we now have an international section.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.440]   And when you click that on, we have
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.520]   at least one European country, Spain,
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.120]   which has their own forum.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.040]   It'd be nice for the UK to maybe start their forum.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.640]   Absolutely.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.800]   We'd love one, yeah.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.400]   Well, you could start it, Robin.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:34.920]   Why not?
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.720]   Why not?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.760]   And this is the voice, if you will,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.540]   of the individual investor, speaking
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.980]   with other individual investors.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.980]   And it's been very powerful here in the US,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.060]   because indexing, in many ways, has
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.740]   been a lot of word of mouth.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.540]   Because there's not a lot of money
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.820]   in this indexing industry.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.100]   So people write articles, write books.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.060]   And then there are forums, like the Bogleheads forum,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.180]   where it's investor to investor helping out.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.100]   And that's really important, Rick, isn't it?
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.740]   I mean, humans, we are very social animals.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.100]   And I think part of the reason why
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.220]   this whole active management speculating thing has just
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.980]   got completely out of control is that there
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.940]   were so many people doing it, and so many people benefiting
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.620]   from it.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.280]   Journalists, it gave them something to write about.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.580]   It gave them advertising revenue.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.900]   Analysts, obviously, they made a lot of money out of it.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.660]   Brokers, advisors, consultants.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.980]   You kind of see these people at conferences, as well.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.500]   And they all kind of get together,
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.460]   and they're all talking about the latest thing to invest in,
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.380]   or the latest fund to keep an eye on, and so on.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.280]   And actually, that's why I think Bogleheads is really, really
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:52.820]   important.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.860]   Because it's a community of like-minded people
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.260]   who've actually discovered the truth, if you like.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.020]   And sometimes, even if you have discovered the truth,
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.820]   you need to be reminded of it every now and again.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.260]   And again, that's why I think something like Bogleheads
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.940]   would be really, really valuable here in Britain.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.340]   I have a saying that I got from someplace else,
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.020]   but I don't know the source.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.500]   The truth must be repeated over and over again,
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.280]   because lies are constantly being told.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.740]   Absolutely right.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.260]   Robert, thank you for being on the show today.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.100]   I greatly appreciate your time, and good luck
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.500]   spreading the word.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.140]   Rick, it's been a real pleasure, and I've
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.620]   been a big admirer of your work and your articles
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.340]   over the years.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.620]   And keep up the great work.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.980]   Thank you.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.300]   And now, I'd like to introduce Debbie Feuer.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:51.480]   Debbie is the top ETF analyst in the entire world.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.980]   And I've known Debbie for many years,
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.420]   and I've worked with her on many panels.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.540]   And I'm happy to have her with us today.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.140]   Welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, Debbie.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:03.640]   Thank you.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.300]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.100]   Well, I'm excited to have you, because you
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.180]   are one of my heroes in the indexing world.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.060]   You are, I believe, the most knowledgeable person anywhere
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.580]   on exchange-traded funds and other exchange-traded products.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.940]   You have the premier research company
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.480]   on exchange-traded funds.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.300]   How did you get into this back in the 1990s?
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.820]   Well, thank you for those really kind words and introduction.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.260]   So I got into it because I wanted
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.780]   to work for Morgan Stanley.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.900]   I was offered a job initially to work in marketing
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.660]   for the equity division in London.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.420]   And the woman who was bringing me in
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.700]   ended up being moved into another role.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.820]   And a month later, she contacted me and said,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.780]   they're interviewing to find someone
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:57.100]   to come in and be the director of marketing for Opals and ETFs.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.020]   And so in finance, everything has acronyms.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.580]   And so Opals at the time stood for Optimized Portfolios
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.460]   as Listed Securities.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.980]   And they were very much like ETFs
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.460]   in that if someone wanted to invest in the S&P 500,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.780]   Morgan Stanley's trading desk-- so I sat in sales and trading
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.060]   in the equity division--
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.780]   would go out and buy the underlying portfolio.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.440]   And these products were listed on the Luxembourg Stock
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.580]   Exchange, which isn't really a trading exchange,
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.220]   but more a listing venue.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.800]   And we would mark up and down, so kind
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.420]   of like the Creation Redemption ETFs, the Opal.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.380]   So for those of you who know ETFs,
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.420]   that sounds pretty similar to ETFs.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.100]   And we wanted at Morgan Stanley to create ETFs.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.580]   And we partnered with Barclays Global Investors and MSCI
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:55.180]   to create a family of 17 MSCI country ETFs, which
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.340]   were called WEBS, World Equity Benchmark Shares.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.460]   Deb, I remember the WEBS.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.100]   And weren't they the first opened-end mutual fund ETFs,
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.740]   as opposed to Unit Investment Trust,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.740]   which SPDRs and MIDIs were?
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.220]   Exactly, so very good memory.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.140]   And so my job was to market SPY, the Unit Investment
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.140]   Trust in the US, for US exposure and WEBS
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.460]   for the rest of the world.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.980]   Many people didn't get what I was
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.980]   saying when I was doing SPDR and WEBS.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.340]   And in 1999, BGI, Barclays Global Investors,
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.860]   rebranded those WEBS to be iShares,
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.460]   because they were going to have a whole family of ETFs.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.180]   And so most of your listeners probably
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.540]   know iShares are now part of BlackRock.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.500]   So BlackRock bought BGI.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.620]   The rest is kind of history.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.540]   And the term exchange-traded fund
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.900]   didn't exist for quite a while.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.020]   SPYDRs and MIDIs and WEBS and OPALs,
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.860]   and they had all these different acronyms.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.420]   How is it that the term exchange-traded fund came
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.980]   around?
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.300]   Well, it's funny you should say that, because I've
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.460]   been based in the UK now for 25 years.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.300]   And there actually were exchange-traded funds
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.420]   in Amsterdam for probably now over 100 years.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.860]   And so they were just traditional open-ended funds
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.380]   that were listed on exchange.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.020]   Sometimes they had market makers,
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.620]   and sometimes they didn't.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.780]   So when ETFs actually went to Amsterdam,
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.220]   they called them tracker funds and not ETFs.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.860]   They became known as exchange-traded funds
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:40.020]   because at the heart of it, ETFs are highly regulated funds,
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.620]   such as 1940 acts in the US or USITS funds,
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.180]   the regulations here in Europe, with some added benefits
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.580]   of being listed and traded on exchange.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.180]   So it was really to identify the fact that they were funds
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.020]   and they were exchange-traded.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.420]   And I get disappointed when people say ETFs are asset
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.580]   classes or an asset class, because inside of an ETF,
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.580]   as you know, you can have exposure
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.980]   to different types of equity benchmarks or fixed income
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.580]   or commodities.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.460]   And you can also have things that are active.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.140]   So it's really a wrapper that allows
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.580]   you to package, like a mutual fund,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.780]   any different types of exposure.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.180]   And there are differences between a unit investment
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.580]   trust and an open-ended management company.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.020]   And the reason the webs went down
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.100]   the route of being an open-ended management company
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.420]   is if you do a unit investment trust,
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.060]   that product must fully replicate.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.860]   It can't optimize or buy a subset.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.780]   It can't reinvest.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.300]   And it can't do any securities lending.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.460]   So when you came to these bigger, more diversified
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.420]   markets, where it was often difficult to buy
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.620]   all the securities, especially if the fund started
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.300]   with a smaller size, or the ETF did,
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.820]   you needed to be able to buy a subset.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.060]   So you would use a quantitative model
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.860]   to build a basket that would track the index,
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.620]   but not fully replicate.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.820]   And there are some benefits, because it allows you not
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.180]   to buy names that are difficult to buy.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.660]   It allows you to save on some transaction costs.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.380]   But it does mean that it's not going
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.300]   to track as well as a product that is fully replicating.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.340]   I remember also there was a couple of countries
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.180]   where one stock would be 50% of the entire exchange.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:30.220]   And it violated IRS rules and mutual fund 40-act rules
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.940]   to create a fund that had non-diversification like that.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.900]   So the web structure, the open-end fund structure,
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.020]   rather than the unit investment trust structure, was the answer.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.700]   Exactly, and another thing they could do
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.420]   is, if there weren't enough names in the index stocks,
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.220]   they are allowed to buy securities
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.100]   that are similar to the securities in the index,
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.660]   such as some of the smaller European countries,
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.620]   so that they could then be diversified.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.220]   So there are some additional benefits
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.020]   that were accrued to the open-end management structure,
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.460]   including being able to do securities lending
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.980]   and sharing that with the fund or the investors,
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.780]   being able to use derivatives and doing some other things
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:19.020]   that can benefit and reinvest, at least in the short run.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.700]   So it does add benefits to the ETF offering.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.420]   I had a feeling that when you and I started
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.700]   going down memory lane, that we'd get very esoteric
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.300]   very quickly.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:34.780]   So I had to pull it back to how you ended up
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.180]   starting your company after BlackRock, Barclays,
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.740]   and so forth.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.860]   Could you continue on?
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.780]   Sorry to have interrupted you.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.580]   No, that's OK.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.700]   So maybe I should say, I spent 11 years
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.420]   working at Morgan Stanley on the sales and trading floor.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.340]   I had various roles.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.700]   So I was doing product development.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.580]   I was doing sales and marketing.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.540]   I was writing research, sitting on the sales and trading floor,
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.700]   until Spitzer came along in the US.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.540]   And then, rather than technically moving
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.980]   into research and changing where I sat and what I did,
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.540]   I started writing market commentary.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.500]   Became a managing director, and then the fixed income division
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.980]   took over equities in 2007.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.820]   I left with my team in 2008 and looked around
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.340]   for different places to go, liking ETFs a lot,
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.380]   because I believe they offer a lot of benefits,
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.300]   being low cost, transparent, easy diversification,
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.100]   and uniquely democratic in that both institutions,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.860]   financial advisors, and then retail
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.780]   have access to the same toolbox of products
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.860]   at the same small size with low cost, which is quite unique.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.460]   And this is when you decided to join Barclays.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.100]   So decided that I would join Barclays Global Investors
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:54.900]   as a managing director to create ETF industry research for them
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.020]   and work on implementation strategy.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.140]   So my first day at BGI was the day
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.460]   Lehman filed for bankruptcy.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.780]   So that was an interesting first day.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.420]   I spent about three years at BGI, which,
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.100]   as many of your listeners will recall,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.060]   BGI was bought by BlackRock because BlackRock
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:19.220]   was an active asset manager, saw the benefits of ETFs and index.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.460]   And after that happened, I decided
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.220]   I wanted to go back to the sell side,
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   meaning to a brokerage firm, so that I could interact
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.700]   with more clients and get more involved in the things
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.420]   that I enjoyed doing in the past.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.900]   So decided to accept a job to be the global head of Delta One
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:42.860]   strategy at an investment bank the beginning of July 2011
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.940]   and resigned from BlackRock.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.100]   That investment bank, as many often do,
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.060]   reorganized almost just two weeks later.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.580]   Decided that given the changes at this brokerage firm,
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.100]   it was probably unlikely that they
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.540]   would follow the strategy I thought
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.620]   they were going to follow.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.220]   I had offered to go set up my company at that point.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.060]   We spent the summer at Starbucks putting together
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.140]   the plan for ETFGI, which is an independent research
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.780]   and consulting firm based in London.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.380]   We offer paid for subscription research.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.260]   We do some consulting work.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.740]   And we also do some events.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.700]   And it's been an interesting journey.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.860]   Started it in the beginning of 2012
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:30.300]   and have been able, doing that, to go and see
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   the world through ETF.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.780]   So I've actually been lucky to have
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:38.220]   gone to 63 different countries now talking about ETFs
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.340]   at events that are organized by regulators or others.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.180]   And sometimes I get to do fun things,
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.540]   like when I was in Kenya to speak at an event,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.340]   I actually went to an elephant orphanage
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.420]   and adopted a baby girl elephant, which
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.020]   means you're paying for their milk for a year.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.380]   And I went to the giraffe center where
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:01.460]   they're trying to stimulate more giraffes of the Rothschild
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.060]   breed because they're getting close to extinction.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.060]   So sometimes you get to do fun things
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.700]   that you wouldn't be able to do in your normal day job.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.860]   Now you went to 63 countries.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.980]   I have a research report.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.300]   It might be a couple of months old from you
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.980]   that says that there are 58 countries that currently have
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.380]   exchange traded products.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.740]   Is it now expanded?
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.220]   I haven't been to all the countries that have ETFs.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.300]   And I've been to some countries that do not have ETFs.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.860]   So as an example, I've been to Brunei.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.580]   And I was in Lebanon recently.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.540]   There are countries that don't have ETFs.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.060]   It may be surprising to your listeners.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.900]   There are even ETFs in Iran.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.420]   They have a type of ETF there that's
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.020]   kind of interesting, which is physical real estate.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.820]   And you might say, well, what does that mean?
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.620]   So to comply with Sharia law, the asset manager
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.140]   would buy property.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.940]   They would build a building with apartments, sell the apartments,
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.060]   and then pay back profits to the investors.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.860]   So you find around the world there
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.540]   are some tweaks on what can be done and how it's done.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.020]   But it definitely has been an interesting experience
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.500]   to be involved in the industry.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.940]   But I expect it to continue on for some time.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.660]   I still very much enjoy what I'm doing.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.700]   So let's talk a little bit more about the trends globally.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.220]   What people are buying?
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:29.740]   What's driving the assets to exchange-traded funds?
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.700]   Not so much in the US, but globally.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.300]   What are the big factors that are
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.100]   causing the growth of ETFs and driving assets to it?
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.100]   That's a great question.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.020]   So I think it really comes down to, for many investors--
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.420]   and everyone would love to be able to be a great stock picker
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.060]   and pick something that's going to do better than the market.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.780]   And so most investors have this thought
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.260]   that they would like to find alpha,
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.220]   either through buying stocks, buying mutual funds,
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.340]   buying hedge funds, buying something.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.740]   That gets increasingly difficult.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.220]   And that challenge of finding active funds that consistently
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.940]   deliver alpha, hedge funds that consistently deliver alpha,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.140]   or even as an individual, picking stocks or relying
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.860]   on your financial advisor to do that is challenging.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.300]   So what you find is most investors
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.700]   are looking at this barbell approach to investing.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.620]   So if they believe or want to believe
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.740]   that they can generate some alpha,
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.420]   have funds that are going to do it, they put money there.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.020]   But as people invest in more asset classes, segments
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.420]   of the markets, types of exposures,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.100]   they're increasingly turning to index products like ETFs,
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.900]   and sometimes active, but mostly index.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.180]   Because the goal for many is to generate alpha
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.660]   through asset allocation.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.180]   And so you see this barbell approach
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.500]   to investing, where it's active stuff on one hand,
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.900]   index stuff on the other, trying to create good returns.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.500]   So I think that's a big driver.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.980]   I think that the fact that it is very
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.620]   difficult to find active funds that consistently deliver alpha
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.940]   is a big challenge and a driver.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.860]   So if you look at the performance of, say,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.660]   the S&P 500 index, and you compare it
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.100]   to large cap active funds, and S&P, every six months,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.780]   does what they call their SPIVA study.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.780]   The last one I looked at said that on a three-year basis,
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.540]   79% didn't.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.620]   And on a five-year basis, 76% did not.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:36.140]   So you can spend a lot of time trying to find the funds that
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.420]   are doing it now.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.580]   The likelihood of them doing it going forward is challenging.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.700]   So many people decide going to index makes sense.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:50.900]   We've also seen that ETFs have become a solution or a tool
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.020]   for many investors.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.900]   For those that are more sophisticated that
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.620]   might use futures, if you're not looking for leverage
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.700]   and just want to put money into the market,
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.300]   or what I would call equitized cash,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.500]   ETFs can be more cost efficient in many cases
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.260]   due to regulatory changes causing
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.420]   the cost of rolling futures to be more expensive.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.660]   Many are using ETFs today for plain vanilla exposure
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.820]   rather than using futures.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.460]   I think robos have been a big driver getting people
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.740]   to use ETFs, because every day in the US,
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.220]   10,000 turns 55 years old.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.780]   And when those people get to that age,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.980]   they start looking at where and how should I invest.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.860]   And having that conversation about investing
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.900]   is often very challenging, where you don't often
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.220]   want to tell your friends, your family,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.660]   you don't know what you're doing.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.860]   You often don't want to divulge how much money you've
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.820]   made or are making and how much you saved or didn't save.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.460]   So robos are a very easy tool to go play with asset allocation
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.220]   to learn about the impact of cost.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.940]   So buying less costly products help you over the long run.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.060]   And many people at the end of that
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.500]   end up using ETFs, because most robos use ETFs.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.500]   And it's also interesting, because the average age
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.140]   of most robo users is 47 and not millennials.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.100]   But I think the real reason many people just use ETFs
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:16.820]   is today, when we have so much political and economic news
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.060]   happening in the market, people want
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.620]   to be able to adjust their allocations in a very
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.620]   easy and timely fashion.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.660]   And within the US alone, over 2,000 products.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:34.380]   And globally, we have 7,700 ETFs with $5.7 trillion.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.100]   People use ETFs in many different ways.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.300]   So to equitize cash, short term, tactically to adjust.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.140]   And about half of investors use ETFs for more than two years.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.420]   Individuals, though, aren't the only ones
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.740]   who are propelling this market.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:55.140]   Some large institutions are doing it also, correct?
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.260]   If you were to look at ETFs in Japan, about 70%
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.900]   of all the assets-- and there's about $323 billion there--
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.580]   70% is owned by the Bank of Japan.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.660]   They have been using ETFs for quantitative easing.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.580]   In Hong Kong, the biggest ETF is the Hong Kong Tracker Fund.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.860]   And that is an ETF that was created
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.460]   after the government in Hong Kong
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.340]   bought shares during the Asian crisis just over 20 years ago.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.860]   And after the Asian crisis had gone away,
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.400]   the government looked at, so what do we
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.980]   do with all these securities?
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.380]   And they decided, rather than selling them back
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.300]   in the market, which would have looked negative,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.460]   they created the Hong Kong Tracker Fund,
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.580]   which will celebrate its 20th anniversary in November
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.460]   this year.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.980]   The government of India has created ETFs
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.780]   as a way to dispose of securities
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.540]   that they own that they also don't want
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.620]   to sell them to the market.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.300]   So they've created new indices.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.700]   On the equity side, twice, they're
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.660]   working on creating a new fixed income product, as well
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.940]   as a new equity one.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.860]   And we've seen others decide that they
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.540]   want new types of products, such as diversity
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.980]   has been a thing, where many of your viewers
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.940]   might have seen the Fearless Girl
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.140]   statue that was placed in front of the Raging
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.140]   Bull down by Wall Street.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.300]   That product that kind of goes along with the Fearless Girl
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   was a diversity ETF that was seeded with $100 million
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.020]   from one of the California pension funds.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.580]   And we've seen the same a year ago,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:36.180]   where RBC launched in Canada a diversity ETF also
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.220]   around March 8, International Women's Day, which
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.700]   was seeded with about $100 million
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.180]   from one of the Canadian pension funds.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:46.380]   So we've seen a lot of innovative things going on.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.300]   And when you look at the flows, you
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.060]   can measure flows typically within a few days
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.980]   after the end of the month, where with mutual funds,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.300]   as you know, it takes often eight to 10 weeks
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.020]   to get the data.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.260]   Could you elaborate on ETF flows?
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.820]   So I think what I would say is the overall flows--
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.860]   and when I talk about flows, what I'm measuring
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.500]   is creations versus redemption.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.580]   So most ETF trading is secondary trading.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.660]   So you might own shares in an ETF,
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.300]   and you decide to sell them.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.780]   Someone else wants to buy them.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.860]   So those shares of the existing ETF move around.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.500]   Primary trading is when there's a really big order,
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.540]   and big is more than 20% of the average daily volume
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.460]   in an ETF or a security.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.580]   When that happens, there are banks or brokerage firms
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.660]   who are called APs, or authorized participants.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:46.100]   And they're allowed to trade these securities in an ETF.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.340]   And so every ETF has what's called a creation basket.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.860]   And this is typically either a fully replicating
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.140]   set of securities that match the index or something
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.020]   that is optimized or a subset.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:03.300]   They will trade that typically in increments of $50,000.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.860]   That gets sent to the custodian, and the ETF gets bigger.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:10.060]   So we're measuring creations versus the other side
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.180]   redemption.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.020]   And in the month of April, as an example,
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.100]   globally, we had $46 billion of net new money going into ETFs
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.020]   globally.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:22.980]   And about $35 billion went into equity-focused products.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.860]   About $12 billion went into fixed income.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.460]   $3 billion went into active.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.300]   We had just under $1 billion going
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.540]   into leverage and inverse, some currency hedge.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.500]   There's also commodity products, although they had net outflows.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.260]   And on a year-to-date basis so far this year,
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:45.340]   we've seen $145 billion going into ETFs.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.220]   But one of the unique things I would say
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:55.540]   is we have had 63 months of consecutive positive net inflows
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.460]   into ETFs globally.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.580]   I do not know of any other product that could say that.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.580]   That's more than five years.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.740]   And what would the flows be for traditional mutual funds
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.020]   during the same time period?
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.860]   Most active funds have had net outflows during that time,
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.820]   and hedge funds have had a lot of net outflows
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.700]   during that time.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.100]   Let me circle back to something you said about what's
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.020]   driving all this.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.660]   And you said one of the things is just
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.700]   exposures to asset classes.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   They're looking to get the return of the market
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.260]   that they live in.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.940]   And on the other side, if they're
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.740]   confident that they might outperform,
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.420]   they're making an active bet.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.980]   That's what you mean by barbell, correct?
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.300]   Exactly.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.220]   And we talked about the fact that 79% of US large cap active
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.660]   managers didn't beat the S&P 500.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.340]   But I went through with Robin a laundry list
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.100]   of all the other countries.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.940]   It's not just the US.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.300]   When we look at Europe, 86% over the last three years
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.020]   underperformed the European index.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.620]   If we look at India, 91% of active managers
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.140]   underperformed the index that S&P uses for India.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.260]   Australia, 86%.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.620]   I mean, these numbers are almost consistent,
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.100]   and they're mutually exclusive.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.340]   Canada, 94% of active managers underperformed.
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.100]   These are all mutually exclusive because
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.180]   of all different countries.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.700]   But the numbers are almost the same.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:25.620]   I mean, it averages out over the last three years to about 80%
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.020]   to 85% if you were going to look at all of these.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:29.740]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.180]   I mean, I have a map of the world
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.300]   that S&P has made for me a long time ago,
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.780]   partially because I asked them to do a SPIVA study when
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.540]   I was speaking in South Africa.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.900]   So if you look at Mexico, Chile, Brazil, South Africa,
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.180]   you can add that to the list.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.580]   It's typically 7 out of 10 active funds
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.820]   do not beat their benchmark in any given one-year period.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.660]   And then it tends to get worse on a three-year basis.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.940]   So that's a real challenge.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.420]   And they charge higher fees, right?
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.820]   So all in all, if you were to look at your paying higher
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:07.220]   fees, if many of these products didn't charge such high fees,
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.220]   they might actually be beating their benchmark.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.300]   But it is the higher fees that they tend to charge.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.340]   And fees vary a lot around the world.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.780]   But typically, it would be over 1 and 1/2%
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:23.140]   is kind of the typical average annual cost for an active fund.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.980]   And often, you pay penalties if you move your money out
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.340]   in a period that's less than six months of holding that product.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.300]   So you have to be careful of the different costs
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.180]   you might incur when you buy different types of products.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.220]   So as countries take this data, and with your help
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.860]   as a consultant to these countries,
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:47.300]   and they decide they're going to launch ETFs in that country,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.140]   or the regulators in that country
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.940]   are going to launch ETFs, the first ones that come out
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.540]   are generally broad market tracking?
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.620]   I would define them a little bit differently.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.500]   They tend to be the blue-chip indices on the equity side
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.380]   that people know.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.780]   So people open the newspapers in the US.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.900]   Most people would know the S&P 500 or something.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.060]   That's a well-known index.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.580]   So you tend to find when products
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.500]   come to market in different countries around the world,
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.860]   it tends to be one of the indices that is quoted
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.460]   in the newspapers all the time.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.180]   How long after a country who has never
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.420]   had this type of a product before when they launch an ETF
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.820]   that might be tracking those blue-chip indexes,
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.420]   how long does it take before it really starts to catch on
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.540]   and people begin to understand what it is?
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.540]   That's a great question.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.900]   So part of the challenge for ETFs
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.460]   is that, although we think of them as a retail product,
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.380]   in many jurisdictions around the world,
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:49.580]   financial advisors are paid by the firms that
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.740]   make mutual funds or structured products
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.220]   or other types of financial products.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.740]   They're paid to sell these products.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:01.420]   And so when that happens, the financial advisors
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.740]   do not talk about ETFs because ETFs do not
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.540]   pay advisors to sell them.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.700]   They work best where financial advisors are
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.180]   paid explicitly for advice.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.060]   And then the advisors are helping
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:21.380]   to build portfolios to suit their clients.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.820]   When John Bogle and Vanguard launched the first S&P 500
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.460]   index fund here in the US, they went through the brokerage
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.900]   industry to do it.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.140]   They thought they were going to raise, I believe,
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.340]   $150 million in assets.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.540]   And they only raised $11 for the exact reason
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.860]   you're talking about.
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:44.020]   Advisors are still paid to sell products in markets like India.
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.820]   Most of Asia-Pacific is that way.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.140]   In Europe, it only changed in January this year
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.380]   that across Europe, if a financial advisor is
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.140]   independent, they are no longer allowed
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.900]   to be paid to sell products.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.620]   So that's been a big change, but it takes time even for that
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.380]   to cause people to change their behaviors.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.620]   But I think it's a good thing.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.380]   In fact, in the US, we're battling
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.700]   over this fiduciary rule.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.740]   And it doesn't seem like we're going to get one.
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.820]   We're going to get a best interest rule.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:17.220]   And I was just thinking that if we eliminated commission sales
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.300]   here, financial advisors couldn't do commission sales,
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.780]   that would go a long way toward getting advisors
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.860]   to do the right thing.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.260]   So part of the challenge, too--
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.940]   so the UK change happened in 2013.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:35.100]   So it was called the Retail Distribution Review, or RDR.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.260]   And in Holland, it happened a year later.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:41.940]   In the UK, we still find that many financial advisors have
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.620]   historically gone to what we call mutual fund platforms
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.580]   or platforms to buy mutual funds.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.300]   And they still go to these platforms
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.380]   because they're kind of tied into them.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.540]   The challenge is to buy and sell mutual funds,
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.820]   you don't need access to the stock exchange.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.860]   So many of these large platforms don't
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.820]   offer the ability for financial advisors to use ETFs.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.300]   And when asked about it, they say, well, there's no demand.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.420]   But the real challenge has been it
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.420]   would cost them some money to develop the technology.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.380]   It's not that expensive, and it's not that difficult.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.940]   But to make the change to be able to have connectivity
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.900]   so that advisors could access ETFs is something they just
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.540]   say there's no demand, so they're not doing it.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.860]   So it's still not a level playing field,
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.300]   even when regulations have changed in many cases.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.620]   Let's switch gears a little bit.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:42.180]   I want to talk about ESG, Environmental, Corporate,
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.300]   and Social Governance.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.500]   Everywhere I turn right now, it's
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.180]   all about ESG, different ESG funds coming up
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.300]   all over the place.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:57.620]   Do you see a big future for ESG, a permanent, stable future
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:02.780]   for ESG, or is this just another fad that's going on?
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.100]   I believe it's here for the long run now,
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.220]   partially because what it means when you talk about ESG
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.100]   has changed a lot.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.060]   So it used to be, many years ago,
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.660]   that ESG was basically removing the sin stock,
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:22.340]   so taking out tobacco, pornography, et cetera.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:27.060]   What you found is the way products are made today
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.860]   in terms of indices has changed a lot.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.380]   And in many cases, what they're doing
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:36.460]   is they are evaluating companies on how well they perform
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:41.460]   on different governance issues, on environmental issues.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.580]   And companies that tend to perform better actually
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:49.780]   are better-run companies and do perform better.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.900]   And so it used to be that the sin stocks actually
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.260]   did better than the non-sin because tobacco
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.860]   had such high margins.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.980]   And so I think that fundamental shift, believing climate
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.660]   change, believing in the need to look
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.300]   at solar and alternative energies
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.420]   and all these other things, is really
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.140]   being embraced very significantly here in Europe.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:15.540]   So when we look at ESG as a type of exposure within even ETFs,
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.980]   right now, there's about $30 billion,
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.620]   which is not a lot out of that $5.7 trillion globally.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:25.380]   But what we see is, if we were to look at the overall industry,
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:29.180]   the US product set in the US accounts
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.820]   for 70% of all the assets.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.340]   And Europe is only like 17%.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:39.900]   When we look at ESG, Europe accounts for nearly 60%
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.300]   of all the assets.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:45.140]   So we have a lot more people in Europe
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:49.820]   individually and asset owners, so pension funds and others,
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:53.700]   embracing investing using this lens.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.780]   And the reason is, in many cases,
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.140]   the governments in France and Belgium
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:06.060]   are saying that asset owners must look at things this way.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.260]   So I believe that over time, ESG will be incorporated.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.380]   Mainstream into everything.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.580]   I mean, there's actually been a very large launch
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.940]   of a new ETF in the US in the past two months.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.180]   It was actually a Finnish insurance company
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.540]   that seeded a new ETF listed in the US,
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:30.820]   based on the MSCI ESG criteria, with $845 million.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.540]   So although it's in the US, it's still coming from Europe.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.180]   Although in our numbers, it would show up
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.700]   as being kind of in the US and domiciled there.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.420]   So I think it's moved on a lot.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.180]   I think it's continuing to move on.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:47.860]   And, you know, earlier when I spoke about the diversity ETFs,
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.180]   that, for me, would also fall into an ESG thing.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.860]   Although there is some crossover between ESG and themes, right?
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.100]   Because some would say diversity is a theme.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.500]   So right now, we have governments in Europe
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:06.540]   and in the UK trying to define what is ESG
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.020]   and what are the standards, what is impact investing.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.580]   So it's something the governments are actually
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.660]   getting much more involved with here
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.620]   than I've seen in other jurisdictions around the world.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.460]   - Well, thank you, Debbie.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.580]   I want to end with one more item,
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.700]   and that is you are the founder
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:25.020]   and a board member of Woman in ETFs.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.860]   And it's been a huge organization here in the US.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.500]   And could you talk about that?
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.100]   - Yeah, so thank you for mentioning that.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.260]   That was something that five of us started in the US,
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.100]   we just turned five years old.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:43.260]   And so Joanne Hill, Sue Thompson, Linda Zhang,
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:48.100]   Michelle Mikos, and myself got together and thought,
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.860]   there's a real need and opportunity
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.060]   to help women come into the ETF industry,
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.540]   to stay in the ETF industry, and to have a good career.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.580]   And often it's difficult to ask your boss,
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:03.180]   especially if you're sitting on a trading floor
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.940]   and it's all men and they're very busy.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.900]   So we wanted it to be a way to help educate people
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.660]   to help them grow their career.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.660]   So the three pillars are really
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.060]   connect, support, and inspire.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.220]   After I helped set up the organization in the US,
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.900]   which is a nonprofit,
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.660]   I decided we should have something similar in Europe.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.340]   So we actually have a legal entity here,
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.900]   and we have chapters across Europe.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.540]   And also we have a chapter in South Africa,
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.700]   and we have a chapter or actually two in Canada,
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.420]   and we also have the Mountain Asia.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.180]   So it's been exciting.
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.380]   I mean, we do university outreach.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:45.060]   So we go and teach lectures and do events at universities.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:49.460]   We do one-on-one mentoring schemes that last 10 months.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.740]   We also have like mentorship dinners
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:55.140]   where people can just meet more senior people.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.460]   We have a speakers bureau to encourage the press
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.340]   to speak to women that are qualified
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.140]   and allowed to speak to the press or to speak at events.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:07.100]   We do various types of educational events.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.260]   So on Friday here in London,
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:11.780]   we have an event on investing in China.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.060]   We've done diversity events.
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.940]   And one of the things that I've been involved with a lot is
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.460]   for International Women's Day, which is March 8th,
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.420]   women in ETFs in the first year
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.780]   rang the bells at nine exchanges.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.660]   I noticed that the UN was ringing some different bells
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.540]   and I asked them if they would work with us
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:30.940]   to do it next year.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.940]   And so we now partner with UN Women, UN Global Compact,
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.700]   the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative,
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.940]   the International Finance Corporation
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.700]   and World Federation of Exchanges.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.700]   So we went from nine to 33 exchanges to 45 to 65
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:52.780]   to this year, we rang bells at 85 exchanges around the world,
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.900]   which is pretty exciting.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.620]   - Yeah, that's quite impressive.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.660]   Well, great, congratulations on that growth.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.740]   That's wonderful.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:00.580]   Go ahead. - Sorry.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.420]   And maybe I can just say,
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.460]   so we have over 5,000 members right now
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.860]   and 17% of our members are men.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.380]   So having men as part of the solution is really important.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.900]   And I should say, we probably should change our name
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.100]   from women in ETFs.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.620]   We really do want to embracing all types of people
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.580]   to get into the industry and have a great experience.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.260]   - Well, thank you so much for your time, Debbie.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.940]   I mean, really appreciate.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:25.740]   I know we could go on for a long time talking about this
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:28.180]   and we wouldn't even be scratching the surface
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.780]   on the knowledge that you have on indexing
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.660]   in the ETF industry and the growth globally and so forth.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.700]   Thank you so much for spending the time with us today.
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:37.660]   - No, thank you.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.340]   It's been a pleasure.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.380]   - This concludes the 10th episode
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.420]   of Bogleheads on investing.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.700]   I'm your host, Rick Ferry.
