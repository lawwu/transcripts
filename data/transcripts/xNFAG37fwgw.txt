[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Focusing on Christ is the most important, the most transforming thing that we can do.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.920]   So let's look at Him in a conversation in the 19th chapter of Luke, Luke chapter 19,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:28.120]   a very familiar story, but one that illustrates the greatest truth of His life.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:36.720]   Luke 19: "He entered Jericho and was passing through, and there was a man called by the
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.240]   name of Zacchaeus.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.420]   He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich."
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.840]   Zacchaeus was trying to see who Jesus was and was unable because of the crowd, for He
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.780]   was small in stature.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.120]   So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.100]   For He was about to pass through that way.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.420]   When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.700]   down, for today I must stay at your house."
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.800]   And He hurried and came down and received him gladly.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.120]   When they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the God of the
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.700]   Lord, the guest of a man who is a sinner!"
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.620]   Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:51.020]   the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much."
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.120]   And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because He too is
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.860]   a son of Abraham.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.520]   For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.440]   That last verse is a definitive declaration of the purpose for the incarnation.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.460]   Jesus came into the world to seek and to save lost sinners.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.120]   This is the divine enterprise.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:39.760]   In God's redemptive plan, from the fall of man, God has always sought out sinners.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.960]   All the way back in the book of Genesis, after Adam and Eve had sinned, God comes into the
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.560]   garden and says, "Where are you?
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.900]   Where are you?"
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.120]   And ever since then, God has been there.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.700]   "seeking sinners," "seeking the lost."
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.300]   In one of the most beautiful Old Testament texts, Ezekiel quotes God saying this: "I
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:20.040]   will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken, and strengthen the sick"
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.880]   .
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.100]   God is a seeking God.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.900]   He's not in some form of isolation waiting for us to figure out a way to get to Him.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.200]   He rather seeks us.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.820]   And by the way, Romans 3:11 says, "No man seeks after God."
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.660]   We are neither able nor willing to seek after God.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.280]   He is beyond human discovery.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.100]   God has to seek us.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.860]   And that is the story of the Bible.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.080]   That is the story of the Incarnation.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.840]   The Incarnation of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.580]   He seeks sinners.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.000]   He seeks sinners.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.020]   And that's what this story is about.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.340]   And it's really counterintuitive.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.420]   If you were a Jew in Jericho and you were there this day, you would have been in utter
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.060]   shock and dismay that he would have sought the sinner that he sought.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.780]   But this is the work of the Son of Man.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.660]   Son of Man is the messianic title that we find in Daniel, chapter 7, emphasizing
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.740]   His humanity as well as His glory.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.060]   And verse 10 says, "He has come" - meaning at His birth, in the Incarnation.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.060]   Why?
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.060]   "To seek and save that which was lost."
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.060]   Why?
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.060]   To seek and save that which was lost.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.060]   Why?
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.060]   To seek and save that which was lost.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060]   Why?
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.060]   Because He is the one who has come.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.060]   He is the one who has come.

[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060]   He is the one who has come.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:26:00.740]   Verse 5, shocking: "When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, 'Zacchaeus!'
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.080]   That must have jolted Him.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.860]   How did He know His name?
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.300]   How in the world did He know His name?
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   'Zacchaeus!'
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.960]   This is who He is seeking.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.300]   The Lord is seeking this man.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:25.060]   This wretched, this worst of the worst, this outcast.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:33.580]   And He says, "Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.880]   He probably never expected to catch the eye of Jesus.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.920]   He certainly never would have expected that Jesus knew His name.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:47.540]   He would not have expected that Jesus would ask Him to come down and open His home to
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.120]   Him, so He could stay in the house.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.780]   He would never have thought that.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.780]   Why?
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.220]   Because nobody ate with Him.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.960]   Nobody went into His house.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:09.420]   That simple statement, "I must stay at your house," means to spend the night.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:14.780]   This is not a request; this is a command.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.780]   And to everybody in town, this is a command.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:22.460]   This is beyond comprehension, because this is Jesus.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:29.380]   He's supposed to be the Messiah, and He's going to go into the house of the most corrupt
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:34.780]   and wretched sinner in town.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:46.620]   Well, Zacchaeus responded, verse 6: "He hurried and came down and received Him gladly."
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.220]   Joy, joy, not fear.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.380]   Joy.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:03.020]   This was joy to Zacchaeus, because somebody was willing to come to his house, and that
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.040]   somebody was the one that they said was Messiah.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.680]   This was joy to the Lord, because the Lord finds His joy in the salvation of sinners.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   What about the population?
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.300]   What did they think?
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.500]   Verse 7.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:26.460]   "When they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, 'He has gone to be the guest of a
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.680]   man who is a sinner.'"
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:38.220]   They wouldn't assume that the Messiah would come and go to a man who's a sinner.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:44.500]   That was part of the whole drama with Jesus, because when Jesus came in the incarnation
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.500]   into Israel.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   He was a sinner.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:52.060]   He spent time with sinners and tax collectors and prostitutes, and He ate with them.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.460]   That's how chapter 15 begins, verses 1 and 2.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:02.500]   Just to remind you of it.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:11.440]   "Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.500]   But the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, 'This man receives sinners,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.220]   and eats with them.'"
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:28.580]   What happened to Zacchaeus wasn't particularly rare in the ministry of our Lord.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:34.180]   But the crowd was profoundly affected.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.220]   How can this be the Messiah?
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.440]   They knew that He had given sight to a blind man.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.460]   He had demonstrated miracle power.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.660]   But He's not.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:51.940]   But He's the guest of a man who is a sinner.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:30:02.500]   This in one statement shows you why the Jews rejected Jesus, because He came for the sinners.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:09.100]   And if you thought you were righteous, you were offended by Him.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.140]   Seriously offended.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.380]   So offended, you crucified Him at the hands of the Romans.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.380]   You were a sinner.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.300]   You were a sinner.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.500]   You were a sinner.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.500]   You were a sinner.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:26.620]   The massive offense of Jesus was that He came to save sinners.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:34.060]   This was unacceptable to the self-righteous people of Israel.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:41.380]   They had tried so hard to be righteous with the minutia of the law.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:53.380]   Instead, "I have not come to call the righteous sarcastically, but sinners to repentance."
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:00.620]   The attitude that you have in verse 7, "He's gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner,"
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:09.500]   was the fixed national attitude toward Jesus that resulted in His rejection and His execution.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   And so, what does that mean?
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.180]   It means that He's gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.340]   That's why the nations rejected Him.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.540]   That's why the nation rejected Him.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:28.260]   It's righteous people who can't accept the gospel.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:34.480]   In order to come into the kingdom, you have to be unrighteous and know it.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.380]   Remember the Beatitudes?
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.620]   Meek, hungering after righteousness.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.620]   Righteous people.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:46.940]   But that also was not the Jews.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   They were smugly satisfied with their righteousness.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.240]   Jesus couldn't be the Messiah, no matter how many people He healed, no matter how many
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.420]   dead people He raised from the dead, no matter how many profound words He said.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:06.620]   He couldn't possibly be the Messiah, because all He did was spend time with sinners.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   That's what He did.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.620]   He was a sinner.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.620]   He was a sinner.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:22.500]   Well, this one sinner, Zacchaeus, hurried and came down and received Him gladly.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.680]   And then verse 7 says, "They're in shock, and they complain.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.580]   And after - " verse 7 " - the curtain falls; scene one is over".
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.900]   The curtain falls, and He is gone.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.140]   Notice how it's worded: "He has gone to be the guest of a man who's a sinner."
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.140]   So He's gone.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.640]   He went with Jesus to His house.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:53.560]   We don't know how much time elapsed, likely that night, the next day.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:33:01.020]   And in verse 8, the curtain rises again on the next scene, and what's going on?
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:08.660]   "Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, 'Behold, Lord!
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.660]   Behold, Lord!'"
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.120]   Let me just stop there.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.340]   If you get that right, you understand what salvation is.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.660]   Whoever confesses Jesus says what?
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.660]   "Lord."
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.160]   Behold, Lord!
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:33.420]   Look, half of My possessions I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.180]   anything, I'll give back four times as much.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:45.760]   This is a dramatic transformation.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:58.180]   From being a thief and a professional extortioner, he becomes a philanthropist in one day.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:04.680]   Jesus said in verse 9, "Today salvation has come to this house."
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.680]   Today?
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.700]   Can you be saved in a day?
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.460]   Is there a process involved?
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.700]   No.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.280]   Today, salvation has come to this house.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.700]   How did Jesus know that?
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:27.520]   Well, He knew it because Zacchaeus brought forth the fruit of repentance and the fruit
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.020]   of salvation.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.220]   Contrary to the rich young ruler who didn't want to give up anything.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:43.840]   This man is ready to divest himself of half of his entire fortune, and a whole lot more
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.480]   of whatever was left if you're going to pay back people four times.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:57.660]   So whatever the conversation was at his house ended in his accepting Christ as his Lord.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.620]   This is the confession of lordship.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:06.220]   And with that confession comes salvation.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:17.680]   And he is a transformed man, lavishly giving away everything he has.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:25.980]   You can always identify the true Christians by their fruit, by their life.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.280]   This is the mark of a changed man.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.780]   He holds everything lightly.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.740]   He wants to make things right.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:42.840]   He wants to, as much as he can, undo his corruption and his sin.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:51.620]   If I have defrauded anyone, and he had, probably many, I'll give them back fourfold.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:59.740]   At that pace, giving the poor half of what you have and giving back fourfold what you
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.740]   extorted, you could virtually wind up penniless.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.260]   It didn't matter to him.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:11.020]   He wanted to do restitution.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.980]   He wanted to make it right.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:26.720]   And it becomes an immediate expression of a salvation transformation.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:34.780]   And Jesus says in verse 9, "Today salvation has come to this house."
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.580]   Because He too is the Son of Abraham.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.580]   What does that mean?
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.200]   Wasn't He already a Son of Abraham, a Jewish guy?
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:49.800]   Yeah, He was naturally, but not spiritually.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:59.200]   He fits into the category of Romans, chapter 2, verses 28 and 29.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.300]   And you'll remember this, where the apostle Paul says, "He is not a Jew."
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.660]   He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.940]   flesh.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:20.320]   But He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that which is of the heart,
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.500]   by the Spirit.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.440]   You can tell this is not the man He was.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.420]   Something on the inside has changed.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.820]   And Paul says, "I am not a Jew."
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:42.920]   Paul makes it clear in Galatians, as well as in Romans, that if you have trusted Christ,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.320]   you are a son of Abraham.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.580]   You may not be Jewish, but you have followed Abraham's faith.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.560]   You have followed his faith.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:02.420]   In Galatians 3, just to give you another text to look at that, "So," verse 9, "those who
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.460]   are of faith."
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.660]   "Are blessed with Abraham the believer."
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:15.220]   Verse 29, "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants."
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:21.180]   So there's a sense in which all of us, Jew or Gentile, who have come to know the Lord
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.560]   through the gospel and through faith, are children of Abraham.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:32.920]   He's the prototype of faith, and we have followed his pattern.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.

[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.

[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   And we've followed the way of the Lord.
