[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.020]   - Pastor John, you have a new book out,
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.280]   a little 50 page book titled Risk is Right,
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.860]   Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.740]   And one of the more profound points you make in the book,
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.420]   I think, is the idea that safety is a myth.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.180]   I would love for you to unpack this little phrase
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.340]   for us in this podcast.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.140]   What do you mean when you say that safety is a myth?
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.380]   - Well, it's a myth both as experience teaches us
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.540]   and as the Bible teaches us.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.300]   So go with experience first and then the Bible.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.220]   You can't put enough padlocks on your door
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.780]   and enough bars on your window
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.680]   to keep a heart attack from happening.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.980]   There is no guarantee that anybody
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.780]   is going to live another breath.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.380]   And therefore all the efforts that we make
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.380]   to keep ourselves safe are ultimately an illusion
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.540]   in terms of absolute security.
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.340]   Our life is in God's hands.
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.460]   Come now you who say, let's go up to such and such a city
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.300]   and spend a year there and trade and get gain.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.580]   You do not know your life.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.140]   It's like a vapor.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.700]   You are arrogant.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.940]   You ought to say, if the Lord wills,
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.500]   we will live and do this and that.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.040]   So there's no safety in the car to get you there.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.620]   There's no safety in the building while you're there.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.780]   There is no guarantees that you're gonna live.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.940]   So that's what experience teaches us.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.740]   Safety is an illusion in terms of its guarantee.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.580]   The Bible makes it worse for us.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.540]   Jesus said, if they called the master of the house,
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.740]   Beelzebul, how much more are they gonna malign
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.980]   those of his own household?
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.820]   If they persecuted me, they'll persecute you.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.740]   Paul said, through many afflictions,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.820]   you must enter the kingdom.
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.780]   Peter said, don't think it's strange.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380]   If when the fiery ordeal comes upon you.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.620]   In other words, it's not strange.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.340]   It's normal to suffer in this world.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.340]   And Paul says in 2 Timothy 3, verse 12,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.260]   everybody who desires to live a godly life
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.180]   will be persecuted.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.460]   So the New Testament is just replete with promises.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.020]   You're not going to be safe.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.140]   You're going to suffer.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.000]   Take up your cross and follow me.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.740]   Anybody who belongs to a people movement
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.220]   that has a crucified Savior and Lord at the head of it
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.980]   can count on a Calvary road themselves.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.980]   And so my argument is you cannot avoid risk
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.820]   and therefore embrace it for kingdom purposes.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.980]   - Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.140]   So this illusion of safety then is holding a Christian back
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.740]   from taking a risk.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.960]   And what are the risks that you are specifically
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.200]   addressing in this book?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.440]   - Anything that would deter you from doing the will of God
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.920]   because it's negative and it might happen to you.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   Risk is a peculiar thing.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.800]   In order for there to be risk, there has to be ignorance.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   So God can't risk.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.400]   I hear people say God took a big risk in creating humankind.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.560]   He did not.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.880]   Or God took a big risk in sending his son into the world.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.000]   Absolutely, he did not.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.020]   He knew exactly what would happen to his son.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.700]   He knew exactly that we would fall
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.340]   because he was planning redemption
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.660]   long before he created the world.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.360]   The Bible is crystal clear on that.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.800]   God was never and can never take a risk
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.540]   because risk demands ignorance.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.300]   That is, if you know that you're gonna be shot
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.580]   when you stand in front of your wife,
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.060]   you don't risk being shot.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.100]   You sacrifice yourself, period.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.480]   That's not a risk, that's a sacrifice.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.660]   And so you give your life for her.
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.940]   And that's what Jesus did.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.740]   But most of us live every day
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.580]   not at all sure what will happen to us.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.700]   If we write this letter to our son or daughter
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.960]   to try to witness to them,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.380]   we don't know if it will backfire.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.280]   When we try to witness to somebody at work,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.900]   we don't know how it will go or whether they'll criticize it
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.140]   or whether we'll lose our job.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.300]   When a person goes over the field in the missions field,
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.220]   he doesn't know whether he's gonna be arrested.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.100]   There's just a thousand things
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.500]   that we don't know might happen to us.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   And my point in this book is we choose to risk.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.420]   We embrace risk.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.900]   We don't minimize risk.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.060]   We walk into risk.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.860]   And the way we decide what's right risk
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.020]   and what's wrong risk is that the greater the outcome
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.620]   that we hope for, the greater the risk it's right to take.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.620]   And the greater the likelihood of harm,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.640]   the greater the outcome you better be aiming at.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.620]   Which is why I think a lot of risk
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.780]   that people take is just dead wrong.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.740]   I mean, I'll give you my own personal bias.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.180]   I think taking life-threatening risks
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.860]   for sheer pleasure is wrong.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.300]   So I wouldn't, it's gonna really offend some people,
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.780]   I wouldn't skydive and I wouldn't hang glide
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.740]   for just sheer pleasure.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.740]   Simple reason, one simple malfunction, you're dead.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.660]   For what reason?
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.020]   Fun, that's a bad idea.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.660]   Whereas I would support skydiving and hang gliding
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.140]   in order to accomplish some great goal for another person,
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.340]   some sacrificial goal.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.380]   Everybody knows that driving a car down the road
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.620]   is taking a risk, but we do it because number one,
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.220]   getting somewhere is valuable and the risk is small.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.220]   Same thing with getting on an airplane.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.260]   You risk your life getting on an airplane.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.180]   I think getting on an airplane just for fun
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.500]   would probably be foolish.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.300]   But getting on an airplane to go somewhere
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.180]   at a certain amount of time with minimal risk
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.460]   and high payoff, that would be right.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.340]   - Okay, so it seems for you then, Pastor John,
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.900]   that risk-taking is quite directly tied to faith.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.900]   - Yes, I think there's a way to take risk
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.300]   as a arrogant and proud glory seeker.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.860]   So I'm not saying that only believers take risk.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.180]   I'm saying the only way to rightly take a risk,
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.460]   the taking of a risk that honors Christ is to say,
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.100]   I love you, I trust you, I believe you're in control.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.320]   Only you can provide the strength to do this
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.660]   and only you will govern the outcome
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.420]   and I am willing to walk into this risk
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.740]   for kingdom purposes and for your glory
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.780]   because I'm trusting you.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.020]   And the reason I can trust you
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.820]   is because you died for me and you rose for me.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.820]   So the gospel is underneath my readiness to risk by faith.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.180]   - Excellent, thank you, Pastor John.
