[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Welcome back to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.720]   We have a question today about the weight of personal accountability that we carry for
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.040]   what we know of God's word.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.400]   It's a short and brief question sent to us from a listener named Kerry in New Mexico.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.760]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.240]   Can you tell me if Jesus is directing his rather harsh words in Luke chapter 12, verses
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.360]   47 and 48 to Christians or to non-Christians?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.480]   I cannot make sense of the context myself.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.120]   Well the way Kerry puts the question is just a little bit tricky because the parable that
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.760]   Jesus just told, he told to Christian disciples.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:56.700]   But the outcome of the parable refers to people who I think are proved not to be Christian
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.700]   disciples.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.280]   So here's, let me just read it and comment as I go so that'll make sense.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.200]   He just told it to them.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:22.720]   The Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his master will set over
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.760]   his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time?"
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   Pause.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:40.520]   In other words, this parable will help you, Peter, know whether you are faithful and wise
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   or unfaithful.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   In other words, he's saying, "Does this apply to us or everybody?"
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.360]   And he's saying, "Do you fit?
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   Do you fit?
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.400]   I mean, if the shoe fits, wear it, Peter."
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.760]   So he keeps going.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.320]   "Blessed, blessed."
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.280]   Now that's what we want to be.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.400]   We don't want to be cursed.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.840]   "Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.560]   Truly I say to you, he will set himself, he will set him over possessions.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.320]   But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in coming and begins to beat the
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.600]   male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk,' the master of that servant
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   will come on a day when he does not expect him and in an hour he does not know and will
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.840]   cut him in pieces and put him..."
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.920]   Here's the closest thing to a direct answer to Cary's question.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.120]   "And will put him with the unfaithful."
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.440]   So that's the closest thing to a direct answer to her question.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   The servant who uses his role in the Christian church under the guise of steward or deacon
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.040]   or overseer or pastor or you, whatever you call it, who uses his position and acts selfishly
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:17.200]   and cruelly, abusively, contrary to the master's wishes, will be put with the unfaithful.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.560]   Doesn't matter how many professions of faith he's made.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.800]   Doesn't matter how many people he led to Christ.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.520]   Doesn't matter how orthodox he is.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   He's going to hell.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.840]   That's what Jesus is saying.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.520]   You will be put with the unfaithful and cut to pieces.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.720]   And now here comes the verse that she's asking about.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:44.200]   Verse 47, "And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.640]   to his will will receive a severe beating.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   But the one who does not know, did not know, and did what deserved a beating," notice those
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.360]   words, very important, they still did what deserved, deserved a beating, "they will receive
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.960]   a light punishment."
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.840]   They will receive a light beating.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   "Everyone to whom much is given, of him much will be required.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.000]   And from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.920]   So my answer to Carrie's question is that the parable is spoken to followers of Jesus,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.120]   but the reason it is spoken to them is to warn them that if they turn their back on
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.840]   their master and start using their reputed role as his servants to act selfishly and
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.560]   abuse those in their charge, he will put their lot with unbelievers.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.480]   And among that group, not all will get the same punishment.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.440]   That's what she's asking about.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.880]   Those are unbelievers, I think, that he's talking about who will not get the same punishment.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.680]   The principle will hold, "To whom much is given, much will be required," and which,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.160]   in this context, means the more knowledge you have of God's will, the more you are accountable
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   for doing it.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.480]   Now, just a few closing thoughts of application.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.840]   I think this text carries a huge implication for understanding the justice of God in dealing
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.000]   with people around the world, some of whom know God only through natural revelation rather
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.480]   than any gospel witness.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.280]   They've never heard the gospel.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.480]   And Romans 1, 18 to 23, says that every human being has enough knowledge of God to be held
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.360]   accountable before him at the judgment day.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:48.000]   But oh, how much more knowledge and more accountability there is for those who have sat under the
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.240]   gospel, maybe even in the pastoral ministry, for years and years and yet have not believed
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.160]   or have not acted in faithfulness on the gospel.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.360]   Whenever people ask me, "What about those who've never heard the gospel?"
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.240]   My answer, based partly on Luke 12, these very verses, is that no one will be judged
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.480]   for not obeying revelation they did not have.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:27.360]   We will all be judged according to the knowledge of the truth we have access to, and all of
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.560]   us, every human being on the planet, have access, Paul says in Romans 1, to the knowledge
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.480]   of God that he is to be thanked and that he is to be glorified with all the implications
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.180]   that carries.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.780]   One more word that seems related.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.680]   Even though believers in Christ, because our sins are covered by the death of Christ, are
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:02.840]   not punished by God at the judgment, nevertheless, there is a kind of what Paul calls suffering
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:11.080]   loss if our lives have been devoted in some measure to false teachings and false ways.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.760]   Here's the verse, 1 Corinthians 3:14, "If the work that anyone has built on the foundation
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.320]   survives, he will receive a reward.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:34.280]   If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.600]   only as through fire."
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:46.520]   So I suspect that even though Christ has borne the punishment of all the sins of all believers,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   nevertheless, this principle of greater or lesser blessing according to how we have handled
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.680]   the revelation available to us applies to believers also.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   Sobering.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.440]   There's a huge weight of accountability that we all bear for what we know.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.080]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that explanation from the text, and thank you for listening
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.000]   and making the podcast part of your week.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.760]   You can read this by email with a question of your own, even questions that relate to
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.920]   things that you read in the Bible that don't quite make sense to you.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.120]   You can do all that through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.480]   Well the New Testament is amazingly clear that we are living in the end times.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.160]   The last chapter of redemptive history, the new creation has been inaugurated.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.660]   And one of the theologians who most helped many of us come to grips with this reality
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.600]   is a former professor of John Piper's.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.520]   And when we return on Wednesday, we're going to talk about George Eldon Ladd and his legacy.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.760]   It's going to be a really interesting look back at a historical influence on John Piper's
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.720]   life and legacy that you won't want to miss.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.160]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast, and we will see you on Wednesday.
