[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.740]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.320]   [upbeat music]
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.420]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.620]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.460]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.280]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.340]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.660]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.320]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.080]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.880]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.560]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   and reach your health goals.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.680]   I've long been a fan of doing blood tests,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440]   and more recently as they've been developed,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   also DNA tests.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.200]   And the reason for that is that so many of the factors
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.760]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.040]   and that inform our health choices
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.640]   can only be analyzed by way of blood or DNA tests.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.160]   The great thing about Inside Tracker
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.780]   is they make getting the blood and DNA tests extremely easy.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.320]   They'll come to your home if you like,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320]   or you can go to a place where you can get your blood drawn
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.840]   and your DNA swab taken there.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.560]   As well, once you get the information back
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.240]   from Inside Tracker, it's very easy to understand
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.440]   what to do with that information, how to interpret it.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.160]   And that's really what sets Inside Tracker apart, I believe,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.120]   from other blood and DNA testing tools and companies.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.640]   Most sources and companies will give you information back
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.320]   about what your levels of hormones are
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.400]   and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.200]   but no clear directives about what to do
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440]   with that information to get those markers
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.480]   in the ranges that you want
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.120]   in order to optimize your health.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.020]   Inside Tracker makes that all very easy.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.720]   It gives you directives about exercise, about nutrition,
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.000]   about various supplements you may or may not want to take.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.320]   And once again, only through blood and DNA tests
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.380]   can you access that information.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.920]   If you want to try Inside Tracker,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.940]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman.

[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.880]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.320]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.560]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.060]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.580]   I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.560]   and I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.720]   because it covers all my nutritional vitamin mineral
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.300]   and probiotic bases.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.880]   Of course, you can get vitamins and minerals
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.480]   and probiotics from food,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.640]   but many of us, including me,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   find it hard to do that on a consistent basis,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.000]   especially when I'm working a lot,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.640]   when stress and sleep aren't optimized, et cetera.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.600]   With Athletic Greens,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.560]   I make sure to get all the things I need
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.120]   and then all the other supplements I take or what I eat,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.560]   I can consider additional insurance.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.960]   The great thing about Athletic Greens is it tastes great.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.200]   I like to mix mine with water
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.460]   and a little bit of lemon juice.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.300]   I take it once early in the day
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.080]   and then sometimes again in the afternoon.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.800]   The fact that it includes probiotics
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.240]   is really important to me.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.060]   There are so many data now pointing to the fact
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.720]   that probiotics and gut brain health
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.120]   and gut health generally are very important
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   for metabolism, for hormone output,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.400]   for neurotransmitter production.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.100]   So many vital things related to our health.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.200]   Athletic Greens makes it easy to make sure
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.700]   that I'm getting everything that I need
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.460]   in the vitamin, mineral and probiotic department.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.880]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.240]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.580]   and claim a special offer.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.140]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.440]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.880]   There's now a ton of data as well
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.240]   pointing to the fact that vitamin D3 and K2
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.800]   are important for a huge number of health related factors,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   including hormones, metabolic factors,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.320]   neurotransmitters, et cetera.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.360]   So they have the year supply of vitamin D3 completely free
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.120]   along with your Athletic Greens offer
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.920]   and you get the five free travel packs.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.020]   So if you'd like to try that,
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.640]   you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.540]   and claim the special offer.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.920]   Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.280]   I started meditating many years ago,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.700]   but I found it was difficult to stay consistent
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.400]   with my meditation practice.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.360]   In fact, when I would get stressed or really busy,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.000]   that's when I probably needed
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.360]   the meditation practice the most
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.260]   and that's when I tended to drop the meditation practice
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.580]   and run around doing other things.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.720]   So it was really a kind of catch 22.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.400]   I learned about Headspace a few years ago
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   on JetBlue flights when they had them included
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.020]   as an option of whether or not to watch a movie
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.040]   or a television show or do meditation.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.120]   I tried the meditation and I really liked it.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.520]   Very easy to follow along with a Headspace meditation.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   The meditations that they include on the Headspace app
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.100]   are also backed by dozens of peer reviewed
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.840]   quality independent studies.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.520]   And of course there are now thousands
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.060]   of peer reviewed quality studies pointing to the fact
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.920]   that a meditation practice is beneficial
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.520]   for sake of improved sleep, for reducing stress
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.140]   and a number of other health metrics,
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.240]   cardiovascular disease, risk, et cetera.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.680]   The great thing about Headspace is it's allowed me
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.900]   to stay really consistent with my meditation practice.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.200]   They have meditations of different duration
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.420]   and different type, so you never get bored.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.380]   I actually look forward to my meditation practice
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.140]   and it continues to benefit me.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.620]   In fact, since starting Headspace,
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.660]   I've been consistent with meditation for much longer
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.500]   than I ever had previously.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.760]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.140]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.460]   and you'll get a free one month trial
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.760]   with Headspace's full library of meditations
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.120]   for every situation.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   That's headspace.com/specialoffer
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.800]   to get a one month free trial.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.820]   That's their best offer out there right now.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.060]   And then you can try their full library of meditations
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.560]   for every situation.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.500]   Today, we're going to continue our discussion about hormones
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.620]   and we're going to focus on how particular hormones
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.680]   influence our energy levels and our immune system.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.740]   Now, last episode, I mentioned at the end
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.980]   that we were concluding our month on hormones,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.060]   but we decided to include this additional episode.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.740]   So this would be the fifth episode
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.040]   in the sequence of episodes about hormones
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.100]   because there are two hormones which are vitally important
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.560]   for a huge number of biological functions
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.220]   that we will talk about today,
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.020]   but that are particularly important for energy levels
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.220]   and your immune system.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.740]   This is something that I get asked about a lot.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.900]   So rather than skip to the next general topic,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.220]   today, we're going to talk about the hormones cortisol
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.540]   and epinephrine, also called adrenaline.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.260]   You do not have to have heard the previous episodes
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.380]   on hormones in order to understand and digest the material
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.180]   from today's podcast.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.780]   If I mentioned anything related to previous episodes,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.000]   I promise to give a little bit of quick background
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.820]   to get everyone up to speed.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.680]   Today, we're going to talk about the biology of cortisol.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.040]   We're going to talk about the biology of epinephrine.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.360]   As always, we'll talk mechanism
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.460]   and there are going to be a lot of tools.
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.660]   If you're somebody who struggles with stress
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.640]   and energy levels and balancing stress and energy levels,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.440]   today's episode is going to be vital for you.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.280]   If you're somebody who has challenges with sleep
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.540]   or you're somebody who has challenges
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.620]   getting your energy level up throughout the day
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.180]   and getting your energy level down when you want to sleep,
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.100]   today's episode is also for you.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.380]   And we're going to talk about the immune system
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.180]   and how to enhance the function of your immune system.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.140]   We're also going to get into some fun topics
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.900]   related to learning and memory
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.140]   and how you can leverage cortisol
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.680]   and epinephrine in particular in order to learn faster.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.160]   We're going to talk about so-called nootropics, smart drugs,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.240]   and how they work because there are several of them
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.420]   that tap into the epinephrine system
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.700]   that aren't often discussed and that you have access to.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.060]   We're going to talk about how caffeine
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.620]   can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.260]   And we're going to talk about the biology of comfort foods
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.140]   and why they work so well and what they're doing.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.660]   And in understanding that,
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.980]   you'll be able to better understand your food choices
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.500]   as they relate to short-term and long-term energy.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.820]   So we have a lot to cover.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.260]   Everything will be timestamped.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.720]   I want to just remind people that we caption every episode
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.780]   in English and in Spanish.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.640]   The captions take a day or two to pop up on YouTube.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.340]   So if you're not seeing those within the first couple days,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.460]   please be patient with us in order to get captions
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.220]   that actually read similarly to what I'm saying.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.020]   We go through a captioning service
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.560]   and so we have them done by experts
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.880]   and that takes a little bit of additional time.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.540]   Meanwhile, if you have any questions
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.560]   as the episode evolves, please write them down,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.140]   please put them in the comment section,
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.700]   please subscribe to the channel if you haven't already,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.460]   and let's get started talking about
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.020]   how to increase your energy and improve
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.980]   and increase your immunity by leveraging the biology
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.660]   of cortisol and adrenaline.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.700]   Before we dive into the biology of increasing energy
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.040]   and your immune system, I want to cover three topics
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.660]   that I promised I would mention from previous episodes.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.000]   The first one relates to intermittent fasting.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.580]   The second one relates to why your stomach grumbles.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.140]   I forgot to mention the biology of that last time.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.480]   And the third is a powerful way to increase growth hormone,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.660]   which is powerful for increasing metabolism,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.700]   fat burning and tissue repair, et cetera,
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.600]   that doesn't involve a sauna
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.060]   or wrapping yourself in plastic bags and going for a jog.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.900]   So first, intermittent fasting.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.100]   Last episode, I talked a lot about growth hormone
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.900]   and thyroid hormone and I mentioned things like sauna
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   and exercise and sleep and how they can increase levels
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.820]   of growth hormone within the healthy ranges
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.380]   and why increasing growth hormone can be very beneficial
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.780]   because it can burn off body fat,
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.020]   it can improve muscle and general tissue health,
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.380]   cartilage, et cetera, and we tend to lose
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.220]   or our levels of growth hormone are reduced as we age.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.420]   Many people ask me, well, what about fasting?
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.460]   Everyone's been promised on the internet
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.460]   that intermittent fasting leads to these big increases
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.020]   in growth hormone.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.380]   The reason I didn't mention it is that I couldn't find
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.720]   a study that actually pointed to the underlying mechanism.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.480]   I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.280]   lots of degrees behind people's names,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.840]   sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely different fields
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.060]   talking about this, but very few studies.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.680]   And then I found what I would consider the study.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.140]   We will link to this study.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.940]   Turns out that fasting does increase growth hormone levels
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.740]   and the way that it does it is fascinating.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.240]   I mentioned in a previous podcast about hunger
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.540]   and timing of meals and timing of hunger
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.660]   that when you're hungry, you release a hormone
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.260]   in your body called ghrelin,
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.020]   sometimes actually called ghrelin.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.680]   Thanks for all of you ghrelinistas or ghrelinistas
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.960]   that corrected my pronunciation.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.040]   It's both ghrelin or ghrelin, either one works.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.600]   Ghrelin makes you hungry.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.240]   When blood glucose, your blood sugar is low,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.420]   ghrelin is secreted and makes you hungry.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.460]   And it turns out that ghrelin, this hunger hormone,
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.720]   actually binds to the receptor in the brain
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.280]   that normally binds what's called growth hormone
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.480]   releasing hormone.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.160]   So believe it or not, the hunger hormone
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.360]   can act like growth hormone releasing hormone
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.200]   and thereby stimulate growth hormone.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.660]   Now, the levels of growth hormone that fasting promotes
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.040]   through this ghrelin system are pretty substantial.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.180]   It's about a doubling of growth hormone levels
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.920]   in the waking state.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.380]   So we know that you can release growth hormone in sleep.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.100]   Intermittent fasting, it turns out,
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.860]   can increase growth hormone by binding ghrelin
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.520]   to the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.380]   And it does it also during the daytime.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.340]   So yes, indeed, fasting can increase growth hormone,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.540]   not to the supra levels that taking growth hormone
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.560]   would increase it or that a sauna could increase it,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.560]   but it does seem to increase growth hormone.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.020]   Later in today's episode,
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.880]   we're going to talk a lot about different patterns
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.540]   of fasting and eating that can control epinephrine.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.600]   And so we will return to specifics about how long a fast.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.320]   You need to fast for two or three days or 23 hours.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.680]   Fortunately, for people like me who love to eat,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.940]   that's not the case.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.040]   So we'll talk specific fasting protocols
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.160]   later in the episode.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.520]   We also said we were going to talk about tummy grumble.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.480]   When your stomach growls,
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.800]   it is not because of fluid sifting around in there.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.200]   A lot of people think, oh, you know,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.080]   it's fluid sifting around.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.760]   It turns out that your stomach has smooth muscle
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.940]   that lines its sides.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.000]   And when you eat something or you don't,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.840]   every once in a while,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.920]   your stomach cinches off at the two ends
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.240]   like a bag with a hose on either end,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.820]   'cause that's essentially what your digestive system is.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.620]   And if there's nothing in there,
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.040]   what happens is the muscles
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.160]   that line the sides of your stomach,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.320]   they kind of extend around the stomach in these cables.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.400]   Those are always there.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.320]   And if you have food in your stomach,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.960]   what they do is they churn your stomach.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.920]   They literally turn the muscles of your stomach
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.240]   like a tumbler to help break up the food
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.020]   that presumably you didn't chew well enough
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.620]   'cause you were eating too fast.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.980]   When you don't have any food in your stomach,
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.400]   that churning continues.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.860]   And that contraction of the muscle
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.460]   and the turning, literally turning over of your muscles,
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.880]   they don't flip over completely,
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.080]   but the turning over the muscles,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.900]   that's what causes the stomach growling.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.200]   If you don't want to be the person in the meeting
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.440]   or sitting there in a quiet theater
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.820]   whose stomach is growling, chew your food better.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.340]   That's the simple solution.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.220]   And last episode,
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.780]   I talked a lot about how sauna controlled safe hyperthermia
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.420]   can cause huge increases in growth hormone release,
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.660]   anywhere from 300 to 500,
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.420]   even 1,600% increases in growth hormone release,
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.780]   really staggeringly high increases.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.980]   I point out that many people don't have saunas
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.740]   in their yard or in their homes,
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.840]   and they would go through some other measures
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.300]   to increase safely their body heat,
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.000]   creating a steam room in their bathroom
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.100]   or jogging with extra sweats on, this kind of thing.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.860]   Many of you asked about hot baths.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.080]   Hot baths will increase growth hormone, excuse me.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.220]   However, the temperatures that you need
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.640]   in order to increase growth hormone
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.820]   are high enough that you run the risk of burn.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.820]   And so I really can't make any recommendations
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.640]   about hot baths, but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath,
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.560]   you are going to get some growth hormone release.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.260]   However, the sauna has this advantage
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.140]   of you being able to enter 175 degree
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.780]   or 200 degree environment,
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.320]   provided you're not pregnant, you're not a young child,
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   et cetera, you can do that safely.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.360]   And getting big increases in growth hormone,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.940]   the hot bath will lead to lesser increases
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.540]   in growth hormone.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.240]   We're going to talk a lot about temperature regulation
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.780]   in a future episode, but as always,
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.480]   if you're ever going to start playing with hypothermia
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.140]   or hypothermia, cold baths, ice baths, hot showers,
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.020]   hot baths that are beyond the kind of norm
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.880]   of what's comfortable, you have to be extremely careful
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.520]   and please consult a doctor.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.420]   I think it's fair to say that most people
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.460]   would like to have a lot of energy during the day,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.540]   if you work during the day,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.860]   and they'd like their energy to taper off at night.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.700]   And I think it's fair to say that most people
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   don't enjoy being sick, nobody wants to get sick.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.800]   In other words, you want to have energy
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.820]   and you want your immune system to function well,
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.900]   to ward off infections of various kinds,
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.180]   bacterial infections, viral infections, et cetera.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.300]   And it turns out that the two hormones
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.900]   that dominate those processes of having enough energy
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.980]   and having a healthy immune system
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.820]   are cortisol and epinephrine.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.540]   Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.620]   In the body, we tend to call adrenaline adrenaline
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.940]   and in the brain, we tend to call adrenaline epinephrine.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.380]   And I'm sorry for that, I didn't create this naming system.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.620]   And the story behind it is uninteresting
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.620]   and not worth our time.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.540]   I will use the words adrenaline and epinephrine
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.740]   interchangeably today.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.420]   Cortisol is cortisol.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.440]   And I just want to cover a little bit
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.820]   about what cortisol and epinephrine are,
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.060]   where they are released in the body and brain,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.240]   because if you can understand that,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.840]   you will understand better how to control them.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:53.300]   First of all, cortisol is a steroid hormone,
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.880]   much like estrogen and testosterone,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.640]   in that it is derived from cholesterol.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.080]   Now that could be cholesterol that you eat.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.040]   It could be cholesterol that's produced by the liver.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.320]   As many of you probably know,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.760]   the relationship between dietary cholesterol,
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.420]   the fats that you eat and blood cholesterol
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.740]   and liver cholesterol is a very controversial one.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.660]   It's a barbed wire topic.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.680]   There are people that claim that dietary cholesterol
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.400]   has zero impact on circulating cholesterol
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.240]   coming from the liver.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.280]   There are people who argue the exact opposite,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.200]   both with good data in hand, I would say.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.720]   There are some problems for the idea
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.380]   that all your cholesterol levels
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.680]   are determined by dietary intake,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.040]   namely that anorexics often have very high levels
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.660]   of cholesterol that their liver produces,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.100]   even though they are eating very little
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.940]   and sometimes not eating at all.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.340]   So understand that cholesterol is a precursor molecule,
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.580]   meaning it's the substrate from which a lot of things
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.100]   like testosterone and estrogen are made.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.440]   Please also understand that cholesterol
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.680]   can be made into estrogen or testosterone or cortisol,
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.800]   and that cortisol is sort of the competitive partner
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.320]   to estrogen and testosterone.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.380]   What this means is no matter how much cholesterol
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.760]   you're eating or you produce,
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.700]   whether or not it's low or it's high,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.160]   if you are stressed, more of that cholesterol
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.060]   is going to be devoted toward creating cortisol,
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.520]   which is indeed a stress hormone.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.820]   However, the word stress shouldn't stress you out
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.240]   because you need cortisol.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.440]   Cortisol is vital.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.220]   You don't want your cortisol levels to be too low.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.440]   It's very important for immune system function,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.280]   for memory, for not getting depressed.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.120]   You just don't want your cortisol levels to be too high
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.660]   and you don't want them to be elevated
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.900]   even to normal levels at the wrong time of day.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.700]   So we're going to talk about how to control the timing
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.840]   and level of your cortisol.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:59.280]   Epinephrine or adrenaline has also been demonized a bit.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.560]   We think of it as this stress hormone,
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.400]   this thing that makes us anxious, fight or flight.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.560]   We used to get chased by lions and tigers and bears,
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.240]   and now we don't, and it's this ancient hangover.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   That's all wrong.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.200]   The fact of the matter is that epinephrine
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.960]   is your best friend when it comes to your immunity,
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.840]   when it comes to protecting you from infection.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.620]   And we're going to talk about why.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.040]   And epinephrine, adrenaline, is your best friend
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.760]   when it comes to remembering things
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.460]   and learning and activating neuroplasticity.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.940]   We're going to talk about that as well.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.200]   Once again, it's a question of how much and how long
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.040]   and the specific timing of release
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.460]   of cortisol and epinephrine,
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.580]   as opposed to cortisol and adrenaline being good or bad.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.260]   They're terrific when they're regulated.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.420]   They are terrible when they're misregulated.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.380]   And we will give you lots of tools to regulate them better.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.640]   Cortisol biology 101 in less than two minutes.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.440]   Your brain makes what we call releasing hormones.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.200]   And in this case, there's corticotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.160]   CRH, is made by neurons in your brain.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.040]   It causes the pituitary, this gland that sits
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.620]   about an inch in front of the roof of your mouth
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.580]   and the base of your brain, to release ACTH.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.000]   ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.960]   which sit above your kidneys and your lower back,
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.400]   to release cortisol, a so-called stress hormone.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.700]   But I would like you to think about cortisol
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.160]   not as a stress hormone, but as a hormone of energy.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.300]   It produces a situation in the brain and body
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.060]   whereby you want to move
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.080]   and whereby you don't want to rest
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.140]   and whereby you don't want to eat, at least at first.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.220]   Epinephrine or adrenaline 101 in less than two minutes.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.520]   When you sense a stressor with your mind
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.600]   or your body senses a stressor, excuse me,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   from a wound or something of that sort,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   a signal is sent to neurons
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.140]   that are in the middle of your body.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.920]   They're called the sympathetic chain ganglia.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.800]   The name doesn't necessarily matter.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   They release norepinephrine very quickly.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.220]   It's almost like a sprinkler system
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.980]   that just hoses your body with epinephrine.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.500]   That will increase heart rate, will increase breathing rate.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.900]   In some cases, it will constrict your blood vessels.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.420]   It will also increase the size of vessels and arteries
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.960]   that are giving blood flow to your vital organs.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.260]   This is why your extremities get cold when you're stressed
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.580]   and your heart is beating faster.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.880]   More of that energy is being devoted toward your core.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.880]   You also release adrenaline from your adrenals.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.880]   In, again, riding atop your kidneys.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.860]   Those are a second system whereby your system gets flooded
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.860]   with adrenaline in pulses.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.560]   So you can get one pulse, you can get 10 pulses.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.340]   We'll talk about how to regulate the number of pulses.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.160]   And you release it from an area of your brain
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.780]   called locus coeruleus,
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.380]   and that creates alertness in your brain.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.880]   If you want to learn more about the stress response
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.240]   and all the details of that,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.420]   including some protocols of how to regulate stress,
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.320]   please see our episode about stress.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.360]   I go into a lot of detail there.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.540]   I will touch on some of the same themes today,
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.640]   but I really want to cover energy and the immune system.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.220]   And if you're very much interested in stress per se
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.720]   and stress regulation, please see the episode on stress.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.180]   Okay, so we have cortisol and we have epinephrine,
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.380]   and their net effect is to increase energy.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.500]   So first of all, I want to give you a tool
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   that will help you regulate cortisol
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.260]   and can also help stave off certain patterns
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.100]   of mental illness.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.820]   Now, of course, it's not going to cure mental illness
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.340]   on its own, but it can support healthy state of mind
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.700]   and can help reduce unhealthy states of mind,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.260]   including depression.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.980]   So the first tool is to make sure
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.400]   that your highest levels of cortisol
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.960]   are first thing in the morning when you wake up.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.420]   One way or another, every 24 hours,
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.520]   you will get an increase in cortisol.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.780]   That is non-negotiable.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.220]   That is written into your genome.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.420]   That increase in cortisol is there to wake you up
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.980]   and to make you alert.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.020]   It's to stimulate movement from being asleep,
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.700]   presumably horizontal, to getting up
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.000]   and starting to move about your day.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.460]   And I've said it before, but I will say it again,
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.060]   the best way to stimulate that increase in cortisol
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.700]   at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking,
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.300]   within 30 minutes or so after waking,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.460]   get outside, view some sunlight.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.160]   Even if it's overcast, get outside, view some sunlight,
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.620]   no sunglasses, never look at any light so bright
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.540]   that it could damage your eyes,
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.020]   but do that for two to 10 minutes.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.300]   If it's very bright, two minutes.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.660]   If it's not so bright, 10 minutes.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.740]   Do that because in the early part of the day,
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.260]   you have the opportunity to time that cortisol release
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.900]   to the early part of the day, which will improve,
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.640]   this has been backed by peer-reviewed studies,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.300]   it will improve your focus,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.460]   it will improve your energy levels,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.460]   and it will improve your learning throughout the day.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.460]   It will also prevent a late shift in cortisol increase.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.260]   And late shifted cortisol,
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.140]   meaning cortisol that increases around eight or 9 p.m.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.740]   is a signature feature of many depressive disorders,
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.540]   including major depression, anxiety,
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.740]   and that of course correlates
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.740]   with things like insomnia, et cetera.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.800]   So that's a key tool,
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.580]   and I don't know how many of you are already doing that,
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.420]   but it is vital to do.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.340]   Now I mentioned sunlight even on cloudy days,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.900]   and there are specific reasons for that.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.000]   So I want to just briefly cover the data
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.680]   because in the episodes on sleep,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.220]   I talked about brightness of light
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.600]   in regulating cortisol in sleep,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.900]   and I talked about how to measure lux, brightness,
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.900]   but I was not specific enough, I realized,
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.460]   based on the questions that I've received
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.500]   since that episode.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.160]   So here's how it works.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.940]   Going outside and getting some sunlight
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.540]   requires that I also tell you
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.240]   how long and under what conditions.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.420]   I've said looking through a window is not as good.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.860]   It takes 50 times longer to get as much light,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.900]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.180]   Many, many questions have told me
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.620]   that I'm not being specific enough.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.100]   So I'm going to give you the data,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.780]   and from the data, you will understand
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.660]   exactly how long you need to do this each day.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.440]   On a sunny day, so no cloud cover,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.940]   provided that the sun is not yet overhead,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.600]   it's somewhere low in the sky,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.920]   could have just crossed the horizon,
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.000]   or if you wake up a little bit later,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.800]   it could be somewhat low in the sky.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.040]   Basically, the intensity of light,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.960]   the brightness is somewhere around 100,000 lux.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.180]   Lux is just a measurement of brightness.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.440]   If you want to download the app Light Meter,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.500]   that is a free app that will allow you to do that.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.320]   You can hold your finger down on the little button there,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.480]   and you can move it around,
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.280]   and it will continuously give you a lux readout.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.500]   It's not perfect, it's not exact,
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.260]   but it's pretty good, and it is zero cost.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.260]   I have no relationship to Light Meter, the company.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.020]   On a cloudy day, it's about 10,000 lux, okay?
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.200]   So 10-fold reduction.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.960]   But bright artificial light, very bright artificial light,
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.500]   is somewhere around 1,000 lux.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.140]   And ordinary room light
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.780]   is somewhere around 100 to 200 lux.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.920]   And it has to do with how much light scatter there is.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.420]   So even if you have a very bright bulb
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.700]   sitting right next to you, that's not going to do the job.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.360]   Your phone will not do the job, not early in the day.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.660]   To get the cortisol released at the appropriate time,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.380]   you need to get outside.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.660]   So let's just set a couple general parameters.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.340]   If it's bright outside and no cloud cover,
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.720]   the light can be indirect.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.020]   You don't have to be staring into the sun.
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.360]   Please don't damage your eyes.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.240]   We can't regenerate those neurons yet
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.060]   and restore vision that's lost.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.460]   But if you have to blink, that means it's too bright.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.820]   It's fine to blink, of course.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.820]   Please do if you need to.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.440]   Get outside for 10 minutes.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.220]   Or five minutes should suffice,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.640]   but 10 minutes is sure to suffice.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.240]   If it's a cloudy day, dense overcast,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.340]   you're probably going to need about 30 minutes.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.140]   If it's light cloud, broken cloud cover,
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.240]   it's probably going to be somewhere
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.220]   between 10 and 20 minutes.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.580]   And if you can't get outside or you're on an airplane
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.980]   and it's bright overhead artificial lights
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.540]   or ordinary room lights,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.260]   it's going to take you about six hours of light.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.060]   And by time you reach the middle
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.740]   of your sort of wakeful period, it's too late.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.000]   You won't be able to shift your clock
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.340]   and your cortisol will start drifting later and later.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.220]   This is why it's vital to get this light on a regular basis
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.700]   to get that cortisol released early in the day.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.580]   That sets you up for optimal levels of energy.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.420]   It sets you up for great sleep,
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.740]   but today's not really about sleep.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.820]   It's more about energy.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.300]   That cortisol pulse and the stress that you might feel
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.700]   early in the day from having a little bit extra energy,
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.140]   that is the energy that you want in order to move about
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.900]   and learn and do various things.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.080]   That is a healthy level of energy.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.120]   So please try and get that sunlight
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.700]   if it's within your protocols to do that
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.140]   and try and get sufficient sunlight
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.460]   first thing in the morning, again, within the first hour.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.780]   That's the best way to make sure
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.260]   that you time your cortisol appropriately.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.180]   Now, throughout the day,
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.860]   you're going to experience different things.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.860]   Most of you are not spending your entire day
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.540]   trying to optimize your health.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.320]   Some of you might be, but most of you have jobs
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.520]   and you have families and you have commitments.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.980]   Life enters the picture and provides you stressors.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.620]   And those stressors, whatever they may happen to be,
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.180]   a difficult coworker, some disappointment about something,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.700]   you didn't get the raise you expected
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.260]   or you didn't get the vacation that you expected,
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.780]   those will cause increases in cortisol and epinephrine.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.500]   This is important to understand.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.480]   You don't have the luxury
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.140]   of just having this morning cortisol
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.580]   and then having it taper off.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.880]   You want that major cortisol early in the day,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.820]   but then you can expect, you should expect,
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.960]   increases in cortisol and adrenaline throughout the day
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.180]   based on events that are unpleasant to you.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.420]   So for me, the events that are most unpleasant to me
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.380]   are things like traffic,
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.560]   emails that ask me to fill out a form
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.100]   for which I can't find the link.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.660]   These kinds of things stress me out.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.840]   I'm a human being.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.380]   I don't lose my cool over them,
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.960]   but I can feel my level of alertness
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.340]   and kind of frustration increase.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.420]   The normal kind of things that go with stress
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.560]   tense up a little bit.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.060]   The key is these blips in cortisol and epinephrine
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.860]   need to be brief.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.920]   You can't have them so often or lasting so long
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.380]   that you are in a state of chronic cortisol elevation
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.960]   or chronic epinephrine elevation.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.520]   This system of stress was designed
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.180]   to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things,
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.500]   get you frustrated and provide the opportunity
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.420]   to change behavior.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.580]   That's what they were designed to do.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.540]   So if you find yourself getting stressed
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.780]   and staying stressed,
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.740]   there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.400]   that relate to things like the double inhale exhale,
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.980]   the so-called physiological sigh,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.460]   you can incorporate an NSDR,
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.100]   a non-sleep deep rest protocol, et cetera,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.600]   but understand that the energy
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.200]   that you experience during stress,
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.940]   that sudden increase in alertness and attention
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.920]   that comes from seeing something difficult,
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.260]   that is a healthy hormonal system
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.660]   and neural system that's working.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.720]   And the reason it works is that cortisol,
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.480]   when it's released into the bloodstream,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.920]   it actually can bind to receptors in the brain.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.660]   It can bind receptors in the amygdala,
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.340]   fear centers and threat detection centers,
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.320]   but also areas of the brain that are involved in learning
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.300]   and memory and neuroplasticity.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.540]   And this is why I say that neuroplasticity,
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.900]   the brain's ability to change itself
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.380]   in response to experience is first stimulated
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.980]   by attention and focus
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.020]   and often a low level state of agitation.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.300]   So understand that, and you won't be quite so troubled
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.060]   about the little stress increases
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.100]   that you experience throughout the day.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.620]   Now, there are ways to leverage stress,
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.180]   epinephrine and cortisol in ways that serve you
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.020]   and to do it in a deliberate way.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.300]   There are also ways to do that
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.060]   that increase your level of stress threshold,
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.920]   meaning they make it less likely
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.940]   that epinephrine and cortisol will be released.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.140]   So I want to talk about the science of those practices
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.420]   'cause I get asked about these practices a lot.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.220]   Things like Wim Hof breathing,
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.980]   which is also called Tummo breathing,
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.300]   things like ice baths,
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.100]   things like high intensity interval training.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.860]   All of those things have utility.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.820]   The question is how you use them
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.100]   and how often you use them.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.500]   Those tools, just like stress from a life event,
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.280]   can either enhance your immunity or deplete it.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.960]   That's right, those same practices of ice baths,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.500]   Tummo breathing, high intensity interval training
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.960]   or training of any kind can deplete your immune system
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.420]   or it can improve them.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.160]   Excuse me, they can improve it,
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.960]   meaning they can improve your immune system.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.200]   The key is how often you use them and when.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.860]   And so I want to review that now
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.040]   in light of the scientific literature,
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.960]   because in doing that,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.320]   you can build practices into your daily
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.180]   or maybe every other day routine
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.860]   that can really help buffer you
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.940]   against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine,
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.580]   meaning cortisol increases that are much too great
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.300]   or that last much too long.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.580]   Epinephrine increases that are much too great
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.320]   or that last much too long.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.460]   And of course, we'll talk about all the negatives
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.340]   that go along with having too much cortisol,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.220]   too much epinephrine for too long,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.660]   but you hear about those a lot.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.760]   You hear about Cushing syndrome,
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.260]   you hear about abdominal fat accumulation,
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.780]   you hear about sleep disturbances.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.780]   I want to arm you with the tools first
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.580]   and then we can talk about the dark side
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.500]   and all the things that hopefully
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.180]   you'll be able to avoid entirely
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.400]   or that you can get yourself out of
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   once you have the tools in hand.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.340]   Let's say somebody tells you something very troubling
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.540]   or you look at your phone and you see a text message
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.220]   that's really upsetting to you.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.300]   That will cause an immediate increase
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.260]   in epinephrine, adrenaline in your brain and body.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.260]   And chances are it's going to increase
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.860]   your levels of cortisol as well.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.480]   Let's say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.160]   Even if you love the cold or if you hate the cold,
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.980]   that will cause an equivalent increase
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.300]   in epinephrine and cortisol.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.560]   We don't know the exact levels,
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.660]   but it's probably about the same.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.840]   Let's say you go out for high intensity interval training.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.800]   You decide you're going to run some sprints.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.180]   You can do some repeats
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.360]   or you're going to do some weightlifting in the gym
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.640]   and you love lifting weights in the gym.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.380]   Maybe you're like the powerlifting thing
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.860]   or you decide that you want to do some hot yoga
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.560]   or something that you really enjoy or you hate.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.380]   You're going to increase your epinephrine
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.600]   and cortisol levels.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.460]   There's simply no way around this.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.820]   Let's say you decide to sit down
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.880]   and you're going to do some deep breathing.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.720]   We all hear about the benefits of deep breathing.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.940]   So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.760]   You're going to get big increases
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.880]   in epinephrine and cortisol.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.500]   The data from multiple studies support this.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.860]   All of those are stressors in air quotes.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.340]   Now there is a way that you can cognitively reframe
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.180]   what those are.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.020]   You can tell yourself,
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.240]   I love high intensity interval training
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.760]   or I love weight training or I personally love exercise.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.600]   I'm not crazy about the cold.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.840]   I do some cold exposure stuff now and again.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.600]   And we're going to talk a lot about how to do that
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.960]   in the optimal way in an upcoming episode.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.160]   But getting into the cold doesn't feel good to me.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.640]   I tell myself it's good for me and I enjoy it
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.520]   at some point usually when I'm getting out.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.040]   All of those increase epinephrine and guess what?
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.200]   They increase your levels of energy and alertness.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.060]   So if you're somebody who struggles
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.060]   with energy and alertness,
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.740]   it can be beneficial provided you get clearance
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.200]   from your doctor to have some sort of protocol
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.080]   built into your day where you deliberately increase
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.700]   your levels of epinephrine and your levels of cortisol.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.280]   And I want to put the emphasis on deliberately.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.720]   So how would you do that?
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.100]   Well, it's quite easy to turn the shower cold
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:08.940]   and get into that.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.400]   That will wake you up and it literally wakes you up
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.160]   because of increases in epinephrine.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.600]   You can do deep breathing of the sort
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.880]   where you inhale and exhale repeatedly 25 or 30 times.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.600]   Maybe hold your breath for a few seconds on an exhale
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.280]   and then repeat so-called Wim Hof or Tummo type breathing.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.520]   Lots of adrenaline is released into your system
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.360]   when you do that.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.840]   You'll have more energy afterwards.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.720]   So it's really important to understand
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.640]   that the body doesn't distinguish
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.920]   between a troubling text message, ice, Tummo breathing
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.200]   or high intensity interval training
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   or any other kind of exercise.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.900]   It's all stress.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.360]   Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself,
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.760]   I like this, I enjoy it,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.040]   is not going to change the way that that molecule
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.160]   impacts your body and brain.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.700]   I sort of chuckle because people would love to tell you
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.880]   that all you have to do is say, oh, this is good for me.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.100]   No, what it does to tell yourself that it's good for you
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.360]   or that you enjoy it is that it liberates other molecules
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.680]   like dopamine and serotonin
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.040]   that help buffer the epinephrine response.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.440]   Now, the way that it does that,
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.840]   I've talked about previous episode,
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.000]   but I'll just mention that dopamine
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.080]   is the precursor to epinephrine.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.440]   Epinephrine, adrenaline is made from dopamine.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.500]   Cortisol is made from cholesterol.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.920]   Epinephrine is made from dopamine.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.400]   And that's why if you tell yourself
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.180]   you're enjoying something
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.080]   and because dopamine is so subjective,
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.120]   that you can in some ways,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.880]   as long as you're not completely lying to yourself,
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.060]   you can get more epinephrine.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.660]   You get more mileage or more ability
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.000]   to push through something and you can sort of reframe it,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.800]   but it's not really cognitive reframing.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.480]   The cognitive part is the trigger,
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.960]   but it's a chemical substance
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.300]   that's actually occurring there.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.820]   It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine,
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.420]   a bigger amplitude epinephrine release,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.120]   and it gives you some sense of control.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.520]   So here's a protocol that anyone can use
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.280]   if you want to increase levels of energy,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.520]   if you suffer from low energy during the daytime
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.360]   or whenever it is that you'd like to be alert.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.360]   Pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently,
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.660]   maybe every day,
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.280]   but maybe every third day or every fourth day.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.760]   Maybe it's an ice bath or a cold bath.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.260]   Maybe it's a cold shower.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.780]   Maybe it's the cyclic inhale exhale breathing protocol
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.380]   I described, if that wasn't clear,
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.700]   and people always ask for a demo,
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.440]   I'm not going to do the whole thing right now,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.380]   but I'm willing to do a few rounds of this
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.780]   or a few cycles, I should say.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.720]   So it's inhale.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.940]   I would do that more deeply,
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.880]   more like you do that 25, 30 times repeatedly,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.480]   you will start to feel warm.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.820]   People in the yoga community,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.960]   they say you're generating heat.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.600]   If you're not generating heat, releasing adrenaline.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.900]   Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, 25 or 30 times,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.600]   you will feel agitated and stressed.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.260]   That's because you're releasing adrenaline in your body
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.520]   and that's because you're releasing norepinephrine
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.800]   in your brain and you'll be more alert.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.240]   Then you can follow that 25 or 30 breath cycles
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.160]   with an exhale hold and hold your breath
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.820]   for 15 to 30 seconds.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.860]   Always, always, always do this on dry land,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.880]   never while driving, operating heavy machinery,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.480]   all the standard safety protocols, never near water, please.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.120]   People have passed out and died doing this
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.680]   with breath holds in water.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   There are several deaths associated with it.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.040]   On land, it's probably safer, clear it with your doctor,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.580]   but 25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.000]   25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.960]   25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.640]   And then if you like, you can do an inhale and hold
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.300]   if that's within your margins of safety.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.960]   So if all these protocols,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.720]   all these activities are just equivalent,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.000]   they're just stress, then how do we make them good for us?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.920]   How do we actually benefit from them?
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.960]   Now, of course, the cold itself
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.000]   can have some health promoting effects.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.280]   It can increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.560]   high intensity interval training or other forms of exercise,
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.640]   of course has cardiovascular effects that can be good for us
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.320]   as does weight training, et cetera.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.080]   But what we're talking about here
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.580]   are ways to increase energy and to teach our brain and body,
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.080]   to teach ourselves how to regulate the stress response.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.480]   So in addition to the benefits of the actual practices,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.940]   what we're talking about is building a system
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.920]   so that when you experience increases
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.720]   in epinephrine and cortisol from life events,
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.500]   you're able to better buffer those.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.320]   And we are also talking about
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.120]   ways that you can increase energy overall,
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.100]   'cause that's what today's episode is all about,
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.100]   energy and the immune system.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.700]   And indeed, we will talk about
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.080]   how you can actually leverage specific protocols
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.860]   to increase your immune system on demand.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.340]   There's great scientific data to support
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.340]   that one can do that.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.620]   So there's a biological mechanism that's very important
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.180]   if you want to do those things,
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.960]   increase energy and your immune system on demand,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.660]   learn to buffer stress on demand in real time.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.180]   And it means taking these protocols,
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.980]   these practices, whether or not it's cold water
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.280]   or ice bath or exercise or any of those,
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.580]   and making one small but very powerful adjustment
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.020]   in how you perform them.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.760]   But in order to make that adjustment,
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.700]   I can't just tell you the adjustment,
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.180]   I have to tell you the mechanism
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.740]   so that you know if you're doing it correctly or not.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.020]   This is really a case where
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.780]   if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.780]   you will be far better off than just adopting protocols.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.140]   So if you take away nothing else from this episode,
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.500]   except what I'm about to tell you,
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.300]   please take away the information I'm about to tell you.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.860]   Cortisol, as I mentioned, is released from the adrenals
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.660]   and it can bind to receptors.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.060]   It can have action both in the body and in the brain.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.620]   In fact, it can bind the so-called
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.680]   threat detection center in the brain,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.940]   or one of them, which is the amygdala,
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.340]   also called the fear center.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.060]   It can do that because cortisol can cross the blood
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.880]   brain barrier, it can be released in the body
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.100]   and cross this biological barrier.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.500]   It's like a fence that keeps things out of the brain,
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.680]   but cortisol has passing rights, it can go through.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.620]   Epinephrine cannot, epinephrine is polarized.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.380]   The shape of it is such that it can't make it
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.500]   through the blood brain barrier.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.700]   That's one of the reasons why it's released
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.900]   both from the adrenals in your body
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.940]   and released from this brainstem area, the locus coeruleus,
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.780]   in your brain.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:46.480]   That's a powerful thing because what it means is that
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.860]   the body can enter states of readiness and alertness
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.920]   while the mind remains calm.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.820]   That is biologically possible.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.860]   It's not just a psychological trick.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.080]   And there are ways that one can do that.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.860]   So I'm presuming at this point that
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.020]   you're getting your morning light
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.420]   to time your cortisol increase.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.980]   I'm presuming that you want more energy
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.180]   or that you want to increase your immune system's function
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.820]   and its ability to combat infections of various kinds.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.300]   And what I'm suggesting is that you pick from the palette
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.180]   of exercises that are out there
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.980]   or tools that are out there to increase epinephrine.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.900]   There are a lot of ways to do that.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.160]   You can do that, as I mentioned, through cold water,
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.460]   through exercise, you can even do that
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.780]   by having confrontations with other people.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.360]   At a biological level, it is identical.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.500]   So if you like to go online and place the kind of comments
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.180]   that will read the kinds of things
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.840]   or look at the kinds of things that agitate you,
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.260]   you can, if you like, look at that as an opportunity.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.540]   I'm not suggesting you do that.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.800]   I'd like to see people taking care of themselves
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.140]   and each other in much less destructive ways, frankly.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:01.140]   But the prerequisite here is getting an increase
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.300]   in adrenaline released from the body.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.860]   Now, the simplest way to describe how to do that
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.620]   would be in the context of cold water
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.940]   or a breathing protocol,
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.340]   because then I don't have to deal
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:15.880]   with the unknown life circumstances that get you triggered,
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.820]   or I could tell you what gets me triggered,
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.060]   but I'm not going to.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.660]   So let's presume cold water.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.340]   So let's say you decide you're going to take a cold shower.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.180]   You get into the cold shower, and if it's cold enough,
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.100]   that will be stressful.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.800]   You will experience an increase in epinephrine.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.540]   It will increase your alertness.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.280]   Now, you're using this as a practice, as a tool to build,
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.380]   you could call it resilience,
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.560]   but the ability to stay calm in the mind
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.040]   while being stressed in the body, epinephrines in the body.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.600]   And you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.080]   Now, you can do that by telling yourself it's good for you,
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.240]   by emphasizing your exhales,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.880]   anything that you can do to try and stay calm
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.000]   despite the fact that you are
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.500]   in a heightened state of alertness.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.920]   You could do this with exercise, you could do this with music,
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.540]   pretty much anything that will give you
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.500]   a really heightened state of alertness
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.040]   offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.500]   What you're trying to do at a mechanistic level
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.220]   is to have adrenaline released from the adrenals,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.100]   but not have adrenaline epinephrine released
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.540]   from the brainstem to the same degree.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.120]   So you're not just trying to buffer this.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.400]   You're not trying to say, "Oh, this is good for me.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.940]   This is good for me. I'm going to grind this out."
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.620]   You're not trying to grind it out.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.920]   You're trying to move through this calmly
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.460]   while maintaining alertness.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.800]   You're not trying to zone out necessarily,
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.320]   although maybe that helps.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.840]   You're not trying to distract yourself.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.800]   What you're trying to do is shift cognitively
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.320]   your relationship to the somatic,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.600]   to the body stress response.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.040]   Now, I'm sure some of you out there are shouting,
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.840]   "Yeah, that's exactly like whatever, whatever, whatever."
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.680]   I agree.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.640]   This is in many ways a self-directed
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.900]   kind of stress inoculation,
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.080]   but we're not talking about this as stress inoculation.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.820]   We're talking about this as a way
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.200]   to increase energy and focus.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.720]   And the reason is that epinephrine,
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.040]   when released in the body,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.160]   has a profound effect on the immune system.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.980]   And when released in the brain,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.840]   has a profound effect on the ability
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.360]   to learn and remember information and to be alert.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.040]   And so we're talking about splitting the location,
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.680]   separating the location from which
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.420]   you have epinephrine, adrenaline released, okay?
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.260]   So let's say you are doing this practice simply to wake up.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.720]   Okay, cold shower, we'll do that.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.000]   Exercise, we'll do that.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.180]   The ability to stay calm in mind
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.740]   while having heightened levels of adrenaline
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.840]   and presumably cortisol as well in the body,
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.480]   but the cortisol is going to circulate everywhere.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.160]   We'll talk a little bit about cortisol more in a moment.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.760]   You could do that through some self-soothing, calming way.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.080]   That's going to be highly individual.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.040]   You do it by telling yourself you enjoy it, et cetera.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.820]   But what you need to understand is that
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.860]   in the immediate period following that practice,
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.500]   your system, your entire brain and body are different.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:10.160]   Your body is actually primed to resist infection
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.240]   when you have high levels of epinephrine in it
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.800]   for short periods of time.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.740]   So the scientific study that explored
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.540]   how increasing adrenaline in the body
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.700]   can improve immune resistance is grounded
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.400]   in a well-known phenomenon that increases in stress
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.040]   actually protect you against infection in the short term.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.760]   So I want to look at the classic data first,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.920]   describe what was done,
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.100]   and then I want to talk about the more recent study,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.160]   which is immediately actionable.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.200]   There are classic set of studies
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.000]   that are really based mainly on the work
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.520]   of somebody named Bruce McEwen,
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.760]   who was at the Rockefeller University in New York.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.640]   Bruce passed away a few years ago,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.820]   but he had many decades of incredibly impactful work
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.340]   under his belt when he did.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.180]   The work that I'm going to talk about next
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.740]   has been done in humans and has been done in animals
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.560]   and has really explored how inducing stress
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.680]   can enhance the function of the immune system
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.640]   in the short term.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.400]   And when I mean short term, I mean about one to four days.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.440]   I'm not going to go through all the details of the study,
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.300]   but essentially what they were doing
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.920]   was exposing subjects to some sort of infection,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.140]   either bacterial or viral infection, and inducing stress.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.360]   Sounds like a double whammy, right?
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   You think that maybe getting a little electric foot shock
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.360]   or cold water exposure
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.580]   or something to increase your levels of stress
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.760]   in an adrenaline would just make
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.420]   the effects of the infection worse,
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.060]   but no, quite the opposite.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.040]   Brief bouts of stress,
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.640]   which now you should be thinking about
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.220]   in terms of cortisol and epinephrine release,
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:51.880]   were actually able to increase immune system function.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.120]   Now that shouldn't surprise you
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.520]   if you understand a little bit
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.720]   about how epinephrine works in the body and in the brain.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.240]   It essentially is the signal
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.840]   by which the nervous system can inform immune organs,
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.700]   things like the spleen and other organs
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.900]   that make killer cells of various kinds,
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.640]   B cells and T cells,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.320]   to go and combat infections, bacteria and viruses.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.020]   How else would your immune system know
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.380]   that there was an infection?
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.040]   Your immune system can recognize foreign invaders,
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.280]   but the nervous system provides the signal,
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.400]   the sort of alarm signal that liberates the killer cells,
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.060]   that tells them there's a problem
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.120]   and to go seek out the problem, so to speak.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.760]   So the duration here is really important
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   because if stress stayed too high for too long,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.760]   then yes, indeed, stress can hinder the immune response.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.320]   But for a period of about one to four days,
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.100]   it actually can protect you
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.280]   by way of increasing the immune response.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.960]   Now, I can say with certainty
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.400]   that that effect is governed by epinephrine,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.260]   adrenaline released from the adrenals and not from the brain
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.380]   because they actually explored
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.220]   whether or not the effect exists
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.760]   in the presence of what's called an adrenalectomy
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.260]   or removing the adrenals.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.840]   So I should just say without the adrenals,
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.760]   you don't get the effect.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.800]   So we know that that effect
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.720]   comes from adrenaline in the body.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.800]   What does that mean for you?
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.840]   That means if you want to increase your immune system
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.820]   in the short term,
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:27.080]   you want to increase your epinephrine in the short term.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.320]   That's why short bouts of very intense exercise,
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.400]   probably no more than an hour per day,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.880]   provided you're doing everything else right,
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.100]   sleeping and nutrition, et cetera,
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.800]   maybe even shorter bouts of intense exercise
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.160]   or exposure to cold water
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.680]   or the cyclic breathing that I talked about before,
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.740]   because they increase epinephrine,
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.140]   they will bolster the immune system.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.960]   And we all hear these reports every once in a while.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   It seems to be the thing that every once in a while,
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.720]   there'll be an article about how coffee
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.600]   can improve your immune system or something like that.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.000]   Indeed, caffeine can increase epinephrine
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.060]   and dopamine to some extent,
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.840]   but most people are drinking it chronically.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.080]   So its effects are probably due to increases in epinephrine
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.520]   and probably whether or not something like coffee
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.320]   or other forms of caffeine can improve
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.800]   or degrade your immune system
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.500]   will probably depend on whether or not
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.020]   you're using it in a way that it increases your adrenaline
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.520]   as a spike that happens rarely.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.960]   Once every two or three months,
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.400]   let's say you have an infection coming on.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.200]   Yes, indeed, what these data probably mean
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.920]   is that drinking some hot caffeinated tea
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.520]   or some hot coffee even,
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.500]   provided you don't get dehydrated from it
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.120]   'cause you're also drinking some water
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.340]   can probably improve your immune system function
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.920]   by way of increasing adrenaline release.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.800]   But so can the breathing, so can cold exposure,
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.940]   so can exercise.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.640]   The mechanism here is what's key.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.840]   And I keep saying that because what it means is that
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.600]   you don't actually have to know the specific protocol.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.760]   I'm not trying to say, do this particular protocol.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.120]   You have to figure out,
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.520]   and it should be easy to figure out
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.180]   what short-term adrenaline increasing behavior
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.920]   you're willing to do on a regular basis every day
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.340]   or two or three times a week.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.400]   Now you could say, well, I'm not sick.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.420]   Should I be doing these things often?
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.560]   I would say two or three times a week at a minimum,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.140]   if your goal is to keep your immune system tuned up
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.420]   and you are in the presence of a lot of children,
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.080]   for instance, which carry a lot of bugs
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.960]   because their immune system isn't developed,
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.160]   or you work in a healthcare setting,
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.720]   or you're simply somebody who's prone to get sick.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.560]   I can just say anecdotally,
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.680]   I guess someone now calls this anecdata,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.040]   which I don't like that phrase
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.080]   because it's sort of, I don't want anecdotal data
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.600]   to ever be misunderstood as anything but anecdotal data.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.980]   Anecdotally, I can say that I've had instances
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.540]   where I've felt a throat tickle coming on
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.020]   or some sinus infection.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.100]   I will do the cyclic breathing that I described before,
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.000]   25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold, 25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.880]   25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold, and then big inhale, hold.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.640]   And most times I didn't get full-blown sick,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.720]   but I also take other precautionary measures
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.960]   to get sleep, et cetera.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.080]   So whether or not it was causal
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.560]   or whether or not it's just correlated, I don't know.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.440]   However, there's a human study
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.780]   that I definitely want to point out to you
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.200]   because it was published more recently
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.160]   than the McEwen work.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.240]   It was published in the "Proceedings
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.400]   of the National Academy of Sciences" for the USA
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.120]   because there are "Proceedings of the National Academy
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.440]   of Sciences" for many other countries as well.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.740]   The title of the paper is "Voluntary Activation
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.240]   of the Sympathetic Nervous System."
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.200]   That's the system that causes fight or flight
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.480]   and AKA stress and causes release of adrenaline
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.640]   and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:48.200]   This is Cox, K-O-X et al, P-N-A-S,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.880]   "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" 2014.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.900]   And they incorporate the ever famous Wim Hof breathing.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.220]   Wim Hof breathing is much like the breathing protocol
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.160]   that I've described several times now in this podcast.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.200]   It's also called Tummo breathing.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.220]   Other people from other cultures and communities
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.280]   have called it other things.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.440]   The naming really isn't important.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.040]   Although I do think Wim is a pioneer
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.780]   in trying to bring these practices
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.560]   to the general public more broadly
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.480]   and was involved in this study.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.520]   The study was done in the Netherlands.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.760]   It was communicated by Dr. Thomas Horvath at Yale.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.200]   I mentioned all that.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.720]   Horvath is a terrific scientist.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.360]   I'm familiar with his work over many years.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   Here's what they did.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   They injected people with E. coli
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.740]   and they had groups that either did the sorts of breathing
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.020]   I've been describing that increase adrenaline release.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.000]   Although I should say,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.540]   I don't think you need that breathing
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.620]   to get adrenaline release.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.940]   You could do it with cold exposure.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.820]   You could do it with other things,
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.780]   high intensity interval training as well.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.780]   And what they found was that the response to the E. coli
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.680]   was quite different in the people that had a protocol,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.580]   in this case breathing, to increase adrenaline.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.540]   So this is a remarkable study
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.040]   because what they found was that the fever, the vomiting,
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.920]   all the negative effects of E. coli,
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.300]   many of them and in some cases all of them
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.620]   were greatly attenuated
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.020]   by way of engaging the adrenaline system,
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.040]   in this case using breathing.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.600]   They looked at inflammatory cytokines,
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.680]   things like IL-6, which I've mentioned many times
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.500]   on this podcast,
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.820]   the sort of classic inflammatory cytokine were reduced.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.460]   Things like IL-10, which are anti-inflammatory,
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.340]   were increased.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.240]   There were some inflammatory cytokines that were increased.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.320]   What's the point here?
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.140]   The point is you can control your immune system
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:49.060]   by finding a way that you can increase adrenaline.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.580]   And this runs counter to what we always hear,
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.740]   which is don't get too stressed or you will get sick.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.540]   Learn to control adrenaline, turn it on and turn it off.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.040]   Learn to control cortisol,
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.760]   turn it on with light in the morning, try and turn it off.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.660]   And then when it spikes because of life events,
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.860]   learn to turn it off.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:12.840]   Learning to turn on and off adrenaline, AKA epinephrine,
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.560]   and learning to turn on and off cortisol
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.160]   affords you the ability to turn on energy and focus
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.300]   in your immune system.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.580]   That's the most important point from today's podcast
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.600]   and understanding that it doesn't matter
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.980]   what protocol you use.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.000]   Maybe it's a cup of coffee and running up a hill
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:31.960]   five or six times.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.640]   That will improve your immune system function
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.220]   if you get adrenaline in your system.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.300]   You can use an ice bath, you can use a cold bath.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.440]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   You can get into an argument,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.840]   but I'm not suggesting you do that.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.480]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.120]   What's important is that you're able to then
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.000]   shut off that response.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.700]   And there are ways to do that we will talk about,
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.640]   but I want to talk about some of the other benefits
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.520]   of epinephrine and cortisol that occur
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.520]   because of their actions on the brain,
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.100]   because these are many and they are powerful
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.560]   and they relate to energy, but also the ability to learn.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.960]   If I haven't already convinced you that seeing light
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.240]   early in the day is good for timing your cortisol,
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.520]   I should also mention that another hormone
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.260]   that I discussed last episode, which is thyroid hormone,
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.560]   and is critical for setting your level of metabolism
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:23.560]   is controlled in part by these circadian mechanisms
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.200]   and cortisol itself.
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.860]   The short takeaway on this is that
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.360]   if you get your cortisol release early in the day,
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.480]   it will increase your energy throughout the day.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.580]   It will also time your thyroid release properly.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.880]   So there's yet another reason why you would want
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.280]   to get that light exposure early in the day.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.980]   For me, that's a non-negotiable practice.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.040]   If I'm on a plane, I'll try and get it any way I can.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.700]   I'm not shining flashlights in my eyes yet,
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.500]   but I really try hard to get that light exposure
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.420]   from sunlight early in the day without fail.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.580]   And the thyroid increase has to do with the fact
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.280]   that your circadian clock itself is regulated by cortisol
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.600]   and the circadian clock times the release
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.920]   of thyroid hormone.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.720]   I don't want to go too far off in that direction,
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.720]   but there are a number of studies,
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:23.240]   Kalsbeek et al, K-A-L-S-B-E-E-K et al,
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.900]   2012, if you want to look it up on PubMed,
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.900]   is a great one that describes how cortisol secretion
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:34.380]   begins to rise during sleep and peaks shortly after waking
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.560]   or immediately before.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   And that times a set of neurons in the circadian clock
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.640]   that then trigger the release of the releasing
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.900]   and stimulating hormones for thyroid.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.740]   So a really important mechanism.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.180]   And thyroid will also tend to correlate with energy,
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.440]   but mostly metabolism.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.420]   Very important to have thyroid in check.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.400]   Now let's talk about epinephrine and cortisol
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.780]   and learning and memory.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.720]   Everyone has a story about being so stressed
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.840]   they couldn't remember something, sit down to an exam.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.220]   I actually had this happen once,
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:12.340]   sat down to an exam and just blanked, just blanked.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.960]   It only happened once, I don't know what happened.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.320]   I don't think it was sleep deprivation,
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.440]   but I just completely blanked.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.920]   And it was very hard for me to pull myself
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.020]   out of that ditch.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.200]   I did manage to do it, but it was a scary experience.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.300]   So I think most people think about stress
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.340]   and an inability to perform.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:33.940]   However, most of the time increases in epinephrine
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.980]   provided they are not through the roof
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.060]   lead to improved performance.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.300]   Now this has been shown over and over again
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:45.560]   on memory tests, on learning new information,
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.580]   on physical performance,
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.320]   that when blood levels of epinephrine are low,
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.920]   you don't perform very well.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.740]   When blood levels of epinephrine are very high,
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.220]   up to about 1,500 to 1,700 picograms per mil,
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.600]   if anyone's out there who's actually measuring this stuff,
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.580]   but I doubt you are, performance goes way up.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.180]   Performance gets better when you are alert
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.080]   and when you're a little bit stressed.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.300]   Absolutely shown again and again and again.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.700]   If you get too stressed, it's the mental side,
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.120]   it's the epinephrine in the brain
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.020]   that causes people to either focus
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.560]   on their somatic response too much,
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.740]   like they feel like they're sweating
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.540]   and they're focused on their bodily response
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.340]   and they're not focused on what it is they're trying to do
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.480]   or say or perform, et cetera, or learn.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:36.140]   But epinephrine is a nootropic.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:39.500]   It is a smart drug that we all make internally
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.060]   and cortisol is as well.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.600]   Now here's the twist.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:49.180]   That does not mean that you want epinephrine high
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.620]   during the exam necessarily.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:58.580]   Memory and learning and performance are actually favored,
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.180]   they are enhanced by epinephrine increases
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.780]   immediately after learning.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.960]   And that's something that's rarely discussed.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.760]   The timing is vital.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.780]   So if you learn some information, you have a conversation,
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:15.060]   you're trying to learn a new language, a new motor skill,
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:18.020]   whatever it is that you're trying to learn,
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:22.500]   the increase in epinephrine that occurs just afterward
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   is what's going to consolidate the information.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.700]   It's going to ensure that the proper circuits
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.940]   and mechanisms in the brain for neuroplasticity
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.460]   are engaged during sleep later that night or the next night,
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.580]   which is when the real rewiring occurs.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.380]   And you might say, that's crazy, why would that happen?
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.940]   Well, we have to remember none of these mechanisms evolved
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.740]   for us to do what we want
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.260]   and learn what we want necessarily,
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.940]   although they will allow us to do that.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:49.140]   We've experienced this before.
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:53.060]   We might have gotten up, gone outside, get in our car,
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.980]   drive to work or to somebody's house.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.500]   You're not thinking about much at all.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.160]   And then all of a sudden you see an accident on the road.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.540]   Your alertness is primed
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.700]   if it happens to be a particularly gory accident,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.080]   there's going to be a lot of sensory information there.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.760]   All of a sudden adrenaline epinephrine
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.180]   is released into your brain and body.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.100]   Guess what?
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.780]   Not only will you not forget that event,
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.620]   but you will remember everything that led up to that event,
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.980]   which has an adaptive function
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.300]   because your brain and body's primary concern is safety.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.300]   This is the neurobiological explanation
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.860]   for Maslow's hierarchy of needs is safety first.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.880]   And so you have heightened awareness and alertness
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.500]   for everything that preceded
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.020]   that spike in adrenaline and cortisol.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.220]   So the way to think about this is
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.140]   if you need to learn something better,
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.100]   if you're taking Adderall or you're taking
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.520]   a lot of coffee beforehand,
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.480]   you're actually driving the process in the wrong direction.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.000]   You're increasing epinephrine for learning, sure,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:54.980]   but past a certain point,
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.860]   you're actually degrading learning and performance.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.500]   The time to do that is toward the end
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.400]   or immediately after the learning,
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.160]   because this mechanism is not simply devoted
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.940]   to negative events like a car crash or a trauma.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.460]   It works to make sure that the hippocampus
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.940]   that encodes memories as part of the memory encoding
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.880]   mechanisms is primed that it's told
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.620]   what you just experienced is important.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.500]   You're going to need that information later.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.200]   And so I've talked many times before
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.820]   about using non-sleep deep rest, NSDR,
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.420]   or ensuring good night's sleep after learning.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.860]   But what we're also talking about is
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.320]   as the learning event tapers off,
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.660]   as you're exiting that to make sure
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.760]   that your epinephrine levels are not tapering off as well.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.180]   And this may be one of the reasons why the 90 minute cycle,
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.580]   the so-called ultradian cycle for learning works
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.540]   because it takes a few minutes
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.420]   to get into rhythm of learning.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.780]   You can maintain that alertness for about 90 minutes.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.980]   It's no coincidence that these podcasts
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.860]   are typically about 90 minutes long.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.380]   And as you exit that 90 minutes,
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.080]   you're going to start to feel fatigued.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.460]   You're not going to be able to continue
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.920]   to secrete epinephrine at the same level.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.200]   So I'm not telling you that at the end of this podcast,
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.060]   you should give yourself a foot shock
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.780]   or that you should jump into an ice bath.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.420]   Although I will say if you were to increase your epinephrine
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.220]   at the end of this episode by breathing
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.020]   or by way of cold shower,
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.140]   I'm willing to bet based on numerous published studies
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.180]   that the memory for the information would be enhanced
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.860]   because of this retroactive effect
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.340]   of epinephrine and cortisol.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.040]   Put simply, you can remember things better
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.020]   if you increase your alertness,
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.940]   AKA your level of epinephrine and cortisol
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.060]   after, immediately after something that you want to learn.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.820]   So I'm reminded by people here at the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.020]   that the optimal strategy therefore
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:55.660]   would be a 90 minute session of focus or learning,
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:00.660]   then immediately after cold shower or tumor type breathing
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.920]   or ice bath or something of that sort,
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.960]   maybe a hard run or hit training
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.120]   if you can't get access to the other things,
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.220]   and then shower up and do a non-sleep deep rest
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.340]   and then get a good night's sleep.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.360]   Those would be the optimal tools
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.700]   and the organization of tools for enhanced learning.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.360]   And of course you could use caffeine
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.640]   to prime the whole process by drinking the caffeine
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.400]   towards the tail of the learning episode,
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.880]   which is counterintuitive at least to me.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.580]   I should mention since many of you use caffeine
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.420]   and I use caffeine, I do drink coffee,
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.540]   I love mushroom coffee, I love mate,
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.740]   I drink caffeine in various forms,
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:41.300]   that there was a study that came out recently
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.300]   that is relevant to our discussion about energy
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.140]   and alertness and learning.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:51.400]   And the study came out just recently in March, 2021,
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   it's Maghalas et al, so M-A-G-A-L-H-A-E-S,
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.420]   and it was published in Molecular Psychiatry,
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.580]   which is a fine journal, a peer-reviewed journal.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.700]   And the title pretty much gives it away.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.120]   Habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.800]   of brain functional connectivity.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.000]   Chronically drinking coffee changes brain connectivity.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.820]   And it does it in a number of ways,
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.380]   but the key takeaways from this study
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.820]   as it relates to sort of what the circuits do
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:25.220]   as opposed to me just listing off a bunch of brain circuits,
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.220]   which is kind of meaningless in this conversation,
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:33.220]   is that people who drank coffee habitually every day
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.340]   had changes in their brain circuitry
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:40.340]   such that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety,
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.680]   even when they don't ingest caffeine.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.800]   So a lot of times we think, oh,
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.340]   caffeine increases your levels of anxiety.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.560]   And indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically,
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.840]   but not just to caffeine.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.100]   It doesn't just raise your baseline of anxiety
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.900]   because of what's circulating in your bloodstream.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.580]   It actually increases connectivity
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.820]   between the brain areas that relate to anxiety.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.380]   Now that could be a good thing or a bad thing,
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.540]   depending on how you look at it.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:10.200]   For people that are prone to chronic panic attacks
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.260]   or anxiety attacks, that's not going to be good.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.860]   Some people might use caffeine in healthy ways.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.180]   I believe I do in order to just increase
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.360]   overall levels of alertness.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.700]   Although now not only am I going to start delaying
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.580]   my caffeine intake till two hours after I wake up
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.180]   for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes,
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.700]   but I'm also going to start drinking it later
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.600]   in learning and focus sessions
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.340]   as a way to enhance plasticity around those learning
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.580]   and focus sessions not before.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.500]   So interesting study, feel free to, it's free online.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.140]   You can access the full paper online.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.940]   We will put a link as well.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.020]   I want to mention this issue of nootropic,
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.060]   so-called smart drugs,
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.340]   which is not a topic that I particularly enjoy
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.460]   because I don't like the name.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.880]   I don't like the idea of a nootropic
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.260]   because what is a smart drug?
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.860]   Well, there's different kinds of smart.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.000]   There's creativity, there's task switching,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.860]   there's strategy building, there's strategy implementation.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.580]   And most of the nootropics that are out there
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.420]   are just cocktails of a bunch of different things
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.540]   that aren't tailored to the individual at all.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.340]   They all seem to have some caffeine
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.620]   or some cholinergic stimulation, et cetera.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.060]   But there's an important way to frame this
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.940]   in light of today's conversation.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.860]   Nootropics generally fall into two categories.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:24.860]   One category are nootropics that increase blood glucose.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.820]   So these are compounds that people take.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.920]   They increase blood glucose,
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.060]   and increasing blood glucose will improve performance
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.620]   and can enhance learning in some situations.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.020]   I'm not suggesting people take these things,
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:38.000]   but here's just a list of a few of those.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.220]   Some of them are legal, some of them are gray market,
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.480]   some of them are illegal.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:48.300]   Paracetams, oxiracetams, the aniracetams, all the tams, okay?
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:52.040]   Elevate blood glucose, that's how they work.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.060]   The neural effects that you hear are secondary or tertiary
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.280]   to the fact that they just increase blood glucose.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.500]   We know that because if you block the blood glucose effect,
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.660]   you block the nootropic effect, okay?
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.660]   Others include, and definitely don't take these please,
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.720]   amphetamine, cocaine.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.380]   Those will increase learning in the short term
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.100]   in particular dosages,
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.020]   but because they increase blood glucose.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.060]   And then of course, things like painful stimuli or stress
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.860]   will improve learning by way of increasing blood glucose.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.420]   Now, stress and epinephrine that's associated with it
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:31.320]   not only improve performance during the learning bout,
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.460]   but as I mentioned before,
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.680]   having epinephrine come up afterward
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.800]   will increase the retention of that information
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.980]   in the long-term.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.760]   And then of course, there's a whole category
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.220]   of nootropics that don't impact blood glucose
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.540]   that work by increasing the cholinergic system activity.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:51.180]   And these are things like choline, lecithin, fazostigmine,
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:55.080]   that's a prescription drug, phosphodiesterine.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.500]   So there are ways to increase energy
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.000]   that don't require increasing blood glucose.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.460]   And this is vitally important.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.820]   The reason we're talking about epinephrine and cortisol
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.160]   for increasing energy and immune system function
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.220]   is because they are largely independent of blood glucose.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.380]   Of course, they interact with that system,
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.020]   but we heard so much growing up, you need to eat for energy,
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.640]   but the energy that we're talking about today
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.140]   is actually a much more powerful one
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.840]   than the one that you derive from food.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.040]   It's, we could call it neural energy.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.040]   It's neurotransmitters that create alertness and focus
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.580]   and the willingness and the ability to move
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:33.140]   and the willingness and ability for immune system
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.560]   to move in response to intruders.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.680]   So I think we all too often think about food as energy,
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.620]   which is great because it is,
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.900]   but there are other sources of energy that are neural
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.860]   and they relate to these hormone systems,
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.020]   cortisol and epinephrine.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.720]   And that's what we're focused on today.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.080]   So up until now, we've been talking about increasing energy
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.060]   and increasing the immune system
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.620]   by way of cortisol and epinephrine,
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.500]   but I'd be totally remiss if I didn't cover
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.360]   how cortisol and epinephrine, if chronically elevated
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.120]   or if elevated too high,
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.620]   can have a lot of detrimental effects.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.580]   These are the things we normally hear about.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.000]   I'm going to describe some of those things,
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.740]   but I'm also going to talk about ways to ameliorate them,
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.700]   ways that you can adjust the cortisol levels
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.700]   even if you're stressed,
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.600]   ways that you can adjust epinephrine levels
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.880]   even if you're stressed
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.280]   so that they have less of a negative impact.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.540]   I don't have to list off all the ways
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.540]   that stress is terrible and chronic stress is terrible.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.300]   I think you know, insomnia,
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.580]   your immune system over time will get battered
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.660]   and you won't be able to fight infection off as well, right?
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.580]   You don't want to be stressed for too long.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:50.920]   You can start laying down the sort of classic pattern
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.800]   of cortisol-induced body fat.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.620]   In fact, there's a whole literature related to comfort foods
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.740]   and why we want to consume comfort foods
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:03.220]   under conditions of chronic stress.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.840]   And it's quite interesting actually
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.800]   because it reveals something
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.540]   about the biology of chronic stress
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.740]   that's informative for how to prevent it
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:15.060]   or to down-regulate chronic stress once it's occurred.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.580]   So let's talk for a second about comfort foods.
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.360]   And the work that I'm going to refer to
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.240]   is work that was done by a very impressive scientist
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.420]   by the name of Mary Dalman.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.800]   Her work goes back decades.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.500]   She was at University of California, San Francisco.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.820]   And she asked this question
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.620]   that on the face of it seems kind of obvious,
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.940]   but for which there was no mechanism known
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.880]   until Mary and her lab personnel came along.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.820]   And the question was, why do we seek high fat
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.760]   and/or high sugar foods when we are stressed for a while?
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.460]   Why would that be?
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:52.400]   And the reason is that the so-called glucocorticoids,
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.480]   of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid,
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.140]   is caused, as we've mentioned before,
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.560]   by releasing hormones from the brain
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.220]   and ACTH from the pituitary, et cetera.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.200]   But normally, high levels of glucocorticoid
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.760]   shut off the releasing hormones in the brain
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.520]   and in the pituitary.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.700]   They shut down in a so-called negative feedback loop.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:17.700]   So just like if testosterone or estrogen get too high,
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:22.040]   that's read out, or that is seen, so to speak,
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.960]   by neurons in the pituitary and brain,
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.620]   and then we shut down our production
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:31.380]   of estrogen and testosterone.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.980]   If cortisol levels get too high,
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.380]   if there's too much cortisol floating around
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.740]   in our bloodstream, there's a negative feedback loop,
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.660]   and the brain and pituitary shut down CRH and ACTH,
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.700]   which would otherwise stimulate more cortisol.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.480]   So cortisol levels go down.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.340]   So it's a beautiful negative feedback loop.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.060]   Chronic stress, however,
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:53.100]   stress that lasts more than four to seven days,
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.680]   and there's a way to think about
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.680]   what chronic stress really is in an actionable way,
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.240]   causes changes in the feedback loop
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.240]   between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.620]   Such that now the brain and the pituitary
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.340]   respond to high levels of glucocorticoids, cortisol,
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.740]   by releasing more of them.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.180]   It becomes a positive feedback loop, and that's bad.
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.780]   It actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.620]   and transcription and translation,
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.780]   and so you really don't want chronic stress
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.620]   because it's a cascade of stress equals more stress
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.460]   equals more stress.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.700]   So this is why it's very important
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:32.500]   to learn to turn off the stress response.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.900]   You don't want it elevated for too long.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.500]   So there's one study that Dalman and her colleagues did
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.320]   where they stimulate chronic stress
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.000]   by increasing corticosteron, cortisol,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.900]   and they found that subjects
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:48.780]   would increase their consumption of sugar and fat.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.460]   In fact, they would even eat lard.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.560]   It would just, it sounds disgusting,
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.420]   but they were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar,
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.300]   and that led to all sorts of things like type 2 diabetes,
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:03.420]   that led to dysfunction in the adrenal output, et cetera.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.420]   And so the real key is to learn
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.580]   to shut off the stress response
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.100]   because the interesting thing is is that Dalman and colleagues
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.380]   and some studies that followed up on their work
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:17.380]   found that if the system was kicked into motion for too long,
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:22.200]   then there was a tremendous shift overall towards anxiety
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.460]   because it turns out that body fat itself
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.140]   receives neural innervation.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.420]   It received, neurons actually talk to body fat.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:32.160]   So now you have body fat releasing certain hormones.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.140]   You've got the adrenals releasing cortisol,
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.080]   and all of that is feeding back to the brain
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.180]   to make you want more sugar and fatty foods.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.220]   So that's how the so-called comfort foods work.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.820]   And you should watch yourself
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.420]   next time you experience stress.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.020]   If it's a short-term bout of stress,
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.820]   typically it blocks hunger.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.780]   If it's a longer bout of stress,
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.440]   typically it triggers hunger,
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.060]   in particular for these so-called comfort foods,
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.700]   sugary and fatty foods.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.860]   And it's kind of interesting how short-term stress
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.460]   can actually block hunger.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:07.760]   It does that by activating or interacting
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.960]   with a system called the bombicin system.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.040]   Bombicin is a peptide hormone.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.140]   It was actually, I think it was named
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.880]   after some sort of reptile or amphibian, excuse me,
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.120]   some sort of toad.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.020]   I think it was initially sequenced from the toad
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.860]   before it was later discovered in humans.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.300]   And I think the toad's Latin name is Bombina bombina
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.380]   or something of that sort.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.840]   And so they decided to call this thing bombicin,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.420]   but it reduces eating and stress liberates bombicin
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.740]   and makes you want to eat less.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.980]   But chronic stress causes all these positive feedback
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:43.800]   changes, which are not positive.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.860]   They're positive, I'm calling them positive
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.500]   because they amplify the stress response over and over,
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.400]   not because they are good for you.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.340]   So short-term stress, great.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.660]   Long-term stress, really, really bad.
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.340]   Other bad effects of stress that we can talk about,
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.940]   and I won't list off too many more of these
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:03.020]   because you know so many of them, you hear about them,
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.260]   you really want to know how to control them, I'm guessing,
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.520]   is that yes, indeed, stress can make you go gray.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.540]   The rates at which people go gray, meaning gray hair,
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.320]   some cases gray body hair as well,
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.500]   depend on some genetic factors.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:22.260]   There are a couple of ways that we can go gray.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.380]   There's actually a stem cell,
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.180]   what they call niche in every follicle.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.500]   So you have stem cells in the follicle
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.020]   that can produce more and more of the given hair cell.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.100]   And they're actually peroxide groups.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.900]   You know, we hear about bleaching hair with peroxide,
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.440]   at least in the '80s, that was a thing,
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.780]   but you can use hydrogen peroxide to bleach things,
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.820]   and you can produce your own peroxide in the hair follicle
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.980]   that will cause the hairs to go gray.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.840]   In addition, pigmentation of hair,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.300]   just like pigmentation of skin,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.580]   is controlled by melanocytes.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.960]   Our old friends, the melanocytes.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.860]   And I say old friends because on previous episodes,
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:58.020]   I talked about why sunlight and getting ample sunlight
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.500]   can increase levels of certain things
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.220]   like melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which reduce hunger,
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:07.100]   it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels,
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.560]   and all the reasons for that.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.740]   Well, it turns out that activation
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.940]   of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.500]   which is really just another name for the system
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.880]   that liberates adrenaline from the adrenals
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.100]   and epinephrine in the brain,
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.780]   drives depletion of melanocytes in hair stem cells.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.620]   So indeed, there's a rate of aging
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.900]   that we will undergo based on our genetics,
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.100]   but stress will make us go gray.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.980]   And the paper that you should look to
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.220]   if you want to read more about this came out very recently.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:42.060]   This is Zang et al., Z-H-A-N-G, et al., "Nature,"
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:46.300]   fabulous journal, definitely one of the apex journals, 2020.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   So this paper showed that the activation of stress
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.620]   in various forms will deplete these melanocyte stem cells.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.460]   You do not have to worry about an ice bath
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.000]   or hard exercise or breathing,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.460]   increasing your levels of stress
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.900]   to the point where it's going to make you go gray.
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.820]   We're talking again about chronic stress.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:08.520]   And if you want to offset the stress effects
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:13.100]   on graying of hair, you can do that
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.880]   by either having a practice that helps you regulate stress
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.980]   on a consistent basis,
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:21.140]   so something like non-sleep deep breaths or meditation.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.700]   If you can get access to massages or vacations,
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.780]   those are great, but having a practice
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:29.060]   to keep stress clamped so that it's not chronically elevated,
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.000]   that will be great.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.020]   As well, this is another case where sunlight,
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.740]   we know, stimulates melanocytes,
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.100]   not just in skin, but in hair.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.900]   And so getting ample sunlight,
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.260]   having a practice to regulate stress
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:48.060]   will offset the stress-induced graying of hairs
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:53.060]   by way of stress-induced depletion of melanocytes.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.700]   And if melanocyte sounds a lot like melanin, you're right.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.640]   That's because anything involved with pigmentation
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.300]   in the brain and body generally has melano
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.920]   in the front of the word in some way or another.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.640]   So if chronic stress is so bad
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:09.300]   because of its effects on epinephrine and cortisol
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.780]   being elevated for too long,
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.800]   then the question becomes, of course,
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.940]   well, what's chronic stress?
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:18.880]   How do I know the difference between chronic and acute stress
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.440]   and how do I keep chronic stress at bay
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.740]   because of all these negative effects?
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.760]   And I didn't even list out the number of other ones,
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.800]   the effects on depression,
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.180]   which certainly has a correlate with elevated cortisol.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:36.420]   Thyroid hormone associated with low thyroid hormone
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:40.220]   is associated with depression, mistimed thyroid.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:45.220]   Once again, getting your light and your feeding
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:50.220]   and your exercise and your sleep on a consistent schedule
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:53.520]   or consistent-ish is going to be the most powerful thing
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.860]   you can do in order to buffer yourself
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.780]   against negative effects on mental health
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.200]   and physical health for that matter.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.900]   There are things that one can take,
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.300]   supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.820]   Some of you out there may have or may know people
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.180]   that have Cushing's, which is chronically elevated cortisol.
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.300]   There are prescription drugs that we will talk about
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.980]   that can be used.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   But most people are dealing with a situation
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.040]   where life gets stressful, then less stressful,
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.300]   stressful, then less stressful.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:26.380]   I would say based on the data from McEwen and others,
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.800]   Bob Sapolsky's lab over many years,
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.140]   I would say any stress that lasts more than a day
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.420]   or two days or three days
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.200]   is starting to become chronic stress.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.640]   There's really no strict cutoff
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.740]   because we're not measuring everybody's cortisol
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:41.580]   from moment to moment.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:42.960]   My lab has done experiments
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.040]   where we measure stress in people over time.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.060]   People vary tremendously in their ability
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.500]   to have a really hard day and then fall deeply asleep.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500]   That's going to be the ultimate reset
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.540]   is the ability to sleep well,
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.120]   more or less undisturbed each night,
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.960]   although one or two wake-ups during the night
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.980]   probably not going to be too detrimental
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.620]   provided they're not too long
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.160]   and you're not viewing light
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.260]   during those wake-ups or your phone.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.020]   But the things that you can take
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.680]   if you feel like you're chronically stressed
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.800]   and you're veering toward
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.380]   some of the negative effects of stress are many.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:16.520]   There are some simple things that people can do
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.660]   in terms of supplementation.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.060]   All supplements, of course,
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.960]   have to be checked out for their safety margins for you
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.640]   because it's going to differ from person to person.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.320]   You're responsible for making sure they're safe for you
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.680]   if you decide to use them.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.500]   One of the most common ones is ashwagandha
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:37.100]   and it has a powerful anxiolytic anxiety effect.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.740]   You're welcome to go to examine.com and for zero cost,
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.880]   you can see their so-called human effect matrix.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.100]   Ashwagandha has many uses.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:50.860]   It's been used to enhance power output in athletes.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:54.700]   It has been shown to modestly increase testosterone.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.940]   It has been shown to modestly adjust things
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.060]   like low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:01.820]   the so-called bad cholesterol in quotes.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.820]   It has a profound effect on anxiety.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.440]   That's been shown in nine studies,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.260]   nine peer-reviewed independent studies,
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:11.460]   I mean, funded by organizations that have no vested interest
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.980]   in the answer.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:17.080]   It has a very strong effect on cortisol itself.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:17.940]   How strong?
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:22.940]   The decrease in cortisol noted in humans is 14.5 to 27.9%
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:27.780]   reduction in otherwise healthy but stressed humans.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.560]   That's great, six studies.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.460]   So that's, and it mentions this is significantly larger
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.780]   than many other supplements.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.060]   Now, some people will say that taking ashwagandha
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.300]   chronically may not be good.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.540]   If you've heard about that,
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.460]   or you can point to specific studies
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:46.180]   that indicate exactly why it's not good,
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:49.240]   please put it in the comment section or let me know.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.220]   In the comment section on YouTube would be best.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:56.640]   The studies that I'm referring to did explore both genders.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.460]   The number of subjects was reasonably high, 64 or more.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.380]   One to six months studies,
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.140]   so these were long-term studies, that's great.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.020]   You'd like to see that, not just an acute study.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.940]   So males and females, lots of different ages,
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.540]   a weight, excuse me, overweight and non-overweight.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.140]   They did blood draws of cortisol,
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.220]   which is going to end as well as saliva tests.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.380]   Saliva is actually the best way to measure free cortisol.
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:23.300]   You can also measure it from earwax, it turns out,
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.540]   which sounds pretty gross and kind of is,
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.300]   but nonetheless, that's where cortisol will accumulate
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:32.980]   in earwax and in saliva, the free cortisol.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:36.580]   But that's six very quality studies,
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.060]   independently supported,
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:42.100]   that all point to these very significant,
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.840]   14.5 to 27.9% reductions in otherwise healthy adults.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.020]   So if you're somebody who is dealing with chronic stress,
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.700]   it's a stressful period in your life,
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:53.580]   and you want to stave off the negative effects of stress,
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:56.060]   well then, ashwagandha may,
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.700]   I want to highlight may be right for you.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.180]   It also does tend to lower total cortisol,
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.240]   which is interesting.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.500]   Can lower depression to a somewhat minimal degree.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.220]   And can lower, as I mentioned before,
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.420]   things like low-density lipoprotein.
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.340]   So that, I think ashwagandha comes through
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:17.380]   as kind of the heavy hitter in this department.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.860]   Now, what's interesting also is the other effects
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.060]   of ashwagandha that are downstream
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.900]   of reducing chronic stress and cortisol,
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.340]   'cause cortisol has so many effects.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:28.460]   They're receptors for cortisol all over the body and brain.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.480]   And so I'll just list these off quickly.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.980]   I'm not going to list off each study
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.820]   or talk about how many subjects in detail.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.020]   Again, you can go to examine.com if you want
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.500]   and just put in ashwagandha.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.140]   C-reactive protein, which is a marker
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:45.040]   of all sorts of negative health effects.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.900]   Cardiovascular health, even macular degeneration
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.700]   is notably reduced.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.140]   Heart palpitations, notably reduced.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:55.380]   Serum T3 and T4, our old friends for the thyroid hormones
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.360]   from a previous episode are increased.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.800]   Symptoms of OCD decreased,
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.500]   both the obsessions and the compulsions, right?
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:06.800]   Obsessions are of the mind, compulsions are of behavior.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.900]   So there are a lot of things that are downstream
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.540]   of reducing cortisol.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:16.180]   Lowered heart rate, lowered rates of insomnia,
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.120]   slightly improved memory.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.420]   Why that would be, I don't know,
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.700]   because cortisol in the short term can increase memory.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.940]   I'm guessing it's from increased sleep.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.140]   Decreased pain, increased quality,
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:29.060]   decreased reaction times, things of that sort.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.540]   So the list goes on and on.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.620]   But all of those things stem downstream of decreased cortisol
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.200]   So if one were to decide to take ashwagandha
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.180]   in order to reduce cortisol,
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.260]   given that you want cortisol early in the day
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.380]   to have energy throughout the day,
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:45.660]   the time to take it is probably later in the day
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.980]   or in the evening.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.900]   I've never heard of it preventing sleep
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.180]   or causing insomnia of any kind.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.920]   That certainly wasn't listed as one of the major effects
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.540]   on examine.com.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.420]   I will take ashwagandha from time to time
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:00.360]   if I'm chronically stressed or if I'm not sleeping as well
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.200]   as I ought to.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.140]   You might think that with all my knowledge about sleep
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.300]   and sleep protocols that I would sleep perfectly every night
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:09.420]   but unfortunately I have a dog that has a canine form
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.180]   of sundowners, of dementia.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.500]   So he's up much of the night these days.
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.660]   And so there's no way I'm getting a solid night
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:17.140]   of sleep lately.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.340]   And so I will supplement with ashwagandha
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.980]   and typically I'll take it before sleep
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.620]   and maybe also with my last meal of the day
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.700]   which is at least two hours before I go to sleep.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.320]   Again, you have to decide if it's right for you.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.940]   The dosages can vary tremendously.
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.540]   I would just go by what's on the bottle
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:35.660]   from a reputable brand.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.620]   I would also check out examine.com
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:40.300]   because it mentions a range of dosages
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.180]   that people have used
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.980]   and in various studies to different effects.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:46.060]   Now, there is something out there that some of you
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.680]   may actually be taking or ingesting
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.180]   that can increase cortisol and not so incidentally
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:53.980]   can decrease estrogen and testosterone.
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.360]   Because remember cortisol is made
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.780]   from the cholesterol molecule.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:00.260]   So is estrogen and testosterone.
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:02.900]   So are estrogen and testosterone, excuse me.
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:05.560]   And it's competitive.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.400]   So you're either making more cortisol
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.160]   or you're making more of the sex steroid hormones,
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.700]   estrogen and testosterone.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.540]   Believe it or not licorice,
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.200]   which I always thought of as a candy,
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:21.000]   but licorice contains a substance that I can't pronounce.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   G-L-Y-C-Y-R-R-H-I-Z-I-N glycericizin,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.600]   which is of the glabrous species of plant.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.640]   Actually, because of its chemistry,
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:39.200]   this 18 beta hydroxyceridic acid,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.960]   you don't need to know all that licorice, black licorice,
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   contains a substance that increases cortisol.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.020]   And its increase is not huge, but is significant.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.720]   This has been looked at in females age 18 to 29,
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:58.880]   males and females age 18 to 29, people age 30.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   These are separate studies
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.280]   where I'm listing off the different ages, ages 30 to 64.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.680]   Turns out that you can see pretty substantial increases
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.680]   in serum cortisol and decreases in testosterone and estrogen.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.460]   So that was complete news to me.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.120]   Also increases in blood pressure
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.400]   that are pretty substantial,
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.780]   that's going to be downstream of cortisol.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.780]   Increasing cortisol is increased blood pressure
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.360]   in order to engage the stress response
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.880]   that's part of this stress response.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:28.640]   Increased hormones of other kinds
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.760]   that are associated with stress.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.740]   So who knew?
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:33.040]   I didn't know, maybe you knew previously,
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:33.880]   if you did forgive me,
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.260]   but licorice and some of the compounds in black licorice
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.600]   can actually increase stress,
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.120]   probably not the thing to be ingesting
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.320]   during periods of chronic stress.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.820]   Whether or not anyone has had positive effects
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:47.580]   of using it to increase cortisol in other contexts,
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.500]   let me know.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.600]   But very interesting that the chemistry of licorice
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.760]   increases stress hormones
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.220]   and therefore you would probably want to,
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:58.380]   almost certainly we want to avoid it
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.500]   in conditions of chronic stress.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.840]   Also, if you're trying to optimize testosterone and estrogen,
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.240]   licorice seems like a bad idea.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.780]   I suppose one instance where you might want to use licorice
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.920]   would be if you're traveling
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.420]   and you're trying to wake up at a particular location,
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.720]   because licorice has these effects on cortisol
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.480]   and cortisol is associated with the waking phenomenon
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.080]   and alertness and energy,
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.680]   you could use it in that regard.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.520]   However, I would be careful to time it
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.600]   so that you're not getting two cortisol increases
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.360]   throughout the day, two peaks.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.840]   So you're going to want to make sure
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.280]   that you're doing all the other things correct for jet lag
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.760]   and adjusting to jet lag.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.720]   And if you want to know what those things are,
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.380]   including timing your feeding, using temperature,
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.840]   using exercise, using light to adjust to jet lag
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.360]   more quickly, please see the episode that we did
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.980]   on jet lag and shift work,
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.340]   where I cover all those protocols in detail.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.200]   The other compound that I think deserves attention
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:57.000]   is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.260]   which is what's found in chamomile.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:03.720]   Apigenin I've talked about previously,
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.140]   it has various effects.
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.540]   One is it is a mild anti-estrogen
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.240]   that's been shown in various studies,
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.780]   and it does have a bit of an anxiolytic effect
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.300]   of reducing anxiety.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.120]   I take it before bedtime, 50 milligrams.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.200]   Again, you have to decide or figure out
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.340]   if that's safe for you or not.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.160]   I'm not suggesting you take it.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.400]   The major source of action is to calm the nervous system,
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.340]   and it does that primarily by adjusting things
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.680]   like GABA and chloride channels,
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.700]   but also has a mild effect in reducing cortisol.
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.360]   So Ashwagandha and apigenin together
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.380]   sort of I would consider the most potent
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:42.700]   commercial compounds that are in supplement
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:45.900]   non-prescription form that one could use
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.340]   if they were interested in reducing chronic stress,
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.580]   especially late in the day by way of reducing cortisol
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.860]   late in the day.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.240]   So you're probably getting the impression
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.660]   that cortisol and epinephrine
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.180]   are a bit of a double-edged sword.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.220]   You want them elevated, but not for too long or too much.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:03.820]   You don't want them up for days and days and days,
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.940]   but you do want to have a practice
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.900]   in order to increase them in the short term.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:12.580]   So we should talk about protocols
[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:17.580]   that can set a foundation of cortisol and epinephrine
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.680]   that is headed towards optimal.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.080]   Optimization is always going to be a series
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.080]   of regular practices that you do every day.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.760]   So sleeping at certain times, light at specific times,
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.780]   food at specific times, certain foods, et cetera.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.080]   And that's highly individual, but there are some universals.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:34.680]   And we've covered a number of those in the discussion today.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.980]   Meal timing, meal schedules has a profound effect
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:40.920]   on energy levels.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.080]   And as I mentioned before,
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.740]   the energy I'm referring to is not glucose energy.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.600]   It's not burning carbs while running or ketones.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.360]   What I'm talking about is neural energy,
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.920]   epinephrine and cortisol.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:55.900]   Fasting and timing one's eating
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.840]   are two sides of the same coin.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.880]   So even if you're on a kind of standard three meal a day
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.500]   with a couple of snacks in between diet
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.540]   or nutrition regimen, you are fasting
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.980]   whenever you're asleep or you're not ingesting any calories.
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.160]   So unless you're hooked up to an IV of glucose,
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.080]   you are fasting while you're sleeping.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.060]   There are several different kinds of fasting
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.260]   that can relate to epinephrine and cortisol.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:20.100]   I will do an entire episode on optimizing food intake
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.580]   for performance in the sports context.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.660]   That's coming up.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:28.640]   But in the meantime, I'd like to just talk about fasting
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:31.960]   as a source of epinephrine.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.980]   Anytime when our blood glucose is low,
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.220]   cortisol and epinephrine are going to go up.
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:39.700]   If we fast for too long, that is stress.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:40.620]   There's no way around that.
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:41.460]   Now that doesn't mean
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:44.560]   it doesn't have other beneficial effects.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.340]   Running a marathon is stress,
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.800]   but it can also have positive effects if that's your thing.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.840]   So stress has been demonized as a term,
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:55.720]   but we want to think about stress mechanistically
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.360]   as epinephrine and cortisol.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.800]   And then if we do that,
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.420]   we can think about how to regulate its timing.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:05.040]   So anytime we have an eaten for four to six hours,
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:06.420]   levels of epinephrine and cortisol
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.480]   are going to go up pretty substantially.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.680]   There's an exception to that,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.560]   which is if you are used to eating on the clock
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.640]   every two hours or every hour,
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:17.560]   being half hour late or being even 10 minutes late
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.180]   on that schedule will induce stress.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.700]   Most of that psychological stress,
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.320]   but also the release of things like ghrelin
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.240]   that are going to make you hungry
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.340]   'cause they're on that eating clock.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:30.100]   So one thing that many people do to great benefit
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.480]   is they follow a so-called circadian eating schedule.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.640]   They eat only when the sun is up,
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.460]   they stop when the sun is down, more or less.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.480]   The other way to think about this
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.680]   is they stop eating a couple hours before sleep
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.420]   and they eat more or less upon waking,
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.720]   assuming that they're waking up more or less
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.720]   around the time that the sun rises,
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.440]   maybe plus or minus two hours.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.800]   Okay, so sort of typical schedule.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.700]   Now let's say you decide to do what I do,
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:56.920]   which is I skip breakfast.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.680]   I drink water, I delay my caffeine
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.460]   for 90 minutes to two hours, and then I drink my caffeine.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.080]   And then my first meal is typically around lunchtime,
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.200]   11, 30 or 12.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:08.360]   And yes, occasionally I throw back some almonds or walnuts
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.920]   or something earlier in the day.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:14.520]   But I do do that from time to time if I get hungry enough
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.860]   or if I just happen to see them.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.300]   I'm kind of a drive-by eater.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.080]   If I see blueberries or nuts or something,
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.040]   I just kind of pick them up and put them in my mouth.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.360]   I try and not do that off other people's plates,
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.320]   but I just have that habit of doing that from time to time.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.160]   But typically I don't eat until about noon.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.880]   So I've got a cortisol increase.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.160]   I've got my sunlight in the morning.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.960]   So I'm getting a big pulse in energy early in the day.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.400]   And yes, there's a little bit of agitation.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.360]   I am hungry sometimes early in the day, sometimes no.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.640]   But my ghrelin system is used to
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.020]   kicking in right around noon.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.440]   At the point where I eat,
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.140]   as long as I don't eat carbohydrate, in my case,
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.600]   I know that my epinephrine levels
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.760]   are going to stay pretty high.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.220]   So for me, it's usually meat and salad
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.680]   or something of that sort or fish and salad.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.900]   I don't particularly like eating fish because of the taste,
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:03.760]   but I'm essentially low carb or keto-ish throughout the day.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.320]   So I'm probably in a slightly elevated state
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.480]   of epinephrine and cortisol throughout the day.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.020]   Some of you are fasting even longer.
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.120]   You're pushing out till 4 p.m. or 8 p.m.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.500]   or maybe you're even fasting around the clock.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.860]   Anytime you're fasting,
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:19.880]   you're increasing epinephrine and cortisol release.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.700]   You can do all the meditation in the world
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.180]   to keep your mind calm,
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:26.440]   but you are closer to that edge of stress.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.500]   And you're closer to that edge of peak stress.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:32.440]   So that's something that's just important to understand.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.600]   The description about comfort foods and cortisol
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.020]   was one of kind of an extreme case
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:40.120]   where cortisol systems kick over to a positive feedback loop,
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.160]   but we all eat to suppress cortisol and epinephrine.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.040]   When we're hungry, cortisol and epinephrine
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.320]   create an agitation so we go seek food.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.440]   When we ingest food,
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.000]   typically if it includes carbohydrate,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.320]   there's a blunting of cortisol,
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.240]   there's a blunting of epinephrine in the bloodstream.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.280]   If you've ever had too much coffee to drink
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.400]   and you go and have a couple of pieces of bread,
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.320]   you will feel that you might describe it
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.480]   as the caffeine getting soaked up out of your system,
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.700]   but what you're doing is you're elevating blood glucose,
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.280]   which is more or less saturating
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.820]   the effect of caffeine in your system.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.520]   Not completely, but it's going to have that effect.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.440]   If you're very stressed and you sit down to eat something,
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.020]   it will calm you down.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:20.040]   Yes, because some of the blood that goes to your stomach,
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.440]   but more so because of these effects
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.280]   in blunting cortisol and epinephrine.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.200]   So the important point here is that if you want to be alert,
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.200]   you can do that by way of not eating.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.880]   Of course, please ingest fluids.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.760]   I know some people water fast out there.
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.360]   I am yet to see good science on water fasting
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.060]   and why that can stimulate stem cells.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.900]   Or people love the idea of after the Nobel Prize
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.880]   was given for autophagy and this idea
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.320]   that our cells clean up debris and senescent cells.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.420]   Yes, that's true.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:49.680]   But the idea that water fasting is going to promote that,
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.820]   I find rather amusing.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.080]   Please send me the data if you know some great study
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.960]   in a decent journal,
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.280]   but pretty much this is something I hear about.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.660]   I don't think water fasting is a good idea,
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.900]   nor should you be drinking so much water
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.740]   that you kill yourself.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.900]   You can actually drink enough water that you die.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.480]   So I think ingesting water in healthy amounts
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.920]   is a good thing, stay hydrated.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.080]   But if you want to be alert, stay hydrated.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.280]   Caffeine may or may not be in your regimen,
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.720]   but fasting will make sure that your levels of energy
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.800]   are up and you will be primed very well
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.440]   for doing a protocol of the sort that we talked about
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.360]   earlier in this episode of breathing or cold exposure
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.460]   or exercise to get that increase
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.060]   in the immune system function.
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:32.900]   And if you do that after learning,
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.440]   after trying to learn something,
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.660]   it will increase learning
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:38.480]   for that particular set of information,
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.900]   whether or not it's motor or language
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:43.440]   or whatever it happens to be, mathematics, programming.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.740]   So fasting is a tool for many reasons,
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.700]   can increase growth hormone, et cetera.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:52.520]   But today I'm talking about fasting as a tool
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.920]   to bias your system toward more epinephrine
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.560]   adrenaline release and toward more cortisol release,
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:01.880]   but still low enough that it's not chronic stress,
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.160]   that it's not causing negative health effects.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.320]   But please know that if life is very, very stressful,
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.980]   if you're experiencing lots of stressors
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:13.480]   and you're chronically fasting,
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.240]   you are positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.800]   of being chronically stressed in the ways that are negative.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.520]   Negative effects on the reproductive axis,
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.880]   lower testosterone and estrogen,
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.400]   negative effects on your hair will turn gray.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.600]   There's reasons for that.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.840]   Your sleep will suffer, your immune system will suffer.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.840]   So I think while it's nuanced,
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:39.820]   our discussion today about epinephrine and cortisol,
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.440]   increasing energy and immunity
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.560]   are designed to help you understand
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.220]   when you should be doing certain things,
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:49.680]   when you should throttle back,
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.160]   when you might want to kick up your adrenaline a bit.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.320]   If you're suffering from low energy
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.580]   because you're just kind of feeling down
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.880]   and a little bit under-activated,
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.840]   well, then the practices of ice baths
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.520]   and intense breathing, et cetera,
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:05.900]   could be very beneficial, so might fasting.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.020]   But if you're feeling exhausted and burnt out,
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:11.960]   so drained and stressed,
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.160]   well, then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.880]   or doing a lot of intense exercise
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:20.940]   is driving you further and further into chronic stress.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:24.860]   So because I don't have a saliva test or a blood test
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.520]   or God forbid an earwax test to measure your cortisol
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.080]   as we're engaging in this discussion together,
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.440]   you have to gauge for yourself
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.740]   whether or not you are in a state of under-activated
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:38.940]   and need more epinephrine and cortisol,
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:43.600]   or whether or not you are over-activated
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.120]   in terms of cortisol and epinephrine,
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.320]   and you need ways to buffer those, ashwagandha.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.080]   Maybe it should be a warm mellow bath, not an ice bath.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.920]   So one has to learn how to regulate these hormones
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.960]   with behavior, with nutrition, perhaps with supplementation.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.740]   And then of course there are prescription drugs.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.100]   And I always leave these to the end
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.840]   because A, I'm not a medical doctor,
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.760]   I'm not prescribing anything, I'm a professor,
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.800]   I'm professing a number of things that you can decide
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.500]   for yourselves what to do with or not.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.820]   But of course there are prescription drugs
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:15.120]   that can increase cortisol or decrease cortisol
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.700]   in cases like Cushing syndrome,
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.980]   which if you have that diagnosed,
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.660]   you should talk to a physician.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:23.580]   You should talk ideally to a endocrinologist,
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:26.780]   but to a physician of some sort, board certified physician.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:31.780]   There are drugs that can be used to treat injury
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.700]   like corticosterones that you can inject
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.660]   to reduce inflammation and injury, but they are cortisol.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.600]   So they're going to bias you towards more stress
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.440]   in other domains.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.920]   Remember cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.440]   so you're going to be more prone to psychological stress.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.760]   I also want to mention again
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.040]   that I think there's great benefit to having a practice
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.960]   that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't,
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.000]   maybe every third day or every other day
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.280]   of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.500]   while learning to stay calm in the mind
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.460]   so that you learn to separate the brain-body experience.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:04.100]   We hear so much about how beneficial it is
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.660]   to unify the brain and body
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.580]   that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:11.660]   I particularly dislike claims like that
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:14.960]   or statements like that because there's great power
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:18.500]   as we learned today in having your body activated
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:21.060]   by some sort of stimulus, cold water
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.780]   or even psychological stress,
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.980]   but learning to stay calm in your mind.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.580]   I should just remind you that most of the negative effects
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.760]   on your life and on the lives of others are due to people,
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.860]   perhaps you, I hope not, being unable to regulate their mind
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:39.000]   when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body,
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.600]   either 'cause they read something in a text
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.200]   or a comment section.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.020]   Of course, that never happens to me,
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.760]   but it may happen to you, of course it happens to me,
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.920]   but the idea is to stay calm in your mind
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.460]   so that then you can regulate your action, right?
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:55.100]   And so I think that there are these practices
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.360]   that one can develop over time
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.220]   that are really straightforward and zero cost, right?
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:03.320]   You could find any number of ways
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.080]   to increase your adrenaline and stay calm.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.020]   And we tend to focus on things like exercise
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.740]   as the way that we get our energy up.
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.060]   But today, again, I'm talking about
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.160]   deliberately increasing adrenaline
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.380]   while staying calm mentally,
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.920]   because that has great utility
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.880]   when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events,
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.960]   through things that we didn't seek out.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.000]   So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.600]   is about inducing them deliberately
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:35.240]   when you want to push back on infection,
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.860]   potential infection from bacteria or viruses.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:40.800]   It's about pulling back on adrenaline and cortisol
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.400]   maybe through the use of supplementation,
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.700]   but certainly through proper use of light and sleep
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:48.160]   and mental tools that we talked about as well.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.840]   When they are chronically elevated.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.720]   It's about training your system,
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.900]   not just to be unified at brain and body,
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.080]   which sounds great until you're stressed
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.240]   and then that's terrible.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:01.360]   It's really about having a deliberate dissociation
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.880]   between the adrenaline response from the adrenals
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.600]   and the adrenaline response from the brainstem.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.320]   So once again, we've covered a ton of material.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.660]   I hope right now you're thinking,
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.260]   okay, am I in a state of chronic stress?
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.400]   Am I underactivated?
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.080]   Or could I afford to increase my levels
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.720]   of adrenaline and cortisol to improve my relationship
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:26.080]   to my immune system and to energy, neural energy?
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.400]   If you like the information that you heard today
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.760]   and you want to remember it,
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.520]   well then at the end of this episode,
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.600]   perhaps you go do something
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.880]   to increase your level of adrenaline.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.200]   And now you know what some of those things are
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.020]   because it will help you retain the information.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.440]   Or you could apply that to anything else
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.020]   that you learn or experience, of course.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:47.460]   And I hope that you'll think about some of the ways
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:51.820]   in which cortisol and adrenaline are not good or bad,
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:53.020]   that stress isn't good or bad,
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.900]   but short-term stress is healthy.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.320]   Alertness and energy is healthy,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.780]   even if it puts you at the edge of agitation.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.340]   That's an opportunity to learn
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.300]   how to control these hormones better.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.460]   And I hope that if you're in a state of chronic stress,
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:07.040]   that you'll do things to start tamping down
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.860]   some of that stress and that you realize
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:13.040]   that your nervous system and your hormone system are linked,
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.900]   but they're linked in ways that you can control,
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.120]   that we don't have to be slaves to our hormones,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.380]   and certainly not the hormones that cause us stress.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.780]   We can learn to control those
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:24.260]   both to the benefit of our body and benefit of mind.
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.900]   If you're learning from this podcast

[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.500]   We do read all the comments,
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:10.760]   and I know many of you are anxiously awaiting
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.000]   particular topics and episodes,
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.800]   and we will eventually get to them all.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.360]   I'm not going anywhere.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.140]   And we do want to be thorough about every topic.
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:22.880]   Today, we rounded out the discussion about hormones.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.040]   We aren't going to continue with that topic any longer.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.180]   We are moving to a new topic segment
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:29.320]   for an entire month or so.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.520]   If you know of other people that you think could benefit
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.420]   from the information on this podcast
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:35.660]   or that you think would enjoy listening to it,
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.240]   please forward it along to them.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.000]   We'd really appreciate that.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.040]   Another great way to support us is to check out our sponsors
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.760]   that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.360]   We also have a Patreon.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.340]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:50.900]   There, you can support the podcast
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:53.000]   at any level that you like.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.320]   I should mention that I will be answering some questions
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:59.760]   that come up frequently in the comment section on YouTube
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.280]   in Instagram Lives every once in a while.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.320]   I am on Twitter @hubermanlab.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.840]   I'm on Instagram also @hubermanlab.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:09.680]   And on Instagram from time to time coming up,
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.580]   I'm going to be discussing answers to your common questions
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.960]   in these Instagram Lives,
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.960]   and I will make sure that they're recorded.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.160]   So you can check those out.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.700]   Please follow our Instagram if you are not already doing
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.560]   that and check out our Twitter if you're on Twitter.
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.520]   I covered a lot of different types of tools today,
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:28.860]   behavioral tools, et cetera, but I did mention supplements.
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:30.960]   For those of you that are interested in supplements,
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.440]   we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.720]   because we believe them to have the highest levels
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:40.360]   of stringency and quality in terms of supplement production,
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.900]   in terms of amounts of supplements
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.900]   in their different formulations, et cetera.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:47.660]   If you want to check out the supplements that I take
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:50.160]   and you want to get a discount on Thorne supplements,
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:55.160]   you can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman,
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:00.220]   and you can get 20% off any of the supplements that I take
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:03.800]   or any of the supplements that Thorne sells for that matter.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.200]   That's Thorne.com/u/huberman
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.920]   to get 20% off anything that Thorne makes.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.280]   Thank you for joining me
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:13.960]   for what I hope was an informative discussion
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.440]   and an actionable discussion about how to increase energy
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.200]   and the immune system by way of cortisol
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.600]   and adrenaline epinephrine.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.920]   I really appreciate your willingness to learn new topics
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.240]   as well as to embrace and think about new tools
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.120]   and whether or not they're right for you.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.020]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.180]   (upbeat music)
