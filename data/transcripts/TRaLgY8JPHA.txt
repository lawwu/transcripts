[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Here, I think, in this incident in the life of Isaac that is recorded here, we find something
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:18.060]   that is of very great value to us. The picture you see is one of Isaac in trouble, in a difficulty.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.520]   If you read the context, you will find that he had been living in another part of the
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.960]   country and God had blessed him in a very striking manner, so much so that Isaac had
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.800]   become the object of envy of those who were living around and about him. And they had
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.120]   forced him to move. Abimelech said unto Isaac, "Go from us, for thou art much mightier than
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.160]   we." And so Isaac is compelled to move with his family and all his servants and possessions
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.880]   and belongings. And he came to this valley of Gera and decided that he would dwell there.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.440]   Well, of course, the moment he arrived, he was confronted by a very urgent and very desperate
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.240]   need, and that was the need of water. Now, I do want to emphasize that because the need,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.920]   in other words, was the need of something that is absolutely essential to life in addition
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   to being essential to well-being. He wasn't merely confronted by the problem of seeking
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.960]   some beauty spot where he might pitch his tent or erect some kind of dwelling place
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.880]   for himself. He wasn't looking for entertainment. He wasn't looking for luxuries. He wasn't
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.480]   looking for any kind of accessories to life. The whole point of the story is that he was
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.680]   looking for something which is an absolute essential and without which life cannot be
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   maintained at all. Now, I'm emphasizing that for this reason, that as I was indicating
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.200]   last Sunday morning, the first thing we have to realize about the present position is its
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:22.080]   desperate character, is the urgency of the situation. In other words, the trouble, as
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.480]   I see it with the Church today, is that she doesn't realize that she should, that her
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.840]   primary need and her urgent need at the moment is the need of life itself. The problem confronting
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.000]   us is not a problem of methods or of organization or of making a slight adjustment here or there
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.200]   or improving things a little bit or keeping them up to date or anything like that. It
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.440]   seems to me that the whole position is one in which we are well-earned down to this basic
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.120]   issue. That, as I was trying to indicate last Sunday, is certainly the position as regards
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.840]   the world. The problem of society today is not a superficial problem. It is a very radical
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.600]   one. The whole outlook upon life is involved, and serious observers, as you know, are indeed
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:27.160]   appalled as they contemplate what is really taking place. I was reading a letter by a
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   well-known medical authority only this very week, even yesterday, in which he said that
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.840]   he'd been charged with being behind the times and old-fashioned and almost with saying that
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.960]   he wished that he were dead as he contemplated certain things that are taking place. And
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.240]   he admitted, quite frankly, that there was a great deal of truth in that. So appalled
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:03.920]   is the man at the whole trend of life and of living that he is even capable of expressing
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.840]   himself in such sentiments. Well, now I say that is the situation, and it is the situation
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.520]   confronting the Church. There is no doubt that we've been living on the capital of the
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.080]   past. And as you go around this country and look at the congregations, you'll see that
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.680]   very quickly and very soon you can carry on for a certain length of time on tradition
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.320]   and by custom and habit. But a point is bound to come when you've ceased to have any capital
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.840]   left, and then you realize that you're facing something absolutely ultimate, something which
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.040]   is fundamental. And that, as I say, is the whole situation today of the Christian Church.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:56.800]   We rarely are in the position of this man Isaac. And the problem confronting us is the
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:07.360]   need of life itself, the need of that fundamental power and vigor in every activity of the Church
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.600]   which rarely can make an impact upon the world and do something vital and drastic with regard
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.640]   to the whole trend of affairs at the present time. So I say we must realize that it is
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:31.400]   this primitive need, if you like, the need of water, the need of life, the need of power,
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.880]   the need of the Spirit himself. There are times in the Church when what is needed is
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.160]   some sort of minor adjustment here or there. But that's not the trouble today. It isn't
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.480]   minor matters. It isn't third-rate and fourth-rate matters that are in the balance at the moment.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.320]   It is the whole life of the Church. It is the whole question of a spiritual outlook
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.640]   upon life as over and against everything that is represented by the world. Very well, there
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   is the need.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:14.480]   Now, the great lesson here taught us is this. What did Isaac do face to face with this particular
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:24.600]   need? Now, here is our message. And you notice, first of all, what he didn't do. It's so
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   significant. It's so important for us. Here he is. He's been driven out. He's been caused
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.280]   to move. He's got a family. He's got possessions. He's got servants. He's got animals. And if
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.640]   they don't find water soon, well, life itself will come to an end. They'll perish.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.120]   Well now then, face to face with this urgent need, what does he do? Well, you notice that
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:57.120]   he doesn't send for the prospectors. He doesn't send for the water diviners. He doesn't send
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:07.960]   for these men who are experts in seeking and discovering fresh suppliers of water. No,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.280]   the whole message is that Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.760]   the days of Abraham his father.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:26.320]   Now, here again is a message surely that is sorely needed, because the whole outlook seems
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:33.600]   to be the very reverse of that of Isaac, as one looks at it in the church in general.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.360]   The kind of thing you read constantly in the books and the religious journals is this.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.600]   What we need, they say, is a message for this atomic age, or a message for this second Elizabethan
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:54.080]   period. And therefore, we must all be setting out in a quest for truth, a search for the
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:02.520]   message that is needed. So we call in the prospectors. We look to the scientists. We
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.400]   look to philosophy. Then psychology has got its contribution to make. We call for the
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.560]   latest knowledge and learning. We want the very last advance in science and in culture
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.000]   in every shape and form.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.440]   And the whole idea is that, admittedly, the world is in a very serious predicament, and
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.640]   therefore it behoves all men of understanding to come together and pool their resources,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.560]   call a congress of world faiths, bring in everybody who believes in religion anyhow
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.520]   and worships any sort of God. Let us try and get together to see if we cannot arrive at
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.760]   the principle and the truth that is needed.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.560]   And so, at the present time, the thing that is most obvious about the life of the church
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:56.200]   in general is the multiplicity of conferences. And there they are trying to find the formula,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:03.280]   trying to discover some word, trying to discover some message. It is this atomic age, you see,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.240]   we are in this, and we must have a message for this atomic age, and so on. The twentieth
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:16.480]   century, that is the whole emphasis. And instead of doing what Isaac did, we are calling in
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.720]   the prospectors and the water diviners, trying to see if we can discover a source of supply
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.400]   of water somewhere that will enable us to continue.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:37.640]   Now, the emphasis is, I say, that Isaac did nothing of the kind. But what he did was this.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:45.440]   Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham, his
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:53.080]   father. Why did he do this? Well, I think the wisdom of this is perfectly clear and
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:02.960]   quite obvious. Isaac realized that his situation was such that it was no time for experimentation.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.160]   The position, I say, was so urgent that if they did not have water and that very quickly,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:14.000]   they would all perish. And how does he argue in such a position? Well, he argues like this.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.360]   He says there is no need for us to prospect and send for the water diviners. My father
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.840]   Abraham was once in this area. And if there was one thing that characterized Abraham above
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.680]   everything else, it was that he was an expert on this very question of finding water and
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.960]   sinking wells. Now, you read the story of Abraham in the earlier chapters of Genesis,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:46.720]   and you will find exactly what I mean by that statement. Isaac knew that Abraham had found
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.600]   water. Wherever he went, he always succeeded. And he dug his wells, and he had an abundant
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.800]   supply. So Isaac argues like this. He says my immediate business is to make certain that
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:06.440]   we've got a supply. Then, having got a supply and being sure of a supply, if we like, we
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:12.040]   can prospect. We may try to seek for a further supply. We can try our experiments. But a
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:19.640]   man who experiments in the midst of a crisis is a fool. The first thing to do is to make
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:27.800]   certain that you have a guaranteed supply, that you have that vital source which will
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.920]   enable you to live and to continue, and then perhaps allow you to do these various other
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:40.520]   things. That, it seems to me, was clearly the reasoning of Isaac. He says, "Ah, my
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.840]   father was here. Now then, where did he sink these wells?" You can go there with certainty
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.400]   and with assurance and confidence, for you'll find water there. My father knew what he was
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.320]   doing, and his whole life proves that he was a success in this matter. So back he went
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:03.520]   to the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:13.840]   Well now then, this brings us, of course, inevitably to our theme these Sunday mornings.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.520]   If you like it as a principle, what I'm saying is that there is great value in the
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:28.880]   reading of church history and the study of the past, and that surely nothing is more
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.920]   important for us at this present time than to read the history of the past and to discover
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:44.280]   its lesson. And I suggest we should do that for the very reasons which impelled Isaac
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.600]   to dig again the wells which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:59.760]   Now there is nothing that I know of that is quite so foolish as to ignore the past. And
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:08.200]   a man who does ignore the past and assumes that our problems are quite new, and that
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:14.760]   therefore the past has nothing at all to teach us, is a man who is not only grossly ignorant
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:24.880]   of the scriptures, but he is equally ignorant of the greatest lessons even of secular history.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.680]   But I think you will agree that that is the mentality that is governing the outlook of
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:41.640]   the vast majority at the present time. You see, the basic assumption is that our problems
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:49.840]   are new, that they are quite unique, and that the church and the world have never been confronted
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.720]   by such problems before.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.960]   Now there is one very interesting thing about this year, 1959. It is, as I've been saying,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.360]   the centenary of that mighty outpouring of the Spirit of God that was experienced in
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:10.040]   the United States and in Northern Ireland and Wales and Scotland and even parts of England
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:19.840]   in 1859. But it is also the centenary of something else, and that is the publication of that
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:27.000]   famous book by Charles Darwin called The Origin of Species. And there is no doubt at all that
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.360]   it is Darwin's book that is governing the outlook of the vast majority today, not only
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.000]   in the world but alas, in the church.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.200]   And the Darwinian philosophy, of course, in its essence is just this, is this question
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.020]   of evolution. And it is said to affect the whole of life. Darwin himself wasn't much
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:56.480]   concerned about that, but his co-adjutors, people like Huxley and still more perhaps
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.640]   the philosopher Spencer, they took hold of this principle and they said this is working
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.280]   in the whole of life, this progress, this development, this advancement. Everything
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.560]   is going upwards, moving forwards, and therefore at any given point you are of necessity in
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.440]   a superior position to that which went before.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:24.480]   Now the church has taken hold of this idea, and therefore she tends to argue that our
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.000]   position in mid-twentieth century is essentially different from the position that has ever
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.200]   been known before. And therefore we must ignore the past. We can forget it. It cannot possibly
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.360]   help us. It wasn't confronted by our problems and difficulties. It hadn't our knowledge,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.200]   and so on and so forth.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:51.680]   So the whole outlook and mentality today is one which is opposed to going back to digging
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.600]   again the wells which they had digged in the days of Abram, his father. No, no, they say,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:04.240]   the position is quite new. Now this is of all the fallacies the most fatal, and for
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:19.160]   these reasons. God is still the same. There is no difference in God as between today and
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:26.560]   a hundred years ago. Indeed, God is the same today as he was a thousand years ago, and
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:39.200]   two thousand years ago, and way back six thousand years ago, in the time of Abram. God is from
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:49.880]   everlasting to everlasting. He doesn't change at all. But not only is that true, it is equally
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:57.680]   true to say that man is still the same. You see, if it could be established that God is
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.000]   somehow different and that man is somehow different, I'd be ready to listen to this
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.440]   argument that assumes that our problems are unique and that therefore we mustn't look
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:17.040]   back. But man is still precisely the same as he always has been. It is to me almost
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:24.600]   incredible and incomprehensible that anybody who has ever read the Bible at all, or indeed
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:31.680]   even human history, could possibly dispute this, even for a second, what superficial
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.440]   thinkers we are. We are assuming that because man can ride in an aeroplane and split the
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.520]   atom that he is somehow different from his forefathers who couldn't do that. But that
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:53.120]   isn't man. Man himself you discover by looking into how he thinks, what he really is interested
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:18:00.040]   in, and how he reacts. And what is man interested in today? Well, man today is primarily and
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:09.200]   fundamentally interested in the very things that they were interested in 4000 years ago
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.280]   in the time of Abraham. You see, you just read your newspapers and you see that the
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:24.160]   major interests of man still are eating, drinking, making war, sex, pleasure of various types.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   They are all here in the Old Testament and man is still doing the same things. Look at
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:37.040]   the major social problems confronting us today. And you will find all of them in the Bible.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:47.600]   Theft, robbery, violence, jealousy, envy, infidelity, divorce, separation, all these
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.840]   things, perversions, every one of them is in the Bible. These are the problems of man
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.240]   today as they've always been. It's not a new problem. Abraham had the problem of finding
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:07.960]   water. Isaac has precisely the same problem. And the problems of man and of living in society
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:16.680]   have not changed at all in spite of the passage of all the years. All the differences are
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:24.320]   on the surface, they are irrelevant, and they are immaterial. God remains the same, man
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:30.920]   remains the same. Yes, and the New Testament reminds us that the solution to the problem
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:41.560]   remains the same. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. So that there is nothing,
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:49.400]   it seems to me, that is quite so hopeless as this tacit assumption of the modern man
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:56.880]   in his overweening conceit and pride that he is something different and that his problems
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.840]   are quite new and entirely and essentially different from those confronting all his forefathers.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:10.640]   No, no, listen to the wisdom of Isaac. See the urgency of the position and remember that
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.160]   Abraham was a man who knew what he was doing. The history of the past has a great deal to
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.880]   tell us. Well, what does it tell us? Well, here are two of the main things that it does
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.480]   tell us. You look back across the history of the Christian church and this is what you'll
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:37.880]   find immediately. That the story of the church has not been a straight line, a level record
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:45.560]   of achievement. It hasn't been that at all. The history of the church has been a history
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:54.280]   of ups and downs and ups and downs. It's there on the very surface. You go back into
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.680]   the history of the past and you'll find that there have been periods in the history
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:09.400]   of the church when she has been full of life and vigor and power. The very statistics prove
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:16.280]   that people crowded to the house of God. The attendance upon public worship manifested
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:22.080]   it. The whole numbers of people who were anxious and eager to belong to the Christian church,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   there it is. The church was filled with life and she had great power. The gospel was preached
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.960]   with authority. Large numbers of people were converted regularly, day by day and week by
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.800]   week. Christian people delighted in prayer. You didn't have to whip them up to prayer
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.680]   meetings. You couldn't keep them from them. They didn't want to go home. They'd stay
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:52.320]   all night praying. The whole church was alive and full of power and of vigor and of might.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:58.560]   And men and women were able to tell of rich experiences of the grace of God, visitations
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:04.000]   of his spirit, and knowledge of the love of God that thrilled them and moved them and
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.520]   made them feel that it was more precious than the whole world. And as a consequence of all
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:19.840]   that, the whole life of the country affected and changed.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.120]   Now I could give you endless examples of this, but let me take one only which is the most
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:33.320]   notable of all, and that is perhaps the evangelical awakening of 200 years ago. That is what happened
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:41.600]   then. And that is why your best secular historians are ready to admit and to agree that it was
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.760]   that evangelical awakening in the time of Whitefield and the Westlers that probably
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:53.240]   saved this country from an experience such as they had in France in the French Revolution.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.400]   Now that's the opinion of secular historians. You see, the church was so filled with life
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:05.000]   and with power that the whole of society was affected. And the influence of that evangelical
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.120]   awakening upon the life of the last century is again something that is admitted freely
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:18.040]   by all who are aware of the facts. And indeed, the same thing happened a hundred years ago
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.400]   in the revival to which I have been referring. And so it has happened in every revival.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.880]   Well now then, that is what you find when you go back. The church hasn't always been
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:36.080]   as she is now. You've seen these tremendous periods of life and vigor and of power. Ah
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:43.160]   yes, but what you notice also is this. And this is where it is so encouraging to go back
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:51.360]   into history. These glorious periods of revival and of reawakening have often followed periods
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:24:02.480]   of great drought, great deadness, apathy, and lifelessness in the history of the church.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:10.160]   Every one of them. As you find these great peaks, you will find the troughs. You will
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.560]   see that the church has many a time been as she is today, counting so little in the life
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:22.360]   of the world and of society. So lacking in life and vigor and power and witness and all
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.560]   that accompanies it. You will find that that has happened many and many a time before.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.800]   That there has been this desperate, urgent need even as it confronts us today. And then
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:42.200]   after that has come this mighty uplift. This outpouring of the Spirit of God. Now there
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.800]   is one good reason therefore for going back into the history of the past. And not just
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.120]   looking at our own problems and saying, "Ah now then, what can we do about improving the
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.800]   technique, improving our methods in this respect or that respect?" That's what's being done,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.560]   isn't it? Exploring the problem, trying to amend a little bit here and make a little
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.840]   adjustment there, trying to bring up to date our machinery. No, no, that isn't the problem.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:14.200]   We must go back and learn that this is the lesson of history. These awful troughs and
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.880]   the only way in which the church can be lifted out of them.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:29.080]   And my second principle is this one. Any reading of church history, even that which is cursory
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:39.800]   and superficial, will I think bring out this principle abundantly clearly. That every time
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:49.200]   you do get one of these great and glorious and mighty periods, you will find that in
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:58.080]   every instance it seems to be a returning to something that it obtained before. Indeed
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.480]   I'll go further. You will find that every one of them seems to be a returning to what
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:13.960]   you can read and find in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Every time when the church
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.280]   is thus revived, she seems to be doing what Isaac did. She's going back to something that
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.560]   had happened before and rediscovering it and there finding the ancient supply.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   Now there is nothing I know of that is more striking in the history of the church than
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.160]   just that principle. I can put it to you like this. Read the story of the great revivals
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:47.960]   with which God has visited the church throughout the centuries and you will find that it always
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:55.840]   seems to be almost precisely the same thing. Try it another way. Having tried it like this
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:05.280]   historically, try it geographically. Read the stories of revivals in England, Great
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:18.080]   Britain, America, Africa, China, Korea, Manchuria, India, it doesn't matter where you go. Any
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.360]   part of the world you may like to choose. It doesn't matter where you are nor when you
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:33.440]   are there. You will find that every time what has happened and what is happening seems to
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:43.280]   be an exact repetition of what has always happened at such times and on such occasions.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:49.520]   Now this is surely something that we cannot afford to ignore. In our desperate need at
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:57.480]   the present time, in this urgent need of life and power, this water without which we can
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:04.240]   achieve nothing and cannot even exist. Here is a great record and testimony that comes
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:13.280]   to us from the past. God has dealt with such occasions in ages past and He is still the
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:23.120]   same. There is a supply available if only we go to it and go for it. That is the message.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:30.240]   Well now then that brings me to my next principle which is this. Isaac in his wisdom decides
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:38.640]   to go back. He is going to make certain of a supply. So he commands his men to go to
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:45.800]   those old wells which have been digged by Abraham his father. And back they go. So my
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:52.560]   next principle is this, what Isaac found. What did Isaac and his men find when they
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:59.600]   went back to the old wells? Well they found this, that the Philistines had stopped them
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:06.240]   after the death of Abraham. You are told exactly the same thing in the 15th verse. "For all
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.600]   the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:18.840]   the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth." So that when they went
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:28.080]   back to these old wells that is what they found. In other words we can put it like this.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:34.160]   They went back to the old wells yes and the water is still there in the old wells but
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:41.640]   they couldn't see it. And the water wasn't available. The water is there yes but they
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:50.320]   can't see any sign of it. And they can't obtain it. They can't use it. Now here is
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.160]   a wonderful picture isn't it? There down in the depths is that old pristine supply
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.560]   of water. And here are men in a desperate need. They say now the water is there. But
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.280]   the problem is how can we get hold of it and what's happened here? What's gone wrong?
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:13.880]   Why aren't we seeing water? Why can't we put in our vessels and draw water? The answer
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:20.800]   is that the Philistines had stopped the wells. They had filled them up with earth and with
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:27.200]   rubbish and refuse. So that though the water is there it isn't available and it isn't
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:36.200]   visible. If there is one thing I want to stress and to impress more than anything else, it
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:45.240]   is this principle. My dear friends, there is only one explanation of the state of the
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:54.880]   Christian church today. It is the work of the Philistines. The water is there. Well
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.480]   why don't we see it? Why are we not able to drink of it? The Philistines have been
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   here and they filled the wells with the earth and the rubbish and the refuse. And that is
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:17.360]   the immediate matter confronting us. Now the one thing that tempts me at times to be impatient
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:26.040]   is just this, that the church doesn't seem to see this, doesn't seem to realize it, and
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.520]   isn't ready to face it. And what makes me more impatient than all is that so many evangelical
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.320]   people are not ready to face this. I'm not a controversialist as a man. I like to preach
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.480]   a positive gospel. We must be kind and loving. We mustn't be critical in these times. The
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:46.160]   problem is so urgent we must all stand together. If a man calls himself a Christian, let's
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:51.040]   all get under the same umbrella. Now I say that as long as you indulge in that thinking
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:58.440]   and that kind of mentality, the problem will go from bad to worse. The cause of the problem
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:06.480]   is the work of the Philistines, and it's nothing but that. Let me emphasize this therefore
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:15.880]   by putting it like this. The troubles confronting the church today, the problem confronting
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:26.800]   her, is not the new circumstances in which we find ourselves. You see, that's what we're
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:35.040]   always being told, isn't it? Until we're all, I hope, sick and tired of it. The wireless,
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.160]   the television, the motor car, and all the things that are being offered to the modern
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.960]   man. There, we are told, is the problem. The church has never had such a battle to fight
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:51.080]   in her life. All these things that draw people away, there's the problem of the church.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:58.160]   And we are such experts on these things, aren't we? And they're all completely irrelevant.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:08.000]   Every one of them, and I'll tell you why. In different forms, those things have always
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.240]   been there. Always. Now that is where you see it's so important to read history. Before
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.400]   that evangelical awakening of two hundred years ago, the churches were as empty as they
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   are today, perhaps even more so. And they couldn't get the people to come to listen
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   to the preaching of the gospel. Why? Well, they were interested in other things. "But
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.480]   you said they hadn't got televisions." I know. But you know, they greatly enjoyed cockfighting.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:45.280]   They greatly enjoyed card playing. They greatly enjoyed gambling. They greatly enjoyed drinking.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.440]   The world has never been at a loss to find an excuse not to go to church and to listen
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:56.320]   to the preaching of the gospel. The thinking of today is so monstrously superficial. Because
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:02.120]   there's a change in the form of the pleasure, we think that the whole situation is new,
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.640]   and we talk about this problem of the twentieth century, and all the things that are against
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.120]   us. Hell and the devil have always been against the church. The world has always hated the
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   message and has never been short of an excuse to avoid it. There is nothing in that argument
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:25.880]   at all. "Ah, but wait a minute," says somebody. "What about the new knowledge?"
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:32.600]   Perhaps you're right in what you say about the sins of two hundred years ago and four
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.680]   thousand years ago. But, my dear sir, what about the new knowledge? Here's our problem.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:45.520]   Here is this peculiar something that applies only to the twentieth century. You know, an
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:52.320]   act was passed in 1870 giving popular education. And if you ignore that, well, you're going
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.080]   to fly in the face of facts. Everybody's educated now, and everybody's got learning.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:01.240]   And you see, they're listening to these great men lecturing about science and about the
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:07.800]   atom. Men are so sophisticated. There's tremendous advance in knowledge all along
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.000]   the line. And are you asking us to believe that the problem and the position are still
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:22.040]   exactly the same? Well, I am, and for this good reason. That all this agreed tremendous
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:30.840]   advance in scientific knowledge has nothing whatsoever to do with this problem. Nothing
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   whatsoever. If you could show me how this new knowledge in any way makes a difference
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:46.800]   to God, I'd be ready to listen to you. But it doesn't. He's the God who made the atom.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.120]   Man's only just beginning to discover what God did and what God has done and what God
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.920]   is still doing. So you see, it makes no difference to God at all. "Oh, I'll take all this
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.600]   knowledge. I don't care what department. I'm issuing this as an open challenge, and
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.560]   I'm prepared to defend my position wherever you like and whenever you like." Where is
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:16.640]   any glimpse or glimmer of modern knowledge that in any way touches or affects this problem
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:23.560]   of God and man, man's soul in its relationship to God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who he is
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:30.120]   and what he has done? What has any of this knowledge to do with that? It has none at
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:37.600]   all. But on top of that, I can remind you of this. You see, we talk about our modern
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:44.120]   knowledge as if it had changed the whole situation. You go back and read the history of the Church
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:53.360]   250 years ago and what you find. Well, then that was the period of what was called deism,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:37:00.160]   the period before the great evangelical awakening of that time. And then, you see, as I have
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.080]   reminded you, people didn't go to places of worship. Why? Well, it was because of their
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:10.640]   knowledge. They said exactly the same thing. There had been a great scientific awakening
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.800]   in the middle of the 17th century. Isaac Newton and others had lived. Harvey discovered the
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.320]   circulation of the blood. The Royal Society had been founded, you remember, in the early
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:26.480]   days of Charles II. There was a great awakening of scientific knowledge and the whole world
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.800]   had become scientific and rationalistic. You read the story of the fight the Church had
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:39.680]   with the rationalism of the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century, and
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.000]   you will find that people then were saying exactly what they are saying now. It was this
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.960]   new knowledge, this new understanding, all that physics and astronomy and all these things
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.760]   had brought into being. There, they said, was the problem. The fact of the matter is
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.480]   that the Church has always had to meet that self-same argument, and it is as irrelevant
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:09.960]   and as futile today as it has always been in the previous centuries.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.600]   Then let me mention one other thing. I am just dealing with the arguments that are being
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.120]   brought forward by the Church. These are our problems, our peculiar circumstances, this
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:27.760]   new knowledge. And then, the divided Church. All this, we are told, is the thing. Of course,
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.400]   they say, you are perfectly right when you are emphasizing that the position is desperate
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.040]   and that unless something happens soon, indeed, the whole future of the Church is involved.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.040]   But they say, what is the cause of it? Oh, there is only one explanation, the divided
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:49.120]   Church. So the thing that is being emphasized above everything else is the need for Church
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:56.360]   unity. We must all come together. We must all be one in a great organization. Then we
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.320]   will be able to confront the divided Church. They say you will never get blessing while
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.400]   the Church is divided. You cannot evangelize while the Church is divided. Those are their
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:13.160]   statements. What is the answer? Well, it is all in Church history. You see, they do not
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.800]   read it. And if they read it, they forget it. They are so blinded by the prejudice that
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:31.160]   they deny blatant facts. What are the facts? They are these. That in the past, even when
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:41.360]   the Church has been acutely divided, more so than she is today, God has sent revival.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:48.520]   Great blessing has been experienced. There were endless divisions in the Church a hundred
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:56.960]   years ago in America and in Northern Ireland. They were divided up into the same denominations
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:04.720]   as today, and even more so. Yet though that was the fact, God sent his blessing and poured
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.560]   out his Spirit. It is a lie to say that the division of the Church is the one cause of
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:20.040]   a lack of blessing. It is not that. Because the history shows this very plainly, that
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:27.320]   God sends this blessing even when the Church is divided, and that the coming of the revival
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:37.400]   has two main effects. One, that it blesses all the denominations practically, irrespective
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   of their divisions, and for the time being brings them together in a marvelous unity.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   There has never been anything that has so promoted spiritual unity as revival. But a
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:02.600]   revival also invariably has another effect, and that is that it creates a new and a fresh
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:11.360]   division. Division! And why does he do so? He does so for this reason. Those who have
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.360]   experienced the blessing and the power of God are naturally one, and they come together.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.120]   There are others who dislike it all, and who criticize it all, and who condemn it all,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.400]   and who are outside it all, and the division comes in. John Wesley never wanted to leave
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:33.320]   the Church of England, but Methodism had to come out, was driven out. The division was
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   caused by the revival. It has happened every time. The Protestant Reformation. Luther did
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.840]   not set out to divide the Church of Rome, but the blessing of the revival divided the
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   Church of Rome into Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. You always get this, "This
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.360]   is pure history." And yet we are told, "You see, the one obstacle is the divided
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:58.400]   Church. It is just unutterable rubbish. It is the rubbish of the Philistines." This
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.520]   is the thing that is standing between us, amongst others, and the water and the supply
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:15.000]   that we are so sorely in need of. So I say that we must dismiss all these things and
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:22.760]   realize that these are not the hindrances, these are not the problem. The problem, in
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:33.240]   other words, as Isaac found, is that this nefarious work of the Philistines has been
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:45.120]   blocking the wells, concealing the water, standing between the people and the blessings
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.120]   of God.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:53.280]   Very well, I am afraid I have to leave it at that this morning. But obviously and clearly
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:00.160]   we have to go on to consider what this work of the Philistines is. We have to be honest,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:09.240]   we have to be blunt, we have to be plain and clear. We have to have the courage of conviction.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.760]   We need the witness and the testimony of the Spirit as we do, so let us pray for it, that
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:22.680]   God will give us honest minds to face the facts as they are, that we may see the real
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:30.200]   cause of trouble, so that having seen it, we shall be able again to emulate the example
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:40.360]   of Isaac and clear out the rubbish of the Philistines and come again across the ancient
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:50.160]   supply of the water of God, the power of the Spirit, and enter with all God's people
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:44:01.120]   into a period of unusual blessing and a mighty outpouring of His Holy Spirit. May God enable
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.120]   us to do so.
