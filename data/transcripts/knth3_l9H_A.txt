[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.980]   - Pastor John, in episode 101, we looked at Jeremiah 29 11,
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.680]   which is a very popular verse for a lot of Christians.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.940]   And one listener asks if the promised blessings to Israel
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.760]   can rightly be applied to the Christian life,
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.280]   and if so, how?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.340]   As a follow up question to that episode,
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.860]   how do the blessings promised to the psalmist
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.460]   apply to us today, or do they at all?
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.060]   - This morning, Tony, I was reading in Psalm 18.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.140]   In fact, I read the whole Psalm, it's a long Psalm,
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.140]   50 verses, and the question that rose is,
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.540]   what does this have to do with me?
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.580]   Because this is really, really about David.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.380]   This Psalm 18 has, I think,
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.460]   the longest introduction of any Psalm.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.420]   It goes like this, "To the choir master,
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.680]   a Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.460]   who addressed the words of this Psalm to the Lord
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.320]   on the day when the Lord rescued him
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.740]   from the hand of all his enemies
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.860]   and from the hand of Saul, he said,"
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.980]   now that's a long introduction.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.780]   So we know this is really about David,
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.860]   it's about his situation, and when you read it,
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.740]   it's just full of God's salvation for David
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.980]   from his enemies, and then it ends that way.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.100]   "Great salvation he brings to his king
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.740]   and shows steadfast love to his anointed,
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.240]   to David and his offspring forever."
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   So I got finished reading it, and I was happy for David,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.000]   and I know that Jesus is the true David,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.320]   the final David, and the final king,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.920]   and therefore I'm celebrating the triumphs
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.240]   of Messiah as well, but I wondered,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.440]   can I take these verses?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440]   I mean, here they are, I mean, things like,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.500]   "He's my strength, he's my rock, he's my fortress,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.180]   my deliverer, my shield, he saves me from my enemies,
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660]   he brings me out into a broad place,
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.100]   he rescues me and he delights in me,
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   and he's a light and my lamp, and he lights my darkness,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.220]   I can run against a troop, I can leap over a wall,
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.360]   your right hand supports me, you delivered me
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940]   from the strife of the peoples."
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.940]   So when I read that, can I say, "Yes, God does that
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.760]   for John Piper because it says so here,"
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.120]   or do I have to say, "Well, yeah, it says so here,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.440]   but really I have to go over and find some nice text
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.920]   in Matthew to find God's care for me."
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.420]   And here's the thing I'd love to share,
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.200]   'cause God just did it for me this morning
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.240]   in a very precious way, when it says at the end,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.420]   "Great salvation he brings to his king
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.180]   and shows steadfast love," and that's what I want every day,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.900]   I want God to love me in a steadfast moment-by-moment way,
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.500]   and I wanna be assured of that from the Bible
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   in a warranted true way, I don't wanna just make it up,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.180]   and he says he does that to David and his offspring.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.860]   And when I read offspring, I thought,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.860]   okay, is that just Christ, is that just the line of kings
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.640]   who have a right to the throne,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   or is more going on there for me than I might think?
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.320]   And the Lord brought back to my mind,
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.960]   'cause I worked on this years ago in a pretty concerted way
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.820]   when I preached on Isaiah 55, goodness,
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.480]   must have been 10 or 15 years ago, I don't know,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.820]   the first verses of Isaiah 55,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.420]   and a lot of people know these verses,
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.620]   they're really precious,
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.000]   "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.740]   So now, when I read that, I think, everyone who thirsts?
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.980]   Okay, I'm there, and I'm thirsty, so this is about me,
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.900]   he who has no money, that's me, come buy and eat,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.420]   come buy wine and milk without money, without price,
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.780]   so this is incredibly broad, you don't have to be a Jew,
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.960]   you don't have to be smart, all you have to be
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.760]   is hungry for me, come to me,
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.700]   why do you spend your money for that which is not bread
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.140]   and your labor for what doesn't satisfy?
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.740]   Listen to me, incline your ear to me, come to me,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.300]   and here's the promise,
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.260]   I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.300]   my steadfast, sure love for David.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.760]   I thought, okay, I think what you're promising me there
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   is that if I'm just a hungry, thirsty, bankrupt,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.840]   needy person willing to turn to God,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.080]   he will make a covenant with me,
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   and the covenant is his love for David,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.320]   which is absolutely stunning promise,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.640]   because what it says is, all the promises I make to David,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.080]   all that verse 50 of Psalm 18,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.240]   the steadfast, sure love that I have for David
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   and to his offspring is yours, because you've come to me,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   I've grafted you into that,
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.640]   and then you can go over to the New Testament,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.140]   where all that's worked out for us and how that works,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.920]   but the truth of it was really there in Isaiah 55, 3
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.040]   and Psalm 18, 50, and in the New Testament,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.320]   if we endure with him, we will reign with him,
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   we will sit on his throne, Revelation 3, 21,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.960]   and so you start to feel the incredible implications
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   of being the offspring of David
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.240]   and having the covenant with David made to us.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.080]   So what God did for me this morning
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.560]   in regard to Psalm 18, Tony, was really quite precious,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   and I would just commend the Psalms to all of our listeners
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.120]   that they might enjoy the way they really are meant
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.480]   to be taken for God's people.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
