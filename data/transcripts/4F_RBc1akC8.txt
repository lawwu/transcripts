[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.520]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.800]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.400]   Today marks the third episode
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.000]   in our six-episode series all about sleep
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.320]   with expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.920]   During today's episode, we discuss
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.680]   how to structure your sleep for optimal mental health,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.400]   physical health, and performance.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.520]   We discuss monophasic sleep schedules,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.240]   which are the more typical sleep schedule
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.480]   where you go to sleep at night
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.640]   and then wake up in the morning,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.160]   so sleeping in one bout,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.720]   as opposed to polyphasic sleep schedules,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.880]   which are when you sleep in two or more bouts,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.720]   either at night or perhaps a shorter bout of sleep at night
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.800]   and another bout of sleep during the day.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.120]   We also discuss naps, including how to nap,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.400]   how long your nap should be,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.600]   whether or not naps are good or bad,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.720]   in particular, whether or not they're good or bad for you.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.080]   It turns out this varies according to individual.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.800]   We also discuss how your needs for sleep and naps
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.720]   vary across the lifespan.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.080]   And we discuss body position during sleep,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080]   which might seem excessively detailed,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.240]   but it turns out that body position during sleep
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.160]   is critical for ensuring that the sleep you get
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.120]   is optimally restorative.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.480]   As with the first two episodes of this six-episode series,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.000]   today's third episode is filled with both science,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.440]   that is the biology of sleep and napping and body position
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.280]   and how those relate to one another,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.600]   as well as practical tools that you can use
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.440]   to vastly improve your sleep.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.760]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.880]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.520]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.200]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.920]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.600]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.200]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800]   I've been doing therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.880]   Initially, I had to do therapy against my will,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000]   but of course, I continued to do it voluntarily over time
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.480]   because I really believe that doing regular therapy
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.920]   with a quality therapist is one of the best things
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.600]   that we can do for our mental health.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.520]   Indeed, for many people, it's as beneficial
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280]   as getting regular physical exercise.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.440]   The great thing about BetterHelp
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.720]   is that it makes it very easy to find a therapist
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600]   that's optimal for your needs.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.520]   And I think it's fair to say
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.200]   that we can define a great therapist
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.000]   as somebody with whom you have excellent rapport,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.920]   somebody with whom you can talk about
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.200]   a variety of different issues,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.000]   and who can provide you not just support, but also insight.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.160]   And with BetterHelp, they make it extremely convenient
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.840]   so that it's matched to your schedule
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.400]   and other aspects of your life.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.960]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.880]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.680]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.960]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.040]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.600]   That means plenty of the electrolytes,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.520]   magnesium, potassium, and sodium, and no sugar.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   As I mentioned before on this podcast,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.880]   I'm a big fan of salt.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.720]   Now, I wanna be clear,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.000]   people who already consume a lot of salt,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.960]   or who have high blood pressure,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.280]   or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.840]   that typically contain salt,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.440]   need to control their salt intake.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.280]   However, if you're somebody who eats pretty clean,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.720]   and you're somebody who exercises,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.280]   and you're drinking a lot of water,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.160]   there's a decent chance that you could benefit
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.800]   from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.040]   The reason for that is that all the cells in our body,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.800]   including the nerve cells, the neurons,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.680]   require the electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.040]   So we don't just wanna be hydrated,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.960]   we want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.920]   With Element, that's very easy to do.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.400]   What I do is when I wake up in the morning,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.760]   I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.620]   and I'll dissolve a packet of Element in that water.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.680]   I'll also do the same when I exercise,
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.080]   especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.360]   and sometimes I'll even have a third Element packet
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.000]   dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.960]   or sweating a lot, or if I just notice
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.160]   that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.380]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.800]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.000]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.040]   Again, that's drinkelement, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.760]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.680]   that has hundreds of different meditations,
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.960]   as well as scripts for yoga nidra
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.280]   and non-sleep deep rest, or NSDR protocols.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.260]   By now, there's an abundance of data showing
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.000]   that even short daily meditations
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.120]   can greatly improve our mood, reduce anxiety,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   improve our ability to focus, and can improve our memory.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.000]   And while there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.120]   most people find it difficult to find
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.700]   and stick to a meditation practice
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.280]   in a way that is most beneficial for them.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.300]   The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.920]   to learn how to meditate
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.640]   and to carry out your daily meditation practice
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.560]   in a way that's going to be most effective
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.160]   and efficient for you.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.560]   It includes a variety of different types of meditations
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.960]   of different duration,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.760]   as well as things like yoga nidra,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.960]   which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.060]   that allows you to emerge
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.000]   feeling incredibly mentally refreshed.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.660]   In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive,
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.940]   showing that after a yoga nidra session,
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.280]   levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.000]   are enhanced by up to 60%,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.240]   which places the brain and body
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.360]   into a state of enhanced readiness
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.840]   for mental work and for physical work.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880]   Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.520]   is that it provides a 30-day introduction course.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.120]   So for those of you that have not meditated before
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.600]   or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.680]   Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.040]   and regular meditator,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.960]   Waking Up has more advanced meditations
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.040]   and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.920]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.680]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.200]   and access a free 30-day trial.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.180]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.480]   And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.120]   Dr. Walker, welcome back.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.760]   - Dr. Huberman, an absolute pleasure.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.920]   - Let's talk about the different types of sleep
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.240]   because I think most people think of sleep
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.440]   as just one thing.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.600]   Most people sleep at night.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.040]   Some people also nap, a topic we'll also discuss today.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.920]   But it turns out there are a lot of different types of sleep.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.360]   What are the different types of sleep
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   and what do they do for us?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.260]   And I guess everyone's probably wondering already.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.840]   I certainly am.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.480]   What types of sleep are we already engaging in?
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.120]   Meaning am I involved in
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.960]   or having multiple types of sleep each night?
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.680]   - This is a fascinating question
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.440]   and it comes back to something we've discussed
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.160]   in a previous episode.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.300]   The different stages of sleep and how they unfold,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.800]   we've described that fascinating stuff.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.320]   What you're already asking though
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.260]   is an incredibly sort of subtle but relevant question.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.840]   How should I be sleeping in terms of the phases of sleep?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.640]   Should I have one phase?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.680]   Should I have two phases of sleep
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.920]   or should I have many phases of sleep?
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.760]   In some ways you can answer that question
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.360]   on the basis of the lifespan
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.820]   because how it is that we sleep
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   in terms of those chunking sessions changes as we develop.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.800]   To be clear in nomenclature,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   I'm saying monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic, unpack that.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.820]   Monophasic obviously just simply means a single phase,
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.100]   monophasic.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.380]   - And when you say phase, you mean one bout of sleep?
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.200]   - Correct.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.480]   So that would be within a 24 hour period,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.460]   you are having a single bout of sleep.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.120]   Biphasic then means that within that 24 hour phase,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.700]   you are having two bouts of sleep.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.980]   And we'll speak about how those bouts are split up.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.400]   Are they split up between two halves
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.500]   in the middle of the night
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.060]   or are they split up in terms of longer at night
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.540]   and siesta like nap in the afternoon?
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.180]   And then we can speak about polyphasic sleep.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.820]   Polyphasic sleep, we in sleep science
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.940]   have been using for many years in the context of infancy
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.300]   because there as any new parents will know,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.620]   infants do not just simply have a nice single bout of sleep.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.300]   They're up, they're down, they're up, they're down.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   And they have many bouts of sleep
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.100]   within that 24 hour period and that's polyphasic sleep.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.620]   The other term or the other application of that term,
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.940]   polyphasic sleep has been used more so
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.760]   in the sort of interesting biohacker movement.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.740]   And we'll come back to that perhaps later on.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.020]   So how do these different phases of sleep
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.140]   change across the lifespan?
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.940]   Well, we've already said that when you're an infant
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.000]   and you're first born, within the first year of life,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.420]   you are incredibly polyphasic
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.780]   and you are probably going through wake sleep phases
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.500]   every two hours.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.940]   Why do you do that?
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.420]   Why can't you just simply be born
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.180]   and sleep in a monophasic way?
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.700]   It's for at least two reasons.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.580]   First, an infant needs to feed every two hours.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.940]   So their energy needs and their food intake requirements
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.020]   dictate that you can't sleep for very long
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.580]   because you need to be awake to feed
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.740]   and then you go back to sleep.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.780]   Within probably the first six months,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.500]   things will start to change a little bit.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.580]   But the second reason that you are highly polyphasic
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.020]   when you are first born
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.140]   is because your suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.620]   and in another episode,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.020]   we spoke about the central master 24-hour clock
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.020]   that beats out your circadian rhythm,
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.400]   the rise and the fall, the wake and the sleep.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.980]   That has not yet developed.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.700]   It hasn't been glued into place into the brain,
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.380]   this 24-hour clock.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.380]   So the infant seemingly knows nothing about when it's light
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.700]   or when it's dark outside.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.380]   They're just awake or asleep, awake or sleep.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.940]   So that's the second reason.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.340]   Energy feeding needs is the first,
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.340]   and then an absence of yet a fully developed
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.380]   24-hour clock in the brain
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.900]   to beat out that beautiful dictated rhythm.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.260]   By about age one,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.060]   that number of phases of sleep are starting to decrease,
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.060]   but it's still highly polyphasic.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.180]   It's not until you get to probably age two or three
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.900]   that now you're starting to see this consolidation of sleep.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.340]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.340]   Sleep is now happening more dominantly
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.860]   in the night phase of the 24-hour cycle.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.660]   And there are fewer bouts of sleep during the daytime.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.620]   Then perhaps by the time you're in kindergarten,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.340]   you may be down to just two sleeps.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.340]   So now we've switched from polyphasic sleep as infants
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.420]   to biphasic sleep as kindergarten.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.340]   - Could you describe those biphasic patterns?
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.380]   I recall in kindergarten having nap time in the afternoon.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.220]   - Yeah.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.420]   - They'd put out these little mats
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.860]   and every kid would just kind of like roll up.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.140]   It's actually sounds really nice.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.700]   - It's one, you know, wouldn't,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.900]   and we'll speak about how some adults do this too,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.540]   but almost every kindergarten system
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.300]   that I've inquired about around the world,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.700]   different nations, they all have this nap time.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.980]   And any teacher will tell you
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.220]   if one of those children does not nap
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.980]   during that period of time, they are the loose cannon.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.860]   They are the live wire.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.340]   And in subsequent episodes,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.660]   we'll speak about exactly how sleep harnesses
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.780]   and improves our emotional and mental health
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.100]   and how it falls apart when we don't.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.100]   So that's how it certainly is emerging biologically.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.500]   And that's how we as a society
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.900]   respect that and accommodate that.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.020]   And then probably by the age of starting school,
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.540]   so sort of five or six,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.660]   now we're starting to see fully monophasic sleep,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.140]   children sleeping long bouts at night,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.060]   and then being able to sustain wakefulness during the day.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.300]   At that point, you have locked in your monophasic pattern,
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.300]   and that will continue throughout adulthood
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.220]   and into old age with a few caveats that we'll speak about.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.740]   So that's how sleep unfolds
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.460]   in the monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic sleep
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.340]   across the lifespan.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.660]   It doesn't quite tell you, however,
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.220]   how those different stages of sleep
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.620]   change across the lifespan.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.220]   So I've shown you the view of sleep across the lifespan
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.220]   through one lens of the microscope.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.300]   If we click down one lens
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.500]   and focus more deeply on the different stages of sleep,
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.540]   there we see a fascinating story.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.740]   In utero, for the most part,
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.820]   you are in a sleep-like state as a fetus
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.540]   once you get to a certain point of development.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.100]   In utero, that sleep-like state
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.940]   seems to be more so something that looks like REM sleep.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.900]   Now, it's not fully-fledged, full-fat REM sleep yet,
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.700]   but it seems to be something very much like REM sleep.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.220]   I say this because in the first episode,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.620]   I told you as we go into REM sleep
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.140]   and we start to, as adults, dream,
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.020]   the brain paralyzes the body
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.540]   so that the mind can dream safely.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.340]   Those kicks and those punches and those elbows
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.220]   that a mother will feel from the fetus
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.500]   seem to be during this dream state often,
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.060]   and I don't want to shatter any illusions
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.380]   of you start singing or you're cooing
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.180]   and you get these bumps and these elbows
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.740]   and these legs kicking and it's beautiful.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.060]   It is beautiful,
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.380]   but it turns out that it's probably the REM sleep state,
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.380]   but the muscle sort of paralysis has not yet developed.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.940]   So you're getting these electrical bursts,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.500]   this frenetic activity of REM sleep that we described,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.940]   but you're not getting any of the blockade
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.020]   of the motor output.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.900]   And so it expresses itself as these kicks and these bumps.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.380]   And then during the first six months of life,
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.540]   and at that point in the first six months,
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.780]   those infants are sleeping
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.060]   anywhere between 14 to 17 hours a day.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.140]   That's immense, isn't it?
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.540]   I mean, it's right up there.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.740]   If you look across phylogeny
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.060]   and you ask, which is by the way, a fascinating topic.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.340]   At some point, we should do a separate podcast
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.900]   on sleep across different species.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.300]   'Cause I know like me,
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.180]   you love the whole variety of species,
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.540]   but you've got elephants who will sleep
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.100]   as little as four hours.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.180]   And then you've got the little brown bat
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.900]   who is the rock star of sleep.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.740]   And it will sleep almost 17 to 18 hours a day.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.820]   It nudges out the sloth in that sense.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.700]   - Can I ask you a question about that little brown bat?
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.540]   - Yeah.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.100]   - Does it sleep hanging upside down?
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.940]   - It does.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.140]   - So it can't have sleep paralysis in its little claws.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.420]   - So it will not have that paralysis,
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.900]   but it goes through the stages of sleep very quickly.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.180]   And this happens with birds as well.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.780]   So birds that flock on a branch, they will sleep.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.940]   And they sleep in some fascinating ways.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.500]   Sometimes with one half of the brain,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.860]   sometimes with both halves.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.460]   But then you say, well, if I'm on a branch
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.460]   and there's this wonderful force
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.300]   called gravity underneath me and I go into REM sleep
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   and I have that muscle paralysis, which they do,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.340]   how does that work?
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.580]   Well, they only have very brief REM sleep periods
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.300]   that last just for a few seconds.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.620]   And then they regain their muscle tone.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.460]   - Got it.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.580]   - Couldn't help but ask.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.940]   - It's genius, isn't it?
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.060]   - The flora and the fauna.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.340]   - Oh, I love, don't get me started with that.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.420]   - But especially that the fauna enchant me that much.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.860]   So I don't wanna draw us off course,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.580]   but now we know that they can,
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.940]   that's why the bats don't fall.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.980]   That's why the birds don't fall.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.700]   - Correct, got it.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   So when you are then as an infant sleeping 14 to 17 hours,
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.300]   what's happening with those different stages of sleep,
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.620]   non-REM and REM?
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.380]   At that point, we can't really define
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.620]   and separate the different stages of non-REM
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.820]   because it's not yet fully formed.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.820]   But we have what looks like a REM sleep active state
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.420]   and a deep non-REM sleep passive state.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.420]   Almost 50% of the time that an infant and newborn is asleep
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.700]   is spent in REM sleep.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.140]   Why do I say that with some kind of wonder in my voice?
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.140]   Because as adults, we're perhaps down to maybe 20%
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.300]   of our time spent asleep is in REM sleep.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.460]   But 50% of the time when an infant is asleep,
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.260]   they are in REM.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.860]   Why would this be the case?
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.780]   And across all species that have REM and non-REM,
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.140]   the time when we see REM sleep in highest volume amount
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.740]   is always after birth.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   There is something special about REM sleep
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.980]   and its function during that early period.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.620]   And we now start to understand why.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.340]   When you are first born,
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.260]   you are still going through a huge amount
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.420]   of brain maturation.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.940]   And the recipe for the day there,
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.660]   unlike when we are teenagers,
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.100]   is exploding the brain with synapses,
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.580]   all of these connections throughout the brain.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.540]   What we've discovered is that REM sleep acts
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.900]   as an electrical fertilizer to stimulate the growth
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.180]   of these connections within the brain.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.620]   It's almost as though you could think about
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.420]   an internet service provider
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.500]   with this huge new neighborhood.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.020]   And the first call of business is to go in
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.980]   and wire up each one of those homes
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.740]   with these fiber optic cables.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.660]   That's what REM sleep is doing.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.380]   And if you start to deprive,
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.540]   and these were studies, gosh, done many years ago
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.340]   by Howard Rothwalk and others,
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.740]   if you deprive animals of REM sleep,
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.260]   you stunt the developmental growth of the brain.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.820]   - And presumably the whole animal.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.740]   - And yeah, as a consequence.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.100]   I mean, if you look at its social behavior,
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.820]   even just that, it's profoundly abnormal
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.860]   because you don't have that REM sleep developed brain.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.580]   I mentioned this not because there is any causal evidence,
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.700]   but we have seen REM sleep impairments
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.740]   in certain developmental disorders,
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.940]   such as autism, as well as ADHD.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.820]   I don't think there is any supportive evidence yet
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.460]   to come out with a claim that part of the trajectory
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.020]   underlying those conditions is abnormalities of REM sleep,
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.420]   but it's a very active area of research.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.540]   So it's a fascinating time though, during infancy,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.300]   when you get these huge amounts of REM sleep.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.140]   Why?
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.500]   Because of what we call synaptogenesis,
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.140]   which is simply the creation of synapses genesis.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.900]   Then as you move from six months
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.340]   across the next 18 months, something odd happens.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.780]   Total sleep time starts to decrease,
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.220]   REM sleep starts to decrease,
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.900]   but non-REM sleep actually increases,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.580]   even though total sleep time is decreasing.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.780]   And there's a strange peak in lighter stage non-REM,
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.660]   what we call stage two non-REM,
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.780]   and those sleep spindles that I was describing
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.380]   in the first episode, these bursts of electrical activity.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.340]   We will speak about the role of those sleep spindles
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.300]   in improving motor skill learning.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.780]   And we've done many, many years of work in this area.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.460]   Why is that relevant to this phase of life?
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.260]   That's right around the time when infants
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.700]   start to coordinate their limbs in a skilled way
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.620]   and begin to walk.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.100]   And we believe that it is part of the process
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.620]   of the development of the motor system,
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.780]   enabling walking to begin.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:32.900]   Amazing.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.580]   So then things will change further,
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.740]   sleep time continues to decrease.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.180]   And by about age five or six,
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.100]   now the cocktail blend of non-REM and REM
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.700]   is down to a stable ratio that will remain
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.620]   throughout the lifespan, which is a four to one ratio.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.980]   So about 20% of the time that you're asleep
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.620]   will be REM sleep.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.820]   And the remaining time will be,
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.460]   80% of that time will be non-REM sleep.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.660]   Provided one is getting sufficient total amounts of sleep.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.700]   Correct, and getting it at the right moments in time
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.780]   that we described in the first episode,
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.620]   getting that sort of that appropriate chronotype match
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.620]   to the 24 hour clock,
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.380]   that will certainly alter those things too.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.540]   So that's how sleep unfolds both at the first level
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.820]   of the lens, monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.820]   and then double clicking how the different stages
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.260]   of sleep unfold and what the reasons are behind that.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.260]   I then said, once we're adults, we become monophasic.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.140]   Yes, to a degree, but there is some contention
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.060]   about the way that we sleep in modernity,
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.260]   that we may not be sleeping in the way
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.140]   that we were designed to sleep,
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.380]   which brings us back to biphasic sleep.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.660]   In the first episode,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.540]   we spoke about this strange afternoon dip in our alertness
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.580]   that happens called the postprandial dip.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.660]   And it happens somewhere between the one to 4 p.m. region,
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.740]   and it's measurable,
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.020]   and it seems to be biologically wired into us.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.900]   If you look at certain cultures
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.140]   that are not touched by modernity,
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.660]   so we know those have studied hunter-gatherer tribes,
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.060]   they don't quite sleep the way that we do.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.580]   And they don't sleep the way that we do
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.380]   for at least two reasons.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.860]   The first is that they will often have
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.420]   a siesta-like pattern of behavior,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.180]   where especially in the hot, dry season,
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.740]   they will take a nap in the afternoon.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.420]   In the wet, cooler season, that may not be the case,
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   but they certainly have more of a biphasic pattern
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.420]   where they'll sleep longer at night
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.020]   and then have a short nap, siesta-like.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.860]   And then of course,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.860]   there are Latin and Mediterranean cultures,
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.300]   and they have this practice of the siesta-like behavior.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.820]   Coming back to the hunter-gatherer tribes,
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.660]   the way that they also do not sleep
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.900]   in a similar manner to that which we do
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.020]   is their timing of sleep.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.660]   They don't go to sleep as the sun goes down.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.860]   They will usually, on average as a group,
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.820]   they will usually go to sleep about two hours after sundown.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.420]   And then they will wake up, not with the rising of the sun,
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.140]   they wake up just before that.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.460]   And you think, are they predictive of the light?
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.460]   No, the thing that changes first
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.180]   before the sun truly rises is temperature.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.500]   And temperature is a very strong predictor
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.540]   that that forces them awake.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.780]   So when you think about how they're sleeping then,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.540]   consider the term midnight.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.300]   Most of us never really think about what the term means.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.700]   Midnight refers to the fact
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.820]   that it is the middle of the night.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.940]   But for most of us in the modern world,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.300]   that's the time when we're thinking about
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.660]   sending our last email or posting to social media.
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.660]   Midnight is no longer midnight for society,
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.780]   but it is for them.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.620]   - So should we be thinking about midnight
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.820]   as the middle of the night in the context
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.100]   of the extreme early person, morning person,
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.900]   who presumably likes to go to bed around 8 p.m.,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.100]   wake up around 4 a.m.?
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.580]   Most people hear 4 a.m. and they go, oh goodness,
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.420]   that's early.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.100]   Sort of like the mighty Jocko Willink
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.100]   is famous for posting images of his digital watch.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.060]   Usually I think it's 4.30 a.m., wake up,
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.580]   and that's when he starts his workout.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.180]   So his Twitter, I guess they call it xnowfeed,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.500]   and Instagram is replete with images of his watch, 4.30,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   and people think, goodness, that's early.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.420]   He was a guest on this podcast, spoken to him before,
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.020]   but he goes to bed pretty early, most nights.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.460]   So in some sense, midnight for him
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.780]   or for somebody with a similar schedule
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.740]   is truly middle of the night.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.260]   But for the other chronotypes,
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.180]   for people that prefer to go to sleep
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.940]   or who naturally get sleepy around 10 or 11 p.m.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.060]   or even later, how should they think about
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.740]   this biphasic, polyphasic business?
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.740]   Because at some level, we all have to reconcile
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.020]   our sleep schedule with the demands
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.380]   of work and family and so on.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.220]   - That's right.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.460]   So I was very specific when I said
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.180]   the hunter-gatherer tribes, on average,
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.260]   that's the way that they will sleep.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.660]   But like the rest of society, there's a huge distribution.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.020]   And there will be some proportion of them
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.700]   who are a little bit like Jocko,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.980]   who will be on the early side of that,
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.620]   on the very early side of that.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.940]   But then there are other people who are clear night owls,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.380]   and they may not be going to bed until 10 or 11
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.940]   and waking up later.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.380]   So there is a distribution there.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.420]   You don't have to worry that my statement of midnight,
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.100]   on average, that does seem to be when we are dislocated
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.620]   from all of the trappings of modernity,
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:09.620]   how a group of representative humans on average will sleep.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.900]   But there is huge, as I said, differences
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.580]   from one individual to the next.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.380]   By the way, you can ask the question,
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.180]   why do we have these things called chronotypes?
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.100]   Why is there such variability
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.340]   in how people have a preference for when they sleep?
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.380]   Wouldn't it just be easier if biology designed us
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.740]   all to be asleep at the same time?
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.180]   Not so.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.860]   We mentioned in the first episode
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.020]   that sleep is truly idiotic in the sense that,
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.460]   you know, you're not protecting yourself
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.380]   or the people that you care about.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.460]   And if everyone slept at the same moment in time,
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.860]   you as a collective and as an individual
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.940]   would be vulnerable for an eight-hour period,
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.980]   seven to nine-hour period.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.820]   But by way of this wonderful injection of variability
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.620]   as to preferences for when people sleep,
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.780]   maybe there are some people who are going to bed at 8 p.m.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.980]   and there are other people and they're waking up at 4 a.m.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.060]   There are other people who go to bed at midnight
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.940]   and wake up at 8 a.m.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.700]   So then think about that.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.540]   At some point, what you've done
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.940]   is that there will always be someone
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.460]   or a collection of people awake until midnight,
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.580]   and there will always be a collection of people
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.900]   who are awake starting at 4 a.m.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.380]   So as an individual,
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.980]   everyone gets their eight-hour opportunity,
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.340]   but as a collective, as a clan,
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.260]   you've reduced your vulnerability down by 50%
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.060]   because Mother Nature injected the variability
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.100]   by way of genetics of chronotype to distribute that
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.980]   and lessen the burden.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.020]   Does that make any sense?
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:50.860]   - It does.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.180]   And it reminds me of how the circadian rhythm,
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.420]   which we discussed in episode one,
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.220]   is about 24 hours, not exactly 24 hours.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.180]   The rhythm of the suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.860]   that generate the circadian rhythm, as I recall,
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.980]   is rarely exactly 24 hours.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.820]   It's 24.2 or 24.4.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.180]   And the idea in mind, the just-so story,
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.580]   is that that variation allows for entrainment
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.300]   matching to the outside light-dark cycle,
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.540]   which changes across the year.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.140]   So you don't want it rigidly 24 hours
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.340]   because if there's any variation in light-dark,
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.740]   which of course there is,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.100]   even at the equator across the year,
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.180]   there's subtle variations,
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.940]   but certainly as you move away from the equator.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.940]   And so these variations in your circadian rhythm clock,
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:42.340]   SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus, might be 24.2.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.980]   Mine might be 24.6, someone else 24.1.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.060]   And in that sense, allows some malleability
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.580]   to matching the circadian rhythm
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.100]   to outside light-dark rhythms.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.220]   Is that a decent parallel for what we're talking about here?
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.660]   - It is, it's a beautiful demonstration
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.260]   that there is always some,
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.260]   it's almost wiggle room in how biology is programmed
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.020]   because some degree of noise,
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.980]   almost stochastic noise, can be very beneficial.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.060]   And it's much more predictive
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.900]   of the way in which the world works.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.380]   And it's much more adaptive for a species to enact
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.100]   and to embrace that kind of variability.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.580]   And yours was a beautiful example
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.300]   that it's about 24 hours,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.100]   but it's certainly responsive to changes
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.460]   in light duration across the year.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.940]   And it has to be because we need to buckle ourselves
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.500]   to the light-dark cycle for optimal survival.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.660]   And here's another demonstration
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.900]   of where it's not about the circadian rhythm,
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.980]   but it's about the chronotype distribution,
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.700]   not within an individual across the year,
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.020]   but across individuals at any one moment in time.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.020]   And that variability, once again,
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.140]   provides a biological benefit.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.500]   - In the first episode, and again, now,
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.900]   you were discussing chronotypes.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.180]   And one thing that I've meaning to ask
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.380]   is you said that chronotype is genetically determined,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.940]   but does that necessarily mean it is directly inherited
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.980]   from mom and/or dad?
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.140]   Meaning if your parents are both extreme
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.060]   early morning types,
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.980]   will you grow up to be an extreme early morning type?
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.820]   You already established that during infancy
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.340]   and development, adolescence, et cetera,
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.820]   that our chronotype is somewhat masked
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.820]   by some of the developmental necessities.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.540]   But once we reach young adulthood
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.940]   and our chronotype has been established,
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.580]   can we look to our parents to determine
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.380]   whether or not we are more likely
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.940]   to be a morning person or a late shifted?
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.180]   - It's very unlikely to find anyone
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.140]   whose parents were both extreme morning types,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.340]   who is a neutral or an evening type,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.020]   and vice versa.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.700]   So my guess is that people with,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.700]   if they know of their biological parents
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.540]   and they know of their rhythms,
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.540]   it's highly likely that you will at some point acquiesce
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.220]   in your lifetime to being very similar to them.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   Now, there are certain life conditions and contexts
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.180]   where you can fight that.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.180]   If you're someone who is in punk rock band
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.140]   and you're touring all the time,
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.740]   even though your mom and dad may be morning types
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.700]   and you may be a morning type,
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.540]   you're on the road, you're playing gigs,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.780]   there's no chance.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.980]   But at some point, let's say you retire
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.700]   and you give yourself the opportunity
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.220]   to express your natural rhythm,
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.380]   you will go back to that.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.620]   So yes, it's highly genetic.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.740]   It's not entirely genetic.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.260]   There is some degree of modification
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.340]   that happens on the basis of context.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.980]   And I've just given you a good example of context
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.220]   and also your exposure to light.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.860]   You can be someone who is, let's say a neutral like me,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.140]   but if you're constantly invaded by electric light at night,
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.220]   you're drinking too much caffeine
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.900]   and you're on your laptop and your computer and your phone
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.380]   and you're always activated by social media,
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.700]   it's very easy for someone like me to drift
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.700]   and become a 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. person.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.580]   That's not my natural type,
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.180]   but context and the environment have shifted me.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.580]   But for the most part, yes to your question.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.860]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.220]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.740]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.380]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.020]   and is designed to meet all
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.980]   of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.100]   By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.340]   that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.140]   And indeed that is true.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.460]   Now, of course, I do consume regular whole foods every day.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.260]   I strive to get those foods mostly from unprocessed
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.140]   or minimally processed sources.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.660]   However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.340]   of fruits and vegetables each day.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.380]   So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins,
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.060]   minerals, prebiotic fiber,
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.420]   and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.780]   And of course, I still make sure
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.100]   to eat fruits and vegetables.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.300]   And in that way, provide a sort of insurance
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.940]   that I'm getting enough of what I need.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.260]   In addition, the adaptogens
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.180]   and other micronutrients in AG1 really help buffer
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.660]   against stress and ensure that the cells and organs
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.500]   and tissues of my body are getting the things they need.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.220]   People often ask me that if they were gonna take
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.500]   just one supplement, what that supplement should be.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.620]   And I always answer AG1.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.180]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.140]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.540]   to claim a special offer.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.220]   You'll get five free travel packs,
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.780]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.700]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.660]   - Okay, so getting back
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.980]   to these different phase opportunities for sleep,
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.460]   clearly I'm getting the language wrong here,
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.220]   but monophasic, biphasic, and polyphasic.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.260]   Could you give us a few more examples
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:14.260]   of different types of biphasic and polyphasic sleep?
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.980]   - So coming back to biphasic sleep,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.900]   I described one version once we are adults,
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.420]   which is the siesta-like notion,
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.620]   one long bout at night, short about during the day.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:29.380]   And that bout during the day is usually matching
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.180]   that drop in alertness that we described.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.380]   It sort of hits that sweet spot right there.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.380]   And it's quite easy for some people
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.980]   to fall asleep in that period.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.140]   - Between, somewhere between one and 4 p.m.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.980]   - One to four, yeah.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.540]   And I know it's a large window,
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.340]   but that just allows us to sort of know,
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.020]   okay, if you're someone like yourself,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.300]   who's a morning type,
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.060]   you would probably start to want to nap
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.300]   a little bit earlier if you were biphasic.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.500]   Someone like me, a neutral, probably an hour and a half,
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.900]   two hours later still.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.100]   But there is a different version of biphasic sleep
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.700]   for adults that has been described in the literature.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.780]   And it's fascinating, but I don't think it's biological.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.980]   It's the notion that some people will have heard
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   called first sleep, second sleep.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.660]   And now you are splitting your sleep into two phases,
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.020]   but they're split across the night.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.380]   So the idea is that you fall asleep
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.020]   and you'll maybe have four-ish hours,
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.860]   and then you wake up and you then are awake
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.780]   for several hours, and then you go back to sleep
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.940]   for another three or four hours.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:43.420]   If you look in history, in the record of human history,
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.580]   it's very clear that there were some cultures doing this,
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.940]   particularly if you look at some of the European cultures,
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.620]   Great Britain in particular, there is good evidence
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.540]   that somewhere between about the 15th to 19th century
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.700]   seems to have ended during the kind of Dickensian era.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.300]   People were describing this behavior
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.580]   and they would wake up in the middle of the night
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.060]   after about four hours, they would make food,
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.020]   they would play music, they would write,
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.340]   they would make love.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.660]   It was a real thing.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.140]   And I'm not suggesting that it did not happen.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.900]   It clearly did, and there's a great book that outlines this.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.940]   But is it the way that we were designed to sleep,
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.580]   biphasically versus the siesta-like?
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.460]   And I don't think it is.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.540]   There is no good collection of evidence.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.420]   If you look at the biology of our human rhythms
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.180]   that argues that there is this magical period
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.740]   of a huge spike in our circadian rhythm that happens
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.740]   right in the middle of the night that should force us awake.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.820]   There is one paper that's often cited for this.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.940]   And in truth, that paper, if you read it,
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.500]   says nothing about first sleep, second sleep,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.180]   doesn't speak about biphasic sleep at all.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.260]   And that paper I think is unfairly used
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.380]   as a justification of first sleep and second sleep.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.660]   And the paper to me has at least three problems.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.540]   It's a great paper.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.380]   There's no problem with the paper and its hypothesis,
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.700]   but its use as justification for first sleep,
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.340]   second sleep has three problems.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.100]   The first is the artificial nature of the study.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.460]   They weren't designing it to test the hypothesis,
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.100]   but they had individuals in bed for 14 hours straight
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.020]   relative to a standard eight-hour period.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.340]   And sure enough, what they found was that
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.380]   when you force people night after night
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.300]   to be in bed for 14 hours,
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.780]   somewhere after about six or seven hours, they wake up.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.340]   And then you can't get out of bed in the study.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.940]   So you just lie awake.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.100]   And then at some point, I don't know if it's through boredom
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.700]   or you drift back off into sleep.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.940]   And that was argued as a clear demonstration
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.740]   of this split sleep.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.340]   But as I said, they're awake usually
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.540]   for about six and a half, seven hours.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.580]   Also, there was no magical awakening period.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.620]   It's a probability distribution.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.420]   And what that means is if you look at the data,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.580]   it's just more likely that people will wake up
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.180]   after about six or seven hours,
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.820]   and then more likely that they will go back down into sleep.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.060]   It wasn't as though the whole experiment
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.900]   demonstrated a very clear termination of sleep
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.740]   that everyone had at that moment in time.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.260]   So that's the first issue.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.340]   And the second issue, which is first issue,
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.900]   it's kind of an abnormal thing, 14 hours forced in bed.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.020]   The second is it wasn't a clear separation.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.460]   It's just simply higher probability.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.540]   The final issue is that it was a study done
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.900]   in only seven individuals, healthy males.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.460]   And so I have yet to see it scaled up.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.940]   Did it happen, first sleep, second sleep?
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.900]   Yes, it did.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.260]   Is there any strong evidence
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.260]   that that's how we naturally were designed
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.900]   and have evolved to sleep?
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.540]   In truth, I don't think so.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.500]   At least I don't see good evidence right now
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.380]   of supporting that, but remain open to it.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.220]   - In episode one, we talked a little bit
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.460]   about body position during sleep
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:16.340]   and how different degrees of incline or decline
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   might impact some of the features of sleep.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.620]   And I can't help but ask now,
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.300]   as you describe this biphasic pattern
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.660]   for people that were essentially
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.260]   experimentally restricted to the bed,
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.620]   is there something about being horizontal
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.580]   that makes us sleepy?
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.700]   - There is.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.140]   And it's perhaps not for the reasons that you would think,
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.180]   which is, okay, I'm just pre-programmed
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.540]   when I lie down and my head hits the pillow.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.900]   It turns out that it seems to be temperature,
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.900]   that when your body is recumbent, lying flat horizontal,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.700]   the distribution of how your body is able
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:00.380]   to move blood around the different regions
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.100]   and decrease your core body temperature,
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.700]   meaning it can push blood, warm blood,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.300]   out of the core of your body to these surface areas.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.260]   And when you push it out to the surface areas,
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.860]   you release that heat.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.580]   It's this huge thermal dissipation that happens
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.340]   when we move blood out of the core to the surface,
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.580]   you emit that heat,
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.460]   and your core body temperature plummets.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.700]   When your body temperature,
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.340]   your core body temperature decreases,
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.580]   you have a higher likelihood of sleepiness.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.620]   In fact, it's very difficult for you
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.500]   to fall asleep if your core body temperature does not drop.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.300]   And by lying down, the body's,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   what we call vasoactive ability to distribute that blood
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.580]   in a way that is permissive for thermal dissipation
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.460]   of core body temperature is superior.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.260]   And that's the reason why we find it easier
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.660]   to fall asleep lying down than let's say semi-recumbent
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.140]   or certainly propped all the way up.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.980]   And it's probably the reason naturally we evolved
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.620]   just to lie down on the floor.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.620]   - Very interesting.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:13.060]   Maybe now's a good time to talk about biphasic sleep
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.780]   in the context of about of sleep at night
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.620]   and the afternoon nap.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.500]   You've mentioned this postprandial dip
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.740]   that most people experience between one and 4 p.m.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.940]   that many people try and combat with caffeine.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.900]   We will also talk about caffeine this episode.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.620]   It's such an interesting substance.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   And I think the most commonly used drug,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.700]   'cause it is a drug after all, worldwide,
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.260]   I think more than 90% of adults worldwide
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.060]   consume caffeine on a daily basis.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.900]   - That's correct.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.700]   And I believe it is after oil,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.780]   it may be perhaps the second
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.620]   or at least the third most traded commodity on this planet.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.260]   And it is what we call a psychoactive stimulant.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.460]   It is a stimulant.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.300]   And it's probably one of the only stimulants
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.340]   that we will readily give to our children
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.180]   and not be too concerned about it.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.860]   - We'll get to caffeine in depth
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.700]   a little bit later in this episode,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.460]   but I can't help but just mention that someone,
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.340]   I think it was Michael Pollan said that,
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.860]   "Caffeine is one of the few drugs
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.380]   "that almost everybody takes
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.940]   "just to quote unquote feel normal."
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.020]   I think sometimes sleep deprivation
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.620]   is simply just the absence of caffeine.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.780]   And so it's a very interesting chemical,
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.900]   which I have in truth changed my mind on.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.980]   And I'm happy to speak about why I've changed my mind,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.020]   but also some guardrails too.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.780]   - And we'll go there.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.340]   Meanwhile, I'll take a sip of my triple espresso here
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.300]   as we discuss naps.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.300]   Are naps good for us?
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.780]   Should we nap?
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.020]   What if we don't like naps?
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.940]   Why do we wake up from naps groggy sometimes
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.100]   and other times we feel refreshed?
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.700]   Tell us about napping.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:09.980]   - Naps are both good and bad depending on the situation.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.300]   Naps can be a double-edged sword in other words.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.140]   We and others have done lots of studies on naps
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.780]   and the benefits are fascinating and stunning.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.860]   I'll tell you about one study we did.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.220]   We had participants assigned to one of two groups
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.780]   and at midday they all learned a whole list of new facts.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.580]   So it was a study about learning and memory.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.180]   And then one group took a 90 minute sleep opportunity,
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.460]   sort of focused right around that drop in alertness.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.220]   The other just remained awake lying on a bed
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.860]   and they just watched a nature documentary.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.900]   And then five hours later,
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:54.020]   we had them do another learning session.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.540]   And so they've woken up after the 90 minute nap,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.540]   they've got through that sort of initial lull
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.100]   that we'll discuss what that is after you wake up.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.180]   Everyone's now back to operating temperature.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.020]   So in other words,
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.060]   I've had you try to cram in a whole list of facts at midday
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.820]   and then a whole list of facts, new facts again at 5 p.m.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.860]   And I can ask,
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.180]   what is the learning capacity of your brain at midday
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.980]   and at 5 p.m.?
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.300]   And is there any difference in your learning ability
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.860]   when you have had a nap in between versus not?
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.700]   And sure enough,
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.860]   what happened in the group that did not nap,
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.820]   their learning capacity gradually declined across the day.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.740]   The nap group,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.860]   they were able to sustain their learning.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.100]   And in fact, if anything, improve it.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.380]   And the difference between those two groups at 5 p.m.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.580]   was about 20%.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.020]   So that's certainly non-trivial in terms of,
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.540]   if you to say, here's a new compound
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.500]   that can boost your learning capacity by 20%,
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.420]   would you take it?
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   I suspect it would probably make some money.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.660]   So that's a demonstration of full learning and memory.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.460]   We did another study very much like that
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.500]   in terms of its design,
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.260]   but we looked at your emotional brain
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.380]   and we were showing people different types
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.540]   of emotional expressions and having them rate them.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.300]   And we did that firstly before a nap
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.220]   and then after a nap versus that same time
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.100]   in sort of midday versus 5 p.m.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.900]   And another group did not nap.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.340]   And sure enough, the group that did not nap,
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.900]   by about 5 p.m.,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.780]   they were starting to rate fearful faces and angry faces
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.180]   as much more fearful and much more angry.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.140]   But if you looked at the group that napped,
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.780]   it was different.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.660]   They actually lessened the response to fear
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.780]   and they blunted the normal increase
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.140]   in anger sensitivity across the day.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.660]   And the nap seemed to boost
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.540]   how positively you rated happy faces.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.620]   So a nap there had the ability
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:05.580]   to reset the magnetic north of your emotional compass.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.620]   And there was a beneficial, almost added rose tint
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.660]   to your worldview glasses after you'd napped.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.660]   What was also interesting in those two studies,
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.980]   two different types of sleep
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.860]   were transacting those benefits.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.300]   In the nap group that was doing the learning,
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   the learning benefit that they got
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.420]   wasn't just about them napping and sleeping.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.220]   It was about them having these sleep spindles.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.460]   The more of those sleep spindles that you had,
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.780]   the greater the restoration of your learning capacity
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.620]   when you wake up.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.980]   For the emotional recalibration that I described in the nap,
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.940]   that had nothing to do with sleep spindles
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.620]   or even non-REM sleep.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.820]   It required REM sleep to produce that benefit.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.100]   So there are certainly many benefits
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.300]   and we've looked downstairs in the body,
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.780]   blood pressure, cardiovascular measures, immune health,
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.620]   they all seem to benefit.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.500]   So at that point, everyone may be thinking,
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.820]   of course, this sounds good.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.420]   Not to mention the basics,
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.340]   which is your attention, your concentration,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:10.180]   your focus and your energy all improve by way of naps.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.500]   Even your decision-making.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.700]   - You said decision-making.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.220]   - Yeah, even your decision-making is improved.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.340]   So your capacity to make the correct decisional outcomes
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.540]   based on this weight of evidence that you're facing,
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.780]   that's also improved.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.820]   So almost all areas of cognition that we've looked at
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.740]   and many areas of your emotional and mood health
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:34.620]   we've looked at seem to benefit by way of a nap.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.380]   At that point you're thinking, so then what's the problem?
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.580]   The problem is that when you nap,
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.500]   you release some of that sleep pressure
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.420]   that's been building up.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.900]   So in the first episode,
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.620]   we spoke about a chemical called adenosine.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.060]   And the longer that you're awake,
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.180]   the more adenosine that builds up.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.860]   The more adenosine that builds up,
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.100]   the sleepier you will feel.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.340]   And after about 16 hours of being awake,
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.420]   you should have lots of healthy sleepiness
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.940]   of adenosine in your brain to put you asleep
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.900]   and keep you asleep.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.100]   And when we sleep,
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.980]   we are able to clear that adenosine from the brain.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.420]   So we wake up after seven to nine hours.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.340]   And if it's been good quality sleep,
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.500]   we're refreshed because we've cleansed the brain
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.140]   in part of that adenosine.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.500]   When you take a nap,
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.020]   like a pressure valve on a steam cooker,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:29.300]   you just release some of that healthy sleepiness
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.940]   that you've been building up.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.260]   So the dark side of napping
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.820]   is if you are struggling with sleep
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.140]   and you suffer from insomnia,
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.340]   the advice is do not nap during the day
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.820]   because you're setting yourself up
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.740]   for an even higher probability of failure at night.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.580]   Why?
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.740]   Because when you nap,
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.860]   you release some of that good sleepiness
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.940]   that we need to build up for you
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.780]   as someone who is struggling with sleep
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.060]   to give you the greatest chance
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.460]   of a weight of sleepiness on your shoulders.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.500]   So if you are not struggling with sleep
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.980]   and you can nap regularly,
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.020]   I would say naps are just fine
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.660]   and we can unpack what is an optimal nap
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.420]   and the protocol for what napping should be.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.220]   I would say that's great.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.740]   The only caveat is make sure
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.420]   that you're not napping too late into the day.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.020]   And this is one of the components
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.540]   of the protocol of how to nap
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.900]   because napping late in the day is too close to sleep.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.380]   And you can think of it
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.100]   almost like snacking before your main meal.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.180]   A nap late in the day
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.540]   just takes the appetite edge off your sleepiness
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.180]   so that when it comes time for sleep,
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.460]   you're not as hungry anymore.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.300]   So just keep that in mind,
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.700]   but we can unpack perhaps the optimal way to nap
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.380]   if you are going to nap
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.460]   and exactly the do's and the don'ts of that
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.980]   if that sounds of somewhat interest.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:57.540]   - That is of immense interest to me
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.660]   and I know many other people.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.340]   I'm a huge believer in naps.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:05.180]   I've always enjoyed short naps of about 10 to 30 minutes
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.820]   unless I'm somehow sleep deprived,
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.100]   in which case I will sleep for an hour
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:10.940]   or even a little bit more,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.860]   but I make sure I set an alarm
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.140]   really based on advice that you gave me,
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.580]   which was to first of all,
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.460]   decide whether or not a nap is beneficial for me
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.420]   or for whoever is considering that.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.700]   But then to make sure that however long that nap is,
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.500]   zero to 90 minutes,
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.020]   let it not be longer than 90 minutes
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.460]   because the real goal is to not disrupt nighttime sleep.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.300]   - That's right.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.180]   - Which is essentially just a more long-winded way
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.380]   of saying what you just said.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:43.380]   So how does one determine the optimal duration of nap?
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:48.740]   And in particular to avoid the problem
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.300]   of disrupting nighttime sleep by napping,
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.300]   but also this rather common phenomenon
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.660]   of waking up and feeling kind of groggy
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.420]   or even kind of grumpy.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.260]   I get the post-nap face,
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:03.100]   or we should call it the post-nap expression.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:03.940]   - You need to trademark that.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.780]   - The PNE, right, the PNE.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.620]   What's your PNE?
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.180]   Do you wake up for morning too,
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.320]   some people wake up and they're like,
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.660]   that face, and then there's the like, good morning.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.900]   You know, and I think people that wake up
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.020]   with a good morning are particularly delightful
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.660]   unless you're of the post-nap expression
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.380]   that is kind of the crumpled face,
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.300]   and then you just, you don't want to be around those people.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.620]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:30.380]   - Yeah, and this probably relates to spirit animals
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.220]   and things like that.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.700]   Some people wake up like a cheerful chipmunk
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.700]   and other people seem to wake up like my bulldog Costello,
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.060]   where it's, you know,
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.860]   jowls still in contact with the floor.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.860]   - Yeah, so PNE, I'm trying to hold it together
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.820]   and not absolutely just fall apart.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.100]   It's brilliant, please trademark it.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.100]   So firstly, to your question, how to optimally nap.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.260]   The word optimal is interesting
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.980]   because when you, people say, how long should I nap?
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.060]   What's the optimal nap duration?
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.380]   The question I have back to them is,
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.620]   what are you trying to optimize?
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.900]   Because once I understand what you're trying to optimize,
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.980]   I can give you a better prescription,
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.820]   non-medical I'm talking about here,
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.700]   a better sort of, you know, protocol piece of advice
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.140]   for how to nap.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.420]   I mentioned the study about emotional phases
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.540]   in part for a specific reason,
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.900]   'cause I told you there the benefit came by way
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.340]   not of non-REM sleep, but REM sleep.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.580]   And in our first episode,
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.540]   we said that when you go through these
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.620]   on average 90 minute cycles,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.220]   you get most of your non-REM sleep first
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.060]   and then you'll have this bout of REM sleep at the end.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.860]   And it always seems to go that way
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.900]   when you are a healthy, normal person.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.580]   You go into non-REM sleep and then you go into REM sleep.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.540]   It's very rare that you ever go directly into REM sleep.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.540]   There are only two reasons when that seems to happen.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.260]   The first is a clinical condition called narcolepsy
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.220]   where you can have sleep onset REM sleep
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.500]   and it's very rare.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.060]   The second is if you are horrifically deprived of REM sleep
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:05.380]   night after night after night, I let you sleep then.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.340]   At that point, REM sleep, the pressure for REM sleep
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:13.340]   has been built to the point of being almost just insatiable
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.980]   and your brain goes straight into REM sleep.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.620]   But with those two things aside,
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.740]   you go into non-REM sleep first.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.820]   So I brought up the emotional study
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:27.380]   of resetting your sort of mood compass
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.260]   because to get that REM sleep,
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.940]   you had to nap for a longer period of time
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.940]   because you had to get through the non-REM sleep first
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.740]   before you get the REM sleep.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.740]   But let's come back to then assuming optimal is
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.060]   for most people when they speak about naps,
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.220]   I just want the quick reboot.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.220]   I want my alertness and concentration which are failing
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.940]   because I'm staring at the screen
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.340]   or I just can't concentrate on the work that I'm doing.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:57.180]   I want my alertness and my concentration to be improved.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.620]   I want that sort of slight boost in brain energy
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.180]   where I know I can sustain myself for now
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.460]   along the period of time.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.100]   And I've got the motivation, which is really in some ways
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.500]   how I like to think about energy as well.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.500]   I've got the motivation, the drive to keep going,
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.260]   which is just starting to fail me.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.420]   To get those basic things,
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.580]   which is what most people nap for,
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.060]   aim for a 20 minute nap.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.620]   Why 20 minutes?
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.340]   If I thin slice the nap duration
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.260]   and those studies have been done
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.260]   where we look at essentially
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.020]   what's called a dose response curve.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.740]   I give you five minutes of a nap, 10 minutes of a nap,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.620]   15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 90 minutes.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:42.780]   After five or 10 minutes, you don't really get very much.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.860]   You will wake up and you'll have some degree
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.460]   of improved alertness and your basic reaction time
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.820]   may be a little bit quicker,
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.300]   but that fades very quickly
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.260]   and you don't sustain that benefit.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.100]   Once you get past about 15 to 17 minutes,
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.220]   now things start to look different.
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.780]   You get these nice benefits
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.020]   for concentration alertness and motivation
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.180]   and those things sustain.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.740]   So once you wake up out of that,
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.380]   probably really, I would say 20 minute nap.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.780]   At that point, you've got some good wind
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.140]   in your concentration and energy sails for the brain
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.860]   and that will sustain you throughout the rest
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.180]   of the afternoon and into the evening.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.940]   The benefit of the 20 minute nap
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:32.180]   is that you don't get the PNE,
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.540]   trademark Andrew Huberman.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.020]   You don't get that almost sleep hangover.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.860]   So some people will say, it's strange, I nap.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.940]   Maybe I'll nap 45 minutes, 50 minutes and I wake up.
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.580]   And to be honest, Matt,
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.500]   I almost feel worse after the nap than I did before.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.900]   And I don't understand it.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.700]   It's something called sleep inertia.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:01.380]   And an extreme version of this is in the first two hours
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.740]   of your night of sleep, you get a phone call
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.980]   or an alarm goes off and you wake up
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.180]   and you are just kind of lost in the ocean.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.660]   You're looking around at your surroundings.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.060]   You're just in this groggy state.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.540]   You're half awake, half asleep.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.140]   When you can respond and you can do things,
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.740]   but boy, does it feel miserable.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.020]   And it's almost as though you're going
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.660]   from the ground floor right up to the penthouse suite,
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.500]   but you get stuck somewhere in between kind of floor 13
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.940]   and it's this rough state.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:38.540]   If you go out into sleep, light stage one non-REM,
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.780]   then stage two non-REM.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:44.020]   And just before you get into the very deeper stages
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.820]   of non-REM, three and four,
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.980]   that starts to happen around 30 to 40 minutes
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.780]   for most people.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.740]   But by cutting your nap off at 20 minutes,
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.340]   you still get these nice benefits
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.100]   from a good chunk of healthy non-REM sleep,
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.700]   but you're not going so far into the cycle,
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.100]   so deep into your non-REM
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.780]   that when you wake up after 20 minutes,
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.900]   you're not in that what we call sleep inertia phase,
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.940]   that sleep grogginess, that sleep hangover phase.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.740]   So it's a nice benefit that you get
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.780]   all of these improvements in your brain,
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.660]   but you wake up and very quickly
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.420]   you're back up to operating temperature
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.860]   and you don't suffer that inertia.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.980]   Now that's not to say that when you sleep
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.860]   or you nap longer,
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.140]   you don't start to get more benefits, you do.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.100]   And those benefits are both greater in their magnitude
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:38.420]   and sustain for a longer period of time, they do.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.020]   It's just that you have to understand the trade-off
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:41.980]   that you will suffer,
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.700]   which is I will get more bang for my buck
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.620]   and I will get more benefits,
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.460]   but I will in the first sort of hour or so
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.740]   have to understand that at that point,
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.100]   I may even be functioning worse
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:00.380]   than that which I did before I even started napping.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.980]   But if you're patient and you go through it,
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.100]   the rewards on the other side
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.980]   are significantly better still.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.020]   So that's the first piece of advice.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.940]   And when it comes to how to nap,
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.420]   I would say the dose and the timing make the poison
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.060]   and poison is hyperbole here.
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.380]   It's simply just the poison being
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.580]   how much sleep inertia you're going to suffer.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.660]   So aim for about 20 minutes.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.500]   That's the dose.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.820]   The timing comes back to that which we described before.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.260]   Do not nap too late into the day.
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.100]   So what's the rule of thumb here for a protocol?
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.820]   On average, for the average adult,
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:41.100]   I would say don't nap after about 3 p.m.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.500]   20 minute naps, sometime between 3 p.m.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.060]   And if you're struggling with sleep, don't do this at all.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:51.500]   If you're not and you're able to get to sleep fine,
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.860]   this seems to be a good ingredient
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.780]   for the basic return on your investment.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:01.540]   Again, if you tell me what's the optimal nap duration,
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.380]   we need to have a conversation to understand
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.060]   what is it that you're going after here?
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:05.980]   What are the benefits?
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:10.140]   And then I can sort of create a finger buffet,
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.380]   kaleidoscope match to what you need,
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.780]   and we can think about the nap duration as a consequence.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:16.620]   - Thank you.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.180]   That's very informative.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.660]   I have a colleague at Stanford who's a Howard Hughes
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.580]   investigator, which for those that don't know
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.420]   is a rather elite club of academic researcher.
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.820]   They have to essentially try out for it.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.100]   They can, every five years they go up for renewal.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:36.020]   It's a lot of money, which gives them a greater capacity
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:39.260]   to take on greater risk work, higher risk work.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.380]   And he's also a member of the National Academy,
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.220]   and he was one of these people who graduated high school
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.740]   at 15 years of age, one of these phenoms.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.500]   And he is so religious about his napping,
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:55.060]   such that when he travels to give seminars at other schools,
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.020]   he insists that they schedule a nap time
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.420]   for him after lunch.
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:03.420]   And in his office, you know, between 1230 and 1 p.m.,
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.060]   he's napping, everyone knows this.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:08.300]   And I mentioned this because I think that oftentimes
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.940]   people think of the nappers as the lazy ones,
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:14.740]   but his output is near superhuman.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.380]   And he attributes much of that output to the nap,
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.780]   not just the post-nap work that he's able to perform,
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.820]   but his ability to just kind of manage so many ideas.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.060]   He has an enormous laboratory,
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.180]   and that's just one example.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.660]   I think there are examples from sport,
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:34.660]   of sprinters taking naps on the side of the track field.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:39.100]   I mean, so it seems that a capacity to nap
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.060]   is also something worth considering,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.860]   because I think many people listening to this are thinking,
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.140]   well, I can't nap.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.260]   Should I nap, you know?
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.060]   And can one teach themselves to nap?
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.460]   So that's the question,
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.740]   if one would want to explore napping.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.260]   And is that something that one should even consider doing?
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.780]   If you don't have a propensity to nap, should you avoid it?
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.980]   If you want to try naps,
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.940]   how could one teach oneself to nap?
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.060]   You just mentioned earlier lying down
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.060]   relates to body temperature,
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.940]   body temperature relates to sleepiness.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.060]   And then as a third question,
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.260]   I promise I'll repeat these if we need to.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.460]   As a third question,
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.420]   I'd like to have a little bit of a discussion
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.660]   about some of the pseudo-nap states
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.740]   that I certainly am intrigued by.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.300]   You know, for instance, just lying down
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.700]   and I'm doing a progressive bodily relaxation,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.420]   things like yoga nidra, non-sleep deep rest,
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.860]   which is an acronym I coined
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.580]   simply to make it clear what I was talking about,
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.220]   but it's very similar to yoga nidra, things of that sort.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.780]   In other words, put simply,
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.020]   should everyone think about having
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.340]   an early to mid-afternoon protocol
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.380]   to reset their cognition in their body?
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.700]   We call it a nap, but does it have to be a nap?
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.460]   And if we're not good nappers, should we try?
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.420]   And if so, how should we go about it?
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.940]   - Yeah, so to your three questions,
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.780]   firstly, if you're not a natural napper,
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.100]   should you start doing it?
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.460]   If you want to start doing it, how should you do it?
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.900]   And then the third is,
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.060]   is there some kind of, you know,
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.300]   substitute for a like kind,
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.820]   which would be these,
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.940]   I'd love the phraseology that you use,
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.820]   these liminal states.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.980]   Do they mimic that?
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.340]   Are they different to that?
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.340]   How should we think about those?
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.620]   The first thing I would say to point number one,
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.580]   if you are not a natural napper,
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.820]   don't necessarily force yourself to be.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.180]   As long as you're getting the sleep
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.980]   that you feel you need at night,
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:32.900]   and you feel refreshed and restored during the day,
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.980]   and you don't have that sort of postprandial drop
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.340]   to the point of thinking,
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.660]   I almost need to nap during the day.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.940]   There is no pressure,
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   based on anything I've been telling you,
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.700]   for you to start napping,
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.940]   nor should there be any reason that you do start napping.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.620]   But let's say that you want to try.
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.140]   What would be the right protocol
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:56.060]   to improve and increase the likelihood?
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.820]   The best way you can do this
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.500]   is to mimic nighttime as best you can.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.860]   So wherever you are, if you can,
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.100]   shut off the lights,
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:12.020]   make sure that you can block out curtains, blinds.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.300]   If you can't do that fully,
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.460]   and many people won't be able to,
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:19.100]   develop an eye mask procedure.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.980]   So put an eye mask on,
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.940]   make sure you block out noise, earplugs.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.460]   You can use a sound machine if you want,
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.140]   and we can speak about sort of sound machines
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.500]   and whether or not they're good or bad on sleep.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.220]   And then you can lie down,
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.100]   make sure that you try to take your shoes off
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.420]   and get under some kind of a blanket,
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.300]   because we're so contextually cued
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.060]   by having something wrapped around us
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.780]   called a blanket or a duvet,
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.460]   that to do it without that,
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.260]   if you are not a natural napper, can help you.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.860]   Again, some people will say,
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.740]   I can just kick my feet up on my desk,
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.140]   sit back in my reclining chair in the office,
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.420]   and I can fall asleep, that's great.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.780]   But if you're not a natural person,
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.100]   I'm just trying to tell you things
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.820]   that increase the probability of that.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.100]   And then set the alarm.
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.900]   I like your idea of making sure that if you do fall asleep,
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.660]   you don't accidentally go too long
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.860]   and then just feel miserable.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:16.780]   So mimic the conditions that you're trying to get
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.500]   that you would normally get at night.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   That will increase the probability.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.540]   Mask out noise, mask out light, kick your shoes off,
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:28.100]   have some kind of a blanket wrapping around you.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.940]   That's probably the best.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.820]   And then time it based on this sort of postprandial drop.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.100]   You will know yourself, everyone has fallen prey to it.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   You know, it's usually around about three, 4 p.m.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.420]   that I do start to feel this decline,
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.020]   or it's around 1 p.m.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.540]   Try to match it in accordance with that.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.060]   So those are the first, I think, two questions.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.900]   Should you?
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.260]   Not necessarily.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.940]   If you would like to and are not normally doing it,
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.780]   how can you do it?
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.820]   The final point I think is fascinating,
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.820]   which is these alternate states of conscious brain activity.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:10.580]   The most obvious is when we're awake and when we're asleep.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.380]   Those are the two most dramatic changes in consciousness
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:18.060]   that we experience on a daily basis, short of anesthesia.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:21.300]   I've become, like you, very fascinated
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.380]   by these sort of both meditative states
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.700]   or these liminal states.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.500]   I think at some point you and I should collaborate
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.420]   and we should do some work and really unpack this.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.060]   But the reason I find this interesting
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.820]   is because I'm going to guess
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:38.260]   you are having sleep-like states,
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.740]   but you are not fully asleep.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.900]   How would I define a sleep-like state?
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.060]   What we've learned is that your brain,
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.900]   the way it sleeps, isn't en masse.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.140]   It's not as though your entire brain sleeps.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.020]   Different territories of your brain
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.420]   can sleep in different ways.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:03.300]   And what we've also known, and there's some argument,
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.020]   even individual brain cells seem to have a period
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.620]   where they go into sleep.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.340]   And these individual neurons will start to show
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.980]   what look like these beautiful, big, powerful,
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.420]   deep, slow waves in terms of their firing rate, at least,
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.500]   in terms of those neurons firing away.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.940]   I bring this up because if that means
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:26.460]   that your brain can have local sleep
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.060]   rather than global sleep,
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.940]   if you are in global sleep, you're out like a light.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.620]   You are asleep.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.060]   But perhaps these liminal states,
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.940]   the reason that they give these benefits
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.140]   is because you are still awake, not global sleep.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.940]   So if you're in global sleep, you're asleep,
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.340]   but you're awake, so you're not in global sleep,
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.620]   but you may be having local sleep.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.380]   Now, using special setups in my laboratory,
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:57.420]   we can apply tens, maybe hundreds of electrodes
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.540]   all over your head, and we can map
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.380]   the different places where your brain is having sleep
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.660]   in much higher resolution.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   So rather than a 480 DPI movie on YouTube,
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.540]   I'm now in 4K resolution.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.060]   I can really dismantle what's going on
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.780]   analytically in your brain.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.500]   I'm going to guess that when you're going into these states
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.460]   and you report coming out of those states,
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.900]   and I ask you, on a scale of one to 10,
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.300]   how would you rate that as an experience
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.180]   based on your common experience?
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:38.500]   The greater the intensity of the liminal benefit
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.740]   and state that you experienced, I'm going to predict
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.660]   is directly related to the extent of this local,
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.420]   deep, non-REM, slow-wave sleep that's happening.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.940]   You're still awake, but some parts of your brain
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.180]   for maybe seconds of time, or maybe even tens
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.540]   of seconds of time, I'm going to bet,
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.100]   will be oscillating in what look like
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.180]   slow-wave sleep, deep sleep states.
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.420]   And if all I would be able to look at
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.060]   is that one part of your brain
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.140]   and that small cluster of electrodes,
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.220]   and someone said to me, "Is this person awake or asleep?"
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.780]   I would say, "Oh, they're asleep, they're in deep sleep."
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.140]   But then if you slowly reveal and back out
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.740]   and show me the rest of the brain and what it's doing,
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.580]   I would say, "Oh my goodness,
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.660]   no, this person must be awake."
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.300]   But that local territory, that district up there
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.220]   in their brain, they were having slow-wave sleep.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:32.260]   I think that's what we could find.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.060]   And that may predict some of the benefits that you get,
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.260]   some of the productivity energy benefits.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.820]   By the way, I should note that with all of this nap,
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:45.260]   racket, NASA figured this out back in the 1980s.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.860]   They were looking at ways to optimize their astronauts
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.100]   because when you are up in orbit,
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.820]   depending on what orbit you're in,
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.540]   you are rotating around the planet
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.940]   maybe 10, 20 times per 24 hours.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:02.940]   So you're seeing 10 to 20 sunsets and sunrises.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.060]   So your sleep is a total mess.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.300]   And you can safety check almost everything
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.060]   in terms of technology.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.620]   But the one weak link in a space mission
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.180]   is this thing called the human being.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.340]   That's where errors typically happen.
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.940]   So how do you de-risk a human error up in space?
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:24.100]   Because if you make an error up there,
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.460]   I mean, on the ground, not great,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.300]   up there, kind of catastrophic.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.340]   You can try to optimize the ability to sleep
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.100]   and their ability to maintain focus,
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.540]   concentration, alertness, and productivity.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:39.020]   And what they found was that these naps
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.500]   produced almost a 20% boost in short naps,
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.140]   20% boost in their alertness,
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:50.020]   and almost a 50% boost in their task productivity.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.460]   And it was so powerful that it translated
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:57.460]   to the terrestrial employees of NASA on the ground.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.140]   And it became what was known as the NASA nap culture.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.860]   And from there on, we had what were called power naps.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.420]   Power naps, by the way, why are they called power naps?
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.740]   And you think, well, just because it powers me up.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.820]   It's a good idea, but it's wrong.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.540]   It has a very specific story, a fascinating one.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:21.540]   Two legends in my field, David Dinges and Mark Rosekind,
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.660]   they were looking at how to instigate risk mitigation,
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:29.740]   not in astronauts, but in pilots
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.340]   who are doing long haul flights.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:36.180]   Because the most dangerous aspect of a long haul flight
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.740]   is when it is coming down to land.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.740]   And that's when they can sometimes have these things
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:44.980]   called a catastrophic hull loss,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:49.540]   which is a euphemistic phrase for a terrible plane crash.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.460]   And they were trying to say,
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:54.860]   how could you use naps strategically to de-risk that
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.420]   and improve their alertness?
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.140]   And they asked a very interesting question.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.380]   If they can nap for only a certain period of time,
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.620]   because they have to be at work on the plane
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.380]   for the rest of it, when should you place that nap?
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.540]   Should you do it at the start of the long haul flight,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.420]   in the middle or towards the end?
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.740]   And most people would bet, like they I think did,
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.780]   it's best to place it at the end
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:23.220]   when you're really starting to struggle, get that boost.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.980]   And then you wake up, you're not in sleep inertia
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.300]   'cause it's been brief.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.900]   And then you're energized for landing.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.220]   They didn't find that.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.260]   They found that the most optimal time to nap
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:37.820]   was early on in that long haul flight.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.980]   And it sustained them throughout the rest of the flight.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:45.020]   Now they took their findings to the FAA
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.060]   who are funding the work
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.660]   and the Federal Aviation Authority
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.220]   here in the United States.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.220]   And they said, we've got some great findings
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.700]   and we think we should implement this.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.660]   And we would like to use a term
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.780]   to help pilots understand this.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.420]   And it's called prophylactic napping.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:07.700]   And of course there were many chuckles throughout the room,
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.260]   perhaps inappropriate.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.380]   And they just said, look, you've got to understand
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.220]   our pilots that, you know, kind of alpha male guys.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.340]   And if you're starting to say
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.260]   you need to prophylactically nap,
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.660]   it's not gonna be adopted.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.180]   That's a no-go.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.700]   So they looked around the room
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.500]   because it's an alpha male culture.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.660]   It's a mostly masculine culture at that time.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.780]   They said, what could we,
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.060]   and there's a lot of beard stroking.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.620]   And they said, I've got it, power naps.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.980]   It's gotta be about power.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.660]   And so that is where if you've ever wondered
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.940]   where the term power naps come from,
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.820]   it's not because it reboosts your power,
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.420]   which it does and boost it back up.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.140]   It's because there was chuckles at the time,
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.060]   prophylactic napping.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.180]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.460]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Eight Sleep.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.100]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.780]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.020]   Many times on this podcast,
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.980]   we discuss how in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.140]   your body temperature actually needs to drop
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.900]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.260]   And in order to wake up feeling maximally refreshed
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:11.020]   and energized, your body temperature needs to heat up
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.740]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:15.020]   Eight Sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.140]   of your sleeping environment
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.060]   so that it's easy to fall and stay asleep
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.740]   and wake up feeling refreshed.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.780]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.740]   several years ago,
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.020]   and it has completely and positively transformed my sleep.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.820]   So much so that when I travel to hotels or Airbnbs,
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.060]   I really miss my Eight Sleep.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.140]   I've even shipped my Eight Sleep out to hotels
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:32.980]   that I've been staying in
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.940]   because it improves my sleep that much.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.180]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.220]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.100]   to save $150 off their pod three cover.
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.120]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.540]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.620]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.260]   The naming of things fascinates me,
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.260]   especially in the landscape of health and wellbeing also.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:04.220]   And that's one reason why having become a real fan
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.020]   and practitioner of Yoga Nidra,
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.760]   which I think translates to yoga sleep,
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.400]   which is this process of lying down
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.940]   for a period of 30 to 60 minutes, progressive relaxation.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.700]   These are scripts that are readily available
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:20.700]   as this is an age-old practice in India.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.220]   That is meant to restore mental and physical vigor
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.900]   by placing one into one of these liminal states.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.340]   And I have great respect for the Nidra tradition,
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:36.520]   but sometimes the names are a separator.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.860]   So people who hear Yoga Nidra and they think,
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.120]   oh, it must be yoga movement.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.260]   And that's of course not true.
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.980]   Or they think that there must be
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.320]   some mystical component to it,
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.140]   which is not necessarily true.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.260]   Sometimes they include intentions and things like that,
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.420]   but often not.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.580]   So that's why I coined this phrase, non-sleep deep rest,
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:56.740]   which is essentially maintains the critical components
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.100]   of Yoga Nidra, but doesn't include intentions
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.500]   and has these shorter 10 or 20 minute protocols.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.100]   So it'd be great fun.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.700]   And I think very interesting for us to do that project,
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.500]   to explore what are the brain's activation states
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.820]   or deactivation states as the case may be
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:17.820]   in these non-traditional or liminal state practices.
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.220]   Now, along the lines of power napping,
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.020]   specifically in the naming of power napping,
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.580]   I think it's more than just an anecdote,
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.340]   because I think it is very important
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.340]   for people to understand that these protocols,
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:37.660]   these tools that NASA and that laboratories have developed,
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.180]   oftentimes are for other purposes,
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.700]   but they translate to a kind of broader significance.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.660]   And what I'm hearing and what I'm starting to integrate
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.500]   as we have today's conversation is that it seems
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   that there is pretty good reason to at least explore
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.600]   biphasic sleep, right?
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.980]   That for the non-nappers to really think about
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.420]   whether or not they would like to explore napping,
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.620]   as you mentioned, they don't have to.
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.720]   And then for people who are already napping,
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.500]   to really think about the placement of that nap
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.960]   within the day and the duration of that nap.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.540]   What you told us a few moments ago suggests
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.140]   that I should be doing, or anyone that's doing naps
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.980]   or entering these liminal states like NSDR,
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.540]   might wanna shift them a little bit earlier
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.500]   than the period in which they first become sleepy
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.060]   to take that nap.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:27.940]   Is that right?
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.300]   I mean, so for instance, should I do as my colleague
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:34.540]   and finish lunch and lie down for 10, 15 minutes
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.060]   rather than wait until two or 3 p.m.?
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.580]   Is that something that could make a meaningful difference?
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.660]   - I think it could.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.660]   And I think it really, again, depends on how much
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.500]   of a struggle sleep becomes in the evening for you.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.960]   If it is becoming the later that you nap,
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.060]   if your sleep becomes either A,
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.540]   more difficult to initiate in the evening,
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.340]   or maybe you don't have any problems falling asleep.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.660]   But for some reason, when I look back,
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.700]   I'm now starting to wake up more throughout the night.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.240]   That in part, again, it's not just that
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.260]   if you nap late in the day, you struggle to fall asleep.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:09.500]   You may not.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.460]   The other consequence that can happen,
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.500]   which is non-mutually exclusive,
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.940]   is that you then stay in not as deep a sleep
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:21.260]   and your sleep is more fragile in that sense.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.340]   So the probability that you will wake up
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:28.260]   because you had the nap so late in the day
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.540]   is higher in the middle of the night.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.300]   And then when you wake up, like many of us do,
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.880]   and you go to the restroom or it's perfectly natural,
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.220]   but the speed with which you can then fall back asleep
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.980]   is compromised, why?
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.740]   Because you've jettisoned some of that sleepiness
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.220]   by way of the nap.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.180]   And there isn't as much to take you back down into sleep
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.700]   after you've woken up.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.260]   So I would just say that if you are seeing that pattern,
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.900]   that the later napping that you're doing,
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.140]   if you're doing that, and again,
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.860]   there's no reason that you need to nap
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.380]   only if you choose to nap.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.700]   If that's the case,
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.340]   then consider not necessarily obviating the nap.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:09.160]   That may not be required.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.580]   Just bring it back earlier, take it after lunch,
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.020]   see how things work out, do the experiment.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.260]   And when you do the experiment,
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.020]   make sure that you do what I would describe
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.380]   as the on-off-on experiment,
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:23.760]   which is where you're napping as you normally do,
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.660]   and you've noticed perhaps some problems with your sleep.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.380]   Then do, so that's sort of the,
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.200]   well, it's sort of the on-off-on phase.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.880]   So then change your nap protocol and move it earlier.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.420]   So now you've switched off your standard protocol
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.060]   and you've moved on to something different.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.180]   So you're on your standard protocol and then you come off it
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:49.420]   and when you come off it, meaning you go to an earlier nap
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.180]   and you say, gosh, things do seem to be better.
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:55.320]   Maybe he had something there and it just seemed to improve.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.260]   Good, but I don't trust that
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.180]   because maybe it's just a placebo effect
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:04.160]   that you hear some dulcet British tones
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.360]   and you get convinced that maybe that would work
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:11.360]   and now instead, after about two weeks of doing that
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.860]   and things have improved, go back to your original schedule,
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.860]   go back on to your original protocol.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.700]   I'm not as interested about the fact
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.340]   that things got better when we changed it.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.980]   I'm interested in the question,
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.140]   do things get worse when we stop it?
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.140]   And so when we stop the intervention,
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.500]   if things got worse again, now I'm believing it a lot more.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.440]   So just as a tip, if you are a self-tinkerer
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.640]   and so you don't have to do that,
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.000]   but if you're idiotic like me and a scientist
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.640]   and you want to do it with the city rigor,
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.600]   that's the way I would suggest doing it.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:45.960]   - I don't think it's idiotic at all.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.080]   I think it's systematic.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.520]   And what you just described is both a negative control
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.120]   and a positive control experiment.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.240]   So you're- - Thank you.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.240]   - You are a scientist- - To add the terms.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.600]   - Through and through.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.940]   Are there any individuals
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.080]   that should absolutely avoid napping?
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.580]   You know, I've heard lore of, you know,
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:08.500]   elderly folks, folks with certain conditions,
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.860]   you know, I can't imagine which,
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.940]   but I'm sure you'll tell us,
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.740]   that for whom napping is harmful to their health.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.060]   - It's a very, I think, interesting question
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.460]   because the strongest evidence comes back to that,
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.620]   which we've mentioned before, which is insomnia.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:31.920]   And really the recommendation there is just avoid naps.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.840]   And what's problematic about insomnia,
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.840]   when you are having such tough times with sleep at night
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.680]   and you are just dragging through the day, it is miserable.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   And I am, you know, I am very protective of my sleep.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.160]   For the most part, I sleep pretty well,
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.040]   but I'm not immune to the vagaries of sleep.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.600]   I've had two bouts of insomnia throughout my life.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.800]   Both have been what we call reactive insomnia,
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.400]   reactive to an event or something happening.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   And I know how just desperate and hungry you are for sleep.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:17.280]   And if it's happening week after week, month after month,
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.120]   I'll just do anything to get sleep when I can.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.440]   And the temptation therefore to nap
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.720]   when you are suffering from insomnia is that much higher.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.480]   And therefore the advice is that much harder to adopt.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.120]   But trust me, that is one of the components
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.080]   that we have in the psychological treatment bucket
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.400]   that we use for insomnia,
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.360]   which is called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.880]   or CBTI for short.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.680]   And you can just look it up or on my own podcast
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.880]   I did a six part series on insomnia.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:53.880]   So I would say try to back away in that circumstance,
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.200]   but you brought up another example, which is in aging.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.640]   There I think the evidence is a little less causal.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.600]   So you have to be more cautious
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.200]   about recommending the absence
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.440]   as I was with insomnia of abstaining from naps.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.720]   But the data has now become quite strong
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:15.720]   that when you get past about 65 years old
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.000]   and you look at napping behavior
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.440]   in large epidemiological studies,
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   and you say, is there a positive benefit in aging for napping
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.320]   or is there no benefit at all?
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.800]   And they looked at that because they thought,
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.080]   well, that perhaps based on the work in healthy adults
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.480]   that I've described, that would be good for older adults.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.920]   Not only did they find that it wasn't good,
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.880]   they found that it was deleterious,
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.680]   that napping in older adults was predictive
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.800]   of worse health outcomes.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.360]   And it also seemed to predict a higher likelihood
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.160]   of early mortality.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.200]   So at this point we're thinking,
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.560]   well, how does that fit with everything
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.520]   you've been telling us?
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.080]   It comes back to this notion of bad sleep at night.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.600]   It's probably not necessarily that napping during the day
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.760]   is bad for older adults.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.360]   It's that the naps reflect a problem
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:18.320]   with the night of sleep for older adults.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.520]   And as we get older,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.080]   something I didn't mention during development
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.200]   was that yes, we get this sort of stable ratio
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.160]   of four to one of one part REM sleep,
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.720]   four parts non-REM in our seven to nine hours.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.160]   And I described these changes in REM early in development.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.520]   I didn't mention two things
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.840]   about non-REM slow wave activity.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.560]   First, as we go into our teenage years
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.000]   and we shift our sort of timing of sleep
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   where we want to go to bed later and wake up later,
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.480]   that's biologically determined.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.440]   It's not teenagers fault.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.240]   Something happens with their deep sleep.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.240]   However, their deep sleep starts to do a different
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.640]   or different action to the brain
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   that REM sleep was doing as an infant.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.480]   I said that during infancy,
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.360]   we have huge amounts of REM sleep
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.560]   and we're growing synapses, synaptogenesis,
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.160]   and we're wiring up all of those new territories,
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.920]   all of these new neighborhoods with fiber optic cable.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.240]   But let's say that you've now run the experiment
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:20.000]   across many years through until teenagehood
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.160]   of those neighborhoods.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.440]   And you've been measuring the bandwidth consumption
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.840]   of each individual house.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.960]   And you've started to realize,
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.760]   well, I wanted to create a big spread across the brain.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.680]   And then I'm just going to let experience
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.440]   over the next year's time,
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.760]   tell me which parts of the brain
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.920]   seem to enjoy that high bandwidth
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.640]   and which parts don't seem to use it very much.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.080]   And as we go through into our teenage years,
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.080]   we go through something called synaptic pruning
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.800]   where the brain actually culls and takes away synapses
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.720]   from certain parts of the brain.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.400]   It seems to be that this change in slow wave sleep
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.120]   that happens around these adolescent years
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:04.880]   is performing the act of final cortical maturation
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.520]   that it's downscaling the synapses
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.480]   and fine tuning the brain.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.840]   So you've got this beautiful efficiency
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.040]   and now you've throttled back some of the bandwidth
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.920]   from some of those neighborhoods
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.880]   because they just don't use it very much.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.840]   And you can move it over into the territories
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.040]   that are demanding more bandwidth
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.000]   and net, net, the brain is downscaled,
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.120]   but it's improved its efficiency
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.400]   in the sense that those regions that need it
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.960]   and are working hard based on what we think
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.920]   this organism has been doing over the past 13 years,
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.520]   that's where we need to now place our bets.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.800]   But as we get through into our older years,
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.600]   and this will come back to this issue of napping,
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.640]   don't worry, stick with me here, folks.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.520]   The reason is that as we're getting older,
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.520]   our sleep declines, but it's not just all sleep declines.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:03.360]   Deep sleep declines most dramatically.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.680]   And we all think of aging from brain perspective
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.680]   as cognitive decline that our learning
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.280]   and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.920]   And they do.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.240]   But I would argue that a physiological signature of aging
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.720]   is that your sleep gets worse
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.800]   and particularly your deep sleep.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.400]   What's perhaps concerning for people listening
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.280]   to this right now is that that decline in deep sleep
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.120]   doesn't start happening in your 60s or your 50s
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.800]   or even your 40s.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.320]   We can start to pick up that great sleep decline
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.520]   beginning in your mid to late 30s.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.960]   And then it just decreases.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.360]   And by age 50, you are down to about 50%
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.760]   of the deep non-REM sleep that you were having
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.240]   when you were 17 or 18.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.240]   By age 65 and over, or certainly by age 75,
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.440]   you are down to about just 5% of the deep sleep
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.920]   that you had when you were 17 or 18.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.160]   Just a stunning decline.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.040]   What that means comes back to the first episode.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.760]   We spoke about the four macros of good sleep,
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.640]   quantity, quality, timing, and regularity.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.320]   One of the measures of quality that I described to you
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.160]   was this electrical quality of deep sleep.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.960]   The other measure of quality sleep I spoke about
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.920]   was how consolidated and consistent your sleep is
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.640]   versus how fragmented your sleep is.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.200]   The measure of sleep quality
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.800]   is markedly compromised as we get older.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:36.000]   We're waking up many more times.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.440]   Our sleep is much more fragmented
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.960]   and therefore our sleep efficiency is worse.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.640]   And we've got this huge decline in our deep non-REM sleep.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.200]   So no wonder then when you are awake during the day
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.360]   as an older adult,
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:55.560]   your sleep quality is so compromised at that stage,
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.400]   you perhaps try to compensate by way of napping.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.440]   But that compromised quality of sleep
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.200]   that you're having at night is probably the reason
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.000]   that you start to get sick more,
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.160]   that you have a higher probability of illness and disease
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.040]   and why also you probably have a higher risk
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.120]   of premature mortality.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.680]   So in other words, it's the bad quality of sleep at night
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.240]   that leads to this behavior
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.520]   that we call daytime napping in older adults
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.560]   that seems to indirectly suggest,
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.040]   oh my goodness, it's daytime napping that's bad
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.680]   and that causes these problems
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.280]   when in fact it's that daytime napping is a proxy
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.640]   for the bad sleep that's happening at night.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.200]   And it's really the bad sleep that's happening at night
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.120]   that is more directly related to the health
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.640]   and mortality concerns in older adults.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.400]   So that's why I think right now as a field,
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.920]   I'm still open to evidence that napping for some reason
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   that we just do not understand right now is problematic
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.480]   and does causally predict worse health
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.240]   and a shorter lifespan in older adults.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.400]   I think the best evidence that we have right now
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:09.280]   is that it's actually the bad quality of sleep at night
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.840]   and thus we should not be necessarily jumping
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.520]   to recommendations that all older adults
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.760]   should stop napping.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.120]   I think we need more evidence
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.040]   and I'm open to both sides of that.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.520]   - Let's talk about caffeine.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.520]   I've heard the term, is it Nappuccino?
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.080]   - Yeah.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.480]   - I think it refers to a practice
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.360]   of drinking some caffeine, then laying down for a nap
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.040]   and then supposedly waking up, feeling more refreshed.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.120]   My understanding, and you'll tell us more of course,
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.040]   is that caffeine is effectively an adenosine antagonist,
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.440]   although it's a competitive agonist.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.840]   You'll explain, I'm sure.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.120]   And napping, as you mentioned before,
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.640]   removes some of the sleep pressure,
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:58.640]   AKA wipes away some of that adenosine that's accumulated.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.200]   Both of which sound great, but as you mentioned earlier,
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.120]   there's a warning there as well.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.880]   The warning label on both those things should be
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.120]   that having sufficient adenosine built up in your brain
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.560]   is one of the ways in which you feel sleepy at night
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.840]   and fall asleep and stay asleep.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.760]   So what's the story with caffeine?
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.600]   How does it work to make us feel more alert?
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:28.600]   And what is the rationale for the napping?
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.080]   - The nappuccino.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.520]   - The nappuccino, also known as the caffeine nap.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.840]   Caffeine is a very interesting compound
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.320]   in relationship to sleep and wake.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.280]   Obviously everyone knows that caffeine
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.680]   can help you stay awake.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.680]   It's no coincidence that those two words that you've used
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.080]   about these chemical compounds,
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.840]   caffeine and adenosine sound the same.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:57.200]   It's because the receptor that, or the receptor systems
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.680]   that caffeine targets in your brain
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.040]   are the adenosine receptors.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.160]   And you think, well, Matt was telling me
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.880]   that the more adenosine that builds up,
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.840]   in other words, the more adenosine that's latching
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:13.400]   onto those adenosine receptors in your brain,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.960]   the sleepier that you feel.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.280]   And I'm telling you that caffeine works
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.480]   on those same receptors.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.160]   That doesn't make sense.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.360]   Caffeine, if it's working on those same receptors,
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.040]   should increase your sleepiness.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.880]   It doesn't because when it binds
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.760]   onto those adenosine receptors,
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.240]   those welcome sites in the brain,
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.120]   it simply blocks them.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:40.200]   It doesn't deactivate them, nor does it activate them.
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.480]   It simply blocks them.
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:46.280]   So think about it almost a little bit like a room
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.360]   that's full of chairs.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.240]   And at some point, these adenosine,
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.880]   which is one collection of people
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.800]   with the name badges of adenosine,
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.160]   they would normally like to come in
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.640]   and start sitting down on those seats,
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.800]   which are the adenosine receptors.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.800]   And as they sit down on those seats,
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:06.160]   you're building up this signal of sleepiness.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.320]   Well, caffeine, which is another group of people
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:12.040]   with caffeine badges, they race into the room
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.080]   and they start to hijack the seats
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.960]   and they start to sit down on them.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.680]   And all of a sudden, adenosine can't find any seats
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.360]   to sit on.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.600]   So your brain is still flooding that room
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.160]   with adenosine.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.960]   So the adenosine is still building up,
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.200]   but the reason that you don't feel sleepy anymore
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.920]   when you've had a shot of caffeine
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.000]   is because caffeine has raced in,
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.960]   it's latched onto the receptors,
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.480]   and it has essentially hit the mute button
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.800]   on your sleepiness.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.480]   So now your brain was thinking,
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.920]   "Gosh, I've been awake for about 13 or 14 hours.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.000]   "I'm starting to feel it.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.280]   "I'm just gonna take a quick espresso shot."
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.800]   And you get that, you think,
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.920]   "Well, hang on a second, 20, 30 minutes later,
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.960]   "I don't feel as tired anymore."
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.800]   Why?
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.000]   It's not because caffeine came in
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.160]   and removed the adenosine, it didn't.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.040]   Caffeine has come in, blocked the sites,
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.120]   but the adenosine is still building up.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:19.000]   And then at some point, the caffeine wears off.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.800]   And therefore, not only do you go back
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.520]   to the same level of adenosine
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.040]   that you did two hours ago,
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.560]   it's that plus the additional two hours of adenosine
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.200]   that has been building up.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.520]   And what you experience is something called a caffeine crash.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.960]   And now you need even more caffeine,
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.160]   not just to get you back to where you were,
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.040]   but to recover the crash that you've had and go further.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.400]   Caffeine in relationship to the caffeine nap,
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.640]   though the nappuccino is relevant because of its timing.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.360]   Caffeine has an instigating action
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:01.360]   of around 12, 14 to 17 minutes.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.560]   So when you come through in the morning
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.440]   and you grab your first cup of coffee,
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:10.520]   and within the first four or five minutes,
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.680]   you say, "I just feel better.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.920]   "I've just had a couple of sips.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.120]   "I've had half a cup of coffee and I already feel better.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.760]   "I just needed that."
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.560]   If it's within the first five minutes
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.920]   that you're experiencing that,
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.000]   it's got nothing to do with the caffeine
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.840]   because the peak plasma concentration of your caffeine
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.760]   is not going to arrive with you
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.160]   until about 12 to 17 minutes.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.640]   So why do you feel better?
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.160]   Some of it is placebo 'cause you're smelling the coffee
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.880]   and you associate it with alertness.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.360]   It's really not that though.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.120]   - Or when you say placebo,
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.160]   I also wonder whether or not
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.480]   it's possibly a conditioned effect,
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.760]   like a Pavlovian thing,
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.680]   because the smell of the coffee, the taste of the coffee,
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.160]   the hum of the machine, the walking into the cafe
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.000]   and ordering it from the barista
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.480]   also creates an anticipatory arousal.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.720]   Like the alertness is coming.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.200]   And in that anticipation,
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.200]   there's its own form of alertness.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.440]   - I think that's certainly a big component of it.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.040]   The other component, however, if you look at the data
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.880]   is that it's got nothing to do with the caffeine
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.720]   in that moment.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.680]   It's the temperature
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.800]   that most people take their caffeine warm,
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.840]   either it's tea or it's coffee,
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.880]   or it's perhaps something else
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.320]   that Andrew Huberman would drink.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.160]   But many people--
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.680]   - Yerba mate.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.080]   Since I was five years old,
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.680]   I don't know if I should have been drinking
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.640]   caffeinated yerba mate so young,
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.720]   maybe even four years old.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:34.280]   There's a photo of me on my grandfather's lap
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.640]   drinking out of the mate gourd.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.160]   Half my family's Argentine.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.320]   And so I was caffeinated from a young age.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.880]   This brain developed in a caffeinated milieu.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.960]   - This explains so much about what I've known of you
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:46.800]   over these years.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.640]   No, I'm kidding you.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.760]   But we need to speak later, no.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:55.760]   So what's interesting about that is it's the temperature.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:59.000]   And I told you in the first episode
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.680]   that we need to cool down to stay asleep,
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.480]   but we need to initially warm up to fall asleep
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.840]   because warming up at that moment I was telling you
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.160]   is warming up at the periphery.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.240]   - Warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.840]   - So you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.400]   Then you need to stay cool to stay asleep.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.400]   And then you need to warm up to wake up.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.840]   The warming up to cool down to fall asleep
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.200]   is not warming up in the middle deeps core of your body.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.560]   It's about warming up the hands and the feet
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.000]   and the head to dissipate the heat.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.200]   Hence warm up the outer surfaces
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.360]   to cool down the inner core to fall asleep.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.160]   But then I told you, you have to warm up to wake up.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:48.160]   And when we take a hot drink in the morning,
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.040]   usually caffeinated,
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.640]   the change in your core body temperature
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.280]   can happen within a handful of minutes.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.480]   So the initial benefit that you get
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:02.160]   from the hot cup of coffee in the morning or hot tea
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.800]   is from the temperature rise.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.320]   And then you get this beautiful second kick
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.320]   from the caffeine itself.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.560]   And that caffeine can then sustain
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.000]   for a longer period of time.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.320]   So we mentioned this problem with napping
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.880]   that even at 25 or 30 minutes of a nap,
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.360]   you wake up with that kind of grogginess,
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.320]   that sleep inertia.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.800]   And what, however, if I could give you the benefits
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.200]   of a nap and have you come out of the nap
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.200]   with zero sleep inertia.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.240]   And that's what some folks started to cleverly think about.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.960]   What if I could look at the timing of the optimal nap,
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.160]   maybe 20 minutes,
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.440]   and think about the timing
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:53.360]   of when peak plasma concentration of caffeine emerges.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.560]   And I told you, it really starts to kick into gear
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.280]   around 17 minutes and it's in full swing by 20.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.320]   What if I was creative?
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.000]   I'm going to withhold from saying idiotic enough,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.040]   but creative enough to get into bed
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.840]   just before I turn the light out for my nap
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.240]   in the afternoon.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.320]   I swig a quick espresso, light goes off.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.400]   I close my eyes, I mask earplugs,
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.600]   and I'm going to drift off fine
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.560]   because the caffeine is not gonna kick in
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.120]   for another 17, 20 minutes, perhaps it's full threshold.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.960]   So now you fall into sleep
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.720]   and you're going down into sleep.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.320]   And if you perhaps don't make it too large
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.360]   in terms of its serving,
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.440]   the temperature change is not going to affect you
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.480]   in a negative way.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:44.600]   And then just as your alarm clock
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.320]   is about to go off after 20 minutes,
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.600]   you're on the beautiful ascending swing
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.040]   of upward plasma concentration of caffeine
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.840]   and you get ejected out the other side
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.520]   with both the benefits of the nap
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:01.120]   together with the benefits of the caffeine.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:04.200]   So you get your cake and you can eat it too.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.760]   You get the nap absent the sleep inertia.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.520]   And hence this created what we call the caffeine nap.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.320]   - I love it.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.160]   - The nappuccino.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.160]   - The nappuccino.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.760]   Maybe I'll give it a try.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.680]   This is the first time I've ever heard the rationale
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.280]   and the fine structure of the nappuccino,
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.200]   but it makes sense at a logical and mechanistic level.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.040]   - I have to ask,
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.720]   is there anything besides caffeine and sleep
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.320]   that can clear adenosine?
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.160]   Can exercise clear adenosine?
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.760]   Can a cold shower clear adenosine?
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.800]   I mean, and I understand
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.920]   that there are a bunch of competing mechanisms in the body,
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.200]   like presumably a spike in norepinephrine or adrenaline
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.040]   or both is going to impact the adenosine system.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.280]   I once heard a great quote from a former
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.360]   member of the National Academy of Sciences,
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.320]   a brilliant guy.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.640]   He said, you know,
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.320]   a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.280]   or a human produces a scientific publication,
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.240]   meaning it is rare to find a paper
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.560]   that doesn't see some effect of some drug,
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:15.400]   especially on sleep, I'm told.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.840]   As I recall, if you put aspirin REM sleep into PubMed,
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.280]   you're going to see some effect on REM sleep
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.360]   from people who take aspirin.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.000]   Pretty much any substance that one takes
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.800]   is going to alter some feature of sleep
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.040]   or of wakeful states.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.320]   If one is looking with a fine enough instrument,
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.400]   or is that an overstatement?
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.120]   - No, I don't think it is an overstatement.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.560]   And it comes back to the first episode
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.280]   where we described the complexity,
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.640]   this incredible, beautiful physiological ballet.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.080]   Certainly one of the recommendations
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.040]   when people say I get this afternoon,
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.640]   this postprandial drop in my alertness, what can I do?
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.120]   I can say you could nap.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.440]   But another way is just get outside and walk around,
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.160]   be physically active.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.560]   Some of that has to do with the fact
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.840]   that you'll probably get some daylight
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.880]   and daylight can be a stimulator of alertness
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.640]   as long you've told us and educated us on.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.560]   We also know that physical activity by itself
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.240]   can increase the amount of endorphins and dynorphins
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.920]   and those are wake promoting.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.280]   But none of those are really necessarily
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.120]   going to be altering adenosine.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.560]   They're simply overriding the adenosine
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.040]   that is still building up.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.200]   It really does seem to be for the most part,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.560]   at least as all that I know,
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.280]   it's only sleep and particularly non-REM sleep
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.160]   that has the capacity to or give the brain the chance
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.720]   to remove that adenosine.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.720]   Now, what could be interesting, I think,
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:40.280]   is two circumstances.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.360]   One is where your brain becomes less metabolically active
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.760]   for another reason.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.600]   And I told you that it's not as though
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.200]   during deep non-REM sleep
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.240]   that there is some special pulsing cleansing mechanism
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.760]   for adenosine.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.400]   There is a cleansing system called the glymphatic system,
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.040]   which removes the toxic metabolic byproducts
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.200]   of the waking day.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.840]   Wakefulness in some ways is biochemically
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.160]   low level brain damage
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:10.480]   and sleep is sanitary salvation in that regard.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.720]   - I knew it, I knew it.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.680]   - But which is, again, it's hubristic
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.240]   and it's going too far, but it makes a point.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.480]   The idea here, however, is that it's not
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.880]   that there is a special system
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.400]   that is removing the adenosine during deep non-REM sleep.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   It's just that your brain is less metabolically active
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.760]   and therefore it's not producing as much adenosine.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.400]   So the natural mechanisms that are always occurring
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.920]   in the background to be clearing adenosine
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:39.120]   and degrading it, simply get the chance to do that
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.040]   just as effectively as they have,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.320]   but you're no longer working against the opposite tide
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.360]   that is growing the adenosine.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:52.320]   Now, the adenosine increase has dissipated
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.560]   because you're no longer metabolically active
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.840]   during deep sleep and you get the chance to cleanse it.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.360]   All of which is to say, therefore, that,
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.280]   and I think that would mimic that,
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.880]   such as, for example, anesthesia.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.360]   My guess is that you probably do jettison
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.880]   some sleep pressure when you are in anesthesia.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:14.160]   I also think that these liminal states,
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.040]   non-sleep deep rest could be a fascinating territory there.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.200]   Because at that point, I'm going to guess,
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.840]   and we'll be able to see with the EEG,
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.040]   and we may also be able to do some imaging,
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.360]   depending on how you and I designed the study,
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.120]   to look at what changes in the brain
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.800]   in terms of its activation state.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.520]   My guess is that if it does put you into something
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.080]   like slow wave activity patterns,
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.440]   that means that those territories of the brain
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.720]   are metabolically less active.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.280]   And that allows the brain to dissipate the adenosine.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.120]   So to your point, I don't think things
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.520]   like necessarily exercise or light change adenosine levels.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.720]   They do give a nice alertness benefit for the reasons.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:00.920]   But is there an alternative way of dissipating adenosine?
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.520]   Yes, I think anything that mimics a non
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:06.320]   or a less metabolically active brain
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.000]   could produce these beautiful adenosine benefits.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.080]   - Thank you for that.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.920]   This brings me to a question
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.640]   about the period immediately after waking
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.160]   from the nightly bout of sleep.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:23.280]   I've been touting the benefits
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.000]   of delaying one's caffeine intake
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.640]   by 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.440]   There's a little bit of a misconception out there.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.320]   I think people ran with the ball,
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.120]   assuming that I was mandating this
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.480]   or suggesting that everyone should do this.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.000]   And that's simply not the case.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.680]   I actually wake up and I'll hydrate
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.840]   and drink caffeine very close to waking
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.840]   if I'm going to exercise soon after, which I often do.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.160]   But I've experienced, and I know others have experienced
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.960]   if they are not going to exercise immediately
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.160]   or they don't need caffeine to exercise for whatever reason,
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.920]   I've heard these people exist, I'm no such mutant,
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.680]   that delaying their caffeine intake by 90 to 120 minutes
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.340]   in some cases can offset the afternoon crash.
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:09.560]   Now, I want to be clear, some of that
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.260]   may be offsetting the afternoon consumption of more caffeine
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.360]   because by delaying your caffeine intake in the morning,
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.320]   then perhaps there's less of an incentive
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.180]   or requirement to drink caffeine in the afternoon.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:21.640]   And all of which dominoes to,
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.280]   as we'll talk about more in this series,
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:25.440]   to better sleep at night
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.060]   because you're not ingesting caffeine close to bedtime.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.480]   But at risk of taking a massive tangent,
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.760]   here's what I'd like to know
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.600]   based on what you just told us.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:39.860]   If indeed sleep and lower metabolic activity
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.900]   in certain brain regions
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:47.340]   can help reduce adenosine levels in the brain,
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:50.960]   one could imagine that upon waking,
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.640]   it is either a step function from, okay,
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.520]   let's say at 5.45 AM, somebody is asleep
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.200]   and adenosine is still being cleared away
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.200]   because they're asleep.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.680]   And then they wake up, boom,
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.940]   does adenosine clearance immediately stop?
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:09.740]   Well, for people who have that crumpled face grogginess
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.900]   and they wake up at 5.45, maybe even by way of alarm,
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:15.060]   although we don't suggest that, right?
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:17.980]   And they stagger into the kitchen
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.900]   and ordinarily they'd make their cup of coffee,
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:23.300]   but they're in a pseudo sleep state.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.540]   So it stands to reason
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.060]   that they're still clearing adenosine.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.720]   Now, if they are to drink caffeine right away,
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.500]   then they're, as you pointed out,
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.160]   going to block those adenosine receptors
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.300]   and there's going to be a continued buildup of adenosine
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.500]   as opposed to a clearance of adenosine.
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:39.360]   So this was part, not the entire reason,
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.060]   but part of the rationale for suggesting
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:44.300]   that people at least explore delaying caffeine slightly.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.060]   And then there are things like the cortisol rise
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.100]   and et cetera.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:51.180]   But does that kind of framework at least make logical sense?
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.380]   That doesn't mean it would hold up
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:53.600]   in a randomized controlled trial,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.820]   but given that we're talking about
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:57.620]   essentially zero risk protocols here,
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.220]   what are your thoughts on that?
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:02.320]   - I think it is good advice for people to test.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.120]   And it's good advice for two reasons.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.520]   The first is that which you describe
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.880]   in some ways by taking caffeine on early
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:13.440]   and masking that adenosine.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.760]   Also caffeine can make your brain more metabolically active,
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.080]   which means that you're going to build up
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.320]   more adenosine during the day,
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.760]   which means that sleepiness is going to arrive earlier,
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.280]   which means that perhaps that postprandial drop
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.680]   is going to be harsher
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.380]   and you're going to perhaps then need to self-medicate
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:32.140]   with more caffeine and so goes the vicious cycle.
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:34.260]   So I think that's one thing to keep in mind.
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:35.680]   I think that's one hypothesis.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.540]   I think the second hypothesis for me
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:39.740]   or the second reason I would advocate for that
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:42.380]   is if you've been using caffeine that way
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:44.060]   for a long period of time,
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:49.060]   you may also be masking the quality of your sleep
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:51.340]   because you wake up,
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.340]   you immediately medicate with caffeine
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:57.020]   and you are alert, you're awake,
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:00.500]   and you think, well, looking back on my night,
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.980]   I'm awake now after my caffeine.
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.980]   And now is the important part of that sentence.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:06.300]   I'm awake now.
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.140]   So there's nothing wrong with my sleep.
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.060]   Is that true?
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:11.980]   Maybe it is, maybe it's not.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:14.580]   Maybe if you abstain from caffeine through
[01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:17.140]   and you have to get through the detox period,
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:20.020]   it's not going to, this is not the right test immediately,
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.420]   but do it for about two weeks.
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:23.340]   And then at that point,
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:26.060]   once you're free from the detox and the withdrawal,
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:28.540]   now you're in a somewhat naive state
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:29.860]   where you're taking your caffeine on,
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.540]   I'm not telling you to stop caffeine,
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:33.660]   you're taking it on at 11 o'clock
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.460]   after you've woken up at let's say seven o'clock
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.540]   in the morning.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:39.660]   At that point, we've now got this nice clear window
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.180]   that has been consistently happening
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:44.460]   between seven to 11 in the morning.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:46.020]   And I'm going to ask you now,
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:48.980]   do you feel rested, restored, and refreshed?
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:53.980]   And can you operate with cognitive acumen and skill
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:56.940]   in those first morning hours?
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:59.100]   Now, don't forget, we've got to get past
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:01.900]   the natural sleep inertia period in the first 90 minutes.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:03.940]   But after the first 90 minutes of waking up
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:08.180]   absent of caffeine, let's say by 9 a.m. in the morning,
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.220]   are you functioning well?
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:12.660]   Because if you're not, and you still think,
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.060]   you know what, I don't feel restored by my sleep,
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.980]   I feel unrefreshed.
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.820]   I want to then start asking you,
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.300]   let's take a look at your sleep
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:23.540]   and let's see how we can get you to a more refreshed state.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:26.380]   And by using caffeine first thing in the morning,
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.980]   you don't give yourself the chance to test
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.100]   whether or not subjectively you sense
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:33.700]   your sleep is good quality.
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.980]   Now, you don't need to do this forever,
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:38.420]   you can just do a test for a month
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:40.100]   and be asking that question.
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.100]   And if all is clear, after you've got through withdrawal
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.620]   and you've got past the first 90 minutes after waking up,
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:48.820]   and you tell me, now in this more caffeine naive state
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:52.020]   in the first few hours, I feel rest, I feel refreshed,
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.620]   I feel restored by my sleep, then that's great.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:57.660]   We don't need to be concerned about your sleep.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:59.580]   So that's the second reason I like it
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.700]   because it gives you the opportunity
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:04.100]   to test out whether or not your sleep
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.660]   is of good quality or not.
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.780]   I should also note, by the way,
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:11.900]   that I mentioned I've changed my mind on caffeine
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.340]   and its use, and this comes back to,
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.780]   I just raise it because you had said,
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:20.940]   I made this suggestion and it wasn't binary,
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.020]   it wasn't dictatorial, you don't have to do it.
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:24.780]   I wasn't saying that everyone needs to do it.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.140]   And in fact, even I will tweak my schedule
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:29.700]   if I'm doing one thing in the morning,
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.580]   I will take on board caffeine fairly soon.
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.660]   If I'm not, I will hold off.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:39.700]   I came out the gate when I first published a book
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:44.700]   and I was very dictatorial about it.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:49.260]   And I was very monoist, I was very binary.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.580]   It was sleep is absolute
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:56.260]   and it has to be this way and no other way.
[01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:59.020]   I was not in favor of caffeine
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:00.580]   and I was telling people about the dangers
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.300]   and there are dangers to your sleep
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.740]   and we can speak about those,
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:06.820]   but it was a little bit too heavy handed.
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:10.300]   I've changed my mind for at least two reasons.
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:15.300]   First, that's not the way society works or people live.
[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.580]   So there's no amount just like technology
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:20.860]   and saying leave your phone outside of the room
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.180]   for two hours before bed
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:24.340]   and don't check it for the first four hours.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:26.140]   That genie is out of the bottle.
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:29.020]   So the reason I have changed my mind on caffeine
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:34.020]   is because if you look at the data on caffeine,
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:36.060]   it's stunning for health.
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:41.100]   On almost every metric that we can measure,
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.980]   drinking some degree of caffeine is beneficial.
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:48.580]   Now, there is a U-shaped function to this,
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.940]   which is once you get past sort of three or four cups
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:54.260]   of coffee, then you start to go in the downward direction
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.500]   and things aren't so great.
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:01.500]   The contradiction, however, was that I was telling people
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.340]   caffeine, not good for your sleep
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:06.460]   and sleep, by the way, is wonderful for health.
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.700]   It transacts all of these benefits that we have
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:11.580]   and we'll discuss in this series.
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.380]   But then you compare that relative to caffeine
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:19.940]   and caffeine transacts many of the same health benefits.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:24.380]   So how can you explain that, Mr. Sleep Scientist?
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:28.380]   Well, if you look, the data is very clear.
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:30.860]   It's not the caffeine that's the benefit.
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:33.020]   Most people take on board caffeine
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:35.820]   by way of a cup of coffee.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:40.820]   And the coffee bean is packed full, not just of caffeine,
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:45.340]   it contains a whopping dose of antioxidants.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:49.220]   And because of our deficient Western diets,
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.020]   we're so absent of these antioxidants
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:58.500]   that the humble cup of coffee has been asked
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.220]   to carry the Herculean weight
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:04.580]   of our antioxidant needs on its shoulders.
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:07.260]   So no wonder it by itself carries
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.220]   such a strong health signal
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:12.580]   because it's providing you with this wonderful dose
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:16.060]   of antioxidants in addition to caffeine.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.580]   Case in point, if you look at decaffeinated coffee,
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:22.100]   you still get the antioxidants,
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:23.980]   but now you don't get the caffeine
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:27.340]   and lo and behold, you get many of the same health benefits.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:30.140]   It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee itself.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:35.140]   So I think that is a perfectly good reason
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:38.180]   to justify caffeine, but again, just like naps,
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.860]   the dose and the timing make the poison.
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:43.300]   If you're not someone who's sensitive to caffeine,
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.060]   then having a couple of cups of caffeine
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:49.060]   and trying to step away from the use of caffeine,
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:52.420]   I would argue somewhere between 10 to 12 hours
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.300]   before you expect to go to bed,
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.180]   depending on your sensitivity.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.940]   And it is different across people
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.860]   and we know that it's genetic.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.540]   There is a specific, what we call polymorphism,
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:06.900]   which just means a variation in a particular gene.
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:09.620]   And if you look at variations in that,
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.220]   it will predict whether you are someone
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:13.340]   who is very sensitive to caffeine
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:16.300]   or not very sensitive to caffeine.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:19.420]   And it comes down to how quickly you can essentially
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:23.460]   metabolically remove that caffeine from the system.
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.540]   So if you know that you're a very sensitive person,
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.020]   I would probably argue,
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:30.460]   try to steer clear maybe 12 to 14 hours.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:33.580]   If you're someone who is not as sensitive,
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:35.660]   then you could maybe go to eight hours.
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:38.180]   The danger is for people who say,
[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:40.740]   look, I'm one of those people who is,
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:44.060]   really just not sensitive to caffeine at all.
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:47.020]   And I can have an espresso with dinner
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:50.140]   and I fall asleep fine, I stay asleep fine.
[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.860]   So it's really not a problem for me.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:54.700]   I would say that that may be true,
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:56.420]   but the inherent danger here is that
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.580]   and we've done these studies.
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:00.340]   If I give you a dose of let's say 200, 300,
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:03.700]   400 milligrams of caffeine in the hours before bed,
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:07.300]   which would be a large, strong cup of coffee
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.700]   or two espressos with dinner.
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:13.340]   Some people can fall asleep and some people stay asleep,
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:17.340]   but the amount of deep sleep that they have is compromised.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:20.980]   In fact, it can drop your deep sleep by up to 20%.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.220]   Now the danger is that you wake up in the morning
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:26.980]   and there was no signals in your sleep
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.460]   that said you had problematic sleep
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:31.860]   because you're not aware of how much deep sleep that you had.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:33.900]   That's the reason that I think sleep trackers
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.380]   can be helpful in some ways.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:41.140]   But you then wake up and you don't feel as refreshed
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.540]   and restored, but you don't remember having a hard time
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:44.980]   falling asleep or staying asleep.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.700]   But now you find yourself reaching for three cups of coffee
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:50.220]   to wake up in the morning rather than the standard two.
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.060]   And so goes the vicious cycle.
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:56.300]   So, and also you see an interesting interrelationship.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:58.060]   We did a recent study we just published
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:00.300]   in Wall Street Traders.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:01.540]   It's not just caffeine use,
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:04.180]   it's also about alcohol use in the evening.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:08.100]   That people who over-medicate with caffeine during the day,
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:11.700]   they then need something to bring them down at night.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:14.980]   And the principal depressant agent,
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:18.740]   and depressant not in the sense of psychiatric depression,
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:22.220]   but in the sense of brain neural activity depression,
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:23.500]   is alcohol.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.940]   So you get this classic cycle of uppers and downers.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:29.500]   I need my uppers during the morning, my caffeine,
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:33.700]   and I need my downers at night to lull me into sleep.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:36.260]   And it's this really interesting trade-off
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:39.740]   which we saw in these Wall Street Traders.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:42.860]   So coming back to the notion of caffeine though,
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:47.220]   I am favorable of it in terms of its health benefits.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:49.180]   I think it's very, very clear.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:51.020]   Just be mindful of the dose
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:53.140]   and be mindful of the timing.
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:56.940]   Dose, try to not exceed about three cups of coffee.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.100]   Timing, understand your sensitivity.
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:00.260]   There are certain genetic tests
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:01.500]   if you really want to get nerdy
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.700]   that will tell you if you have this sensitivity or not,
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:06.540]   but you will probably know it.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:09.100]   And therefore just say, okay, I'm not that sensitive.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:10.900]   I could probably go eight hours
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:14.100]   or as close as eight hours before sleep or 10 hours.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.100]   If you're very sensitive, 14, 15 hours
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.180]   and keep it to one cup.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:23.340]   So those are the ways that I would see moderating caffeine
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.020]   and changing my mind on caffeine,
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:28.460]   which just comes back to your point where you were saying,
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:31.100]   look, I made this recommendation about caffeine.
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.260]   I want to make sure I modify that
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:35.060]   so people don't get confused.
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:38.860]   I certainly needed to make a modification
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.260]   to my stance on caffeine.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:41.540]   So thank you for letting me say that,
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:44.740]   which is a long-winded way of getting around it.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.420]   But does that help a little bit?
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:48.580]   - That does help very much.
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:52.020]   Thank you for that addendum to the legislature.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:57.500]   Okay, so you told us about the power nap
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.460]   and you've told us about the caffeine nap,
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:02.580]   the so-called Nappuccino.
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.420]   - Yeah.
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.780]   - What are some other types of naps
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:08.420]   that can be beneficial for sleep-wake cycles and alertness?
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:12.300]   - So you can think about the caffeine nap
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:17.300]   as trying to amplify it as sort of a nap plus as it were,
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:21.580]   but to your question, the study that comes to mind,
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:24.100]   there was a brilliant investigation,
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:27.180]   Herculean in its study design
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:30.420]   from a great sleep research group out in Japan.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:33.940]   And they asked, okay, the nap is good.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:36.780]   The caffeine nap may be a little bit better,
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:38.460]   but can we go further?
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:43.460]   And so they designed a series of studies.
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:46.340]   They had five different experimental groups
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.700]   and they tried to basically create a stack,
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:50.420]   a stacking system.
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:52.540]   They had across the five groups,
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:55.180]   there was a no-nap group, that's the control.
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:56.700]   Then there was a nap group.
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.700]   Then there was a nap plus caffeine group.
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:03.220]   Then there was a nap plus cold face
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:07.820]   and cold hand-washing immediately after you wake up.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:11.060]   And I'll come back to explain why that we think that works.
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:12.820]   And then the final group was a group
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:16.580]   that was a nap plus bright light.
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:20.860]   And again, thank you, me offering this as the general public
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.820]   to you, Andrew Huberman, for your light revolution.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:28.820]   So it was bright light at 2000 lux immediately afterwards.
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.380]   So they had five groups.
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.100]   Again, there was no-nap group, nap group, nap plus caffeine,
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:36.380]   nap plus cold hands and face-washing,
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:38.940]   nap plus immediate bright light.
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.540]   The cold hands and face-washing is interesting.
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:44.780]   I told you before that there was this three-part story
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:47.180]   to the sleep-wake equation,
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:49.420]   that you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep,
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:52.260]   stay cool to stay asleep, warm up to wake up.
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.020]   And I'm saying warm up to wake up,
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:58.140]   but use cold water on your face and your hands.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:02.260]   Don't forget that warming up, when I say it in the morning,
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:05.500]   is warming up at the central core of your body.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.420]   You reverse engineer what you did in the evening.
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:11.380]   I said, warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:13.460]   So you warm up the periphery
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:16.500]   to release the blood from the core and you cool down.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.820]   Well, the reason that they use cold hand and face-washing
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:23.220]   was because that's this vascular surface.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:25.580]   It's the place where we can modulate temperature
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:26.900]   quite quickly.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:29.820]   The cold water on the face and the hands
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:33.260]   therefore caused a vasoconstriction.
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:36.180]   The vessels and the capillaries there,
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:39.020]   they all scrunched up and they forced the blood
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:41.580]   back down into the core of the body.
[01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:43.940]   So the core body temperature increased a little bit.
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:46.820]   Now you also get a bit of an adrenaline shot
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.900]   when you're splashing very cold water
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.740]   on your hands and your face.
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:52.900]   So there's some of that too, but that's the justification.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:55.180]   So what they find, firstly,
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:58.780]   they were measuring different aspects of your cognition
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:00.380]   and your mood and your sleepiness.
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:02.820]   Those were the outcome measures to assess
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:05.660]   how did these five different experimental groups change?
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:07.420]   And you can imagine, I mean, this is,
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:09.900]   I don't think I would ever take on a study
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:13.820]   where I'm doing five nap groups all within one study.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:15.420]   It's bloody amazing.
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:18.140]   So they did the no-nap group
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:19.900]   and then compared to the no-nap group,
[02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.140]   the nap group got a wonderful benefit
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.980]   just as we described.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:26.860]   And they showed benefits in their alertness,
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.540]   in their cognitive performance,
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.060]   and also they showed a reduction in their sleepiness.
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:36.500]   So point number one on the scoreboard for a nap.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:38.900]   Then they did the nap plus the caffeine.
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.860]   And sure enough, you got an added benefit
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:46.140]   to that which you already obtained from the nap.
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:48.540]   Now it was nowhere near as sizable
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:49.780]   as the benefit from the nap.
[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:53.660]   So the addition of caffeine does give you some nice benefits
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:54.620]   and I've used this before
[02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:56.740]   when I've worked with sort of professional athletes,
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:01.740]   we do instigate these nap, these caffeine naps when needed.
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:04.220]   So it did give a nice benefit.
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.660]   But then when they looked at the nap
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.140]   plus cold hand and face washing
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:11.820]   and the nap plus the bright light,
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:15.540]   those also added something to the nap benefit.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:17.500]   Now they didn't do the sixth group,
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:20.620]   which is really what I'm going to do some hand-waving about,
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:23.660]   which is the full stack, full fat method,
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:26.700]   where they said, okay, you're gonna do nap plus caffeine
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:29.660]   plus cold hand and face washing plus bright light.
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.820]   But if you were to put those together,
[02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:35.460]   my thought is that they're probably additive
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:40.180]   rather than simply just, you know, netting each other out,
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:43.500]   which means that if you really want to not just do a nap
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:46.700]   or a nap plus, which would be the caffeine nap,
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:51.180]   but the nap plus plus version, you can lean into this study.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:55.220]   And the protocol there would be, you get into bed,
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:58.260]   you have your espresso shot before you turn the light,
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:01.340]   you swig it, go down, set your alarm for 20 minutes,
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.460]   you wake up, the caffeine is kicking in,
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:06.580]   you get over the inertia, you go straight out,
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:10.700]   cold hands, cold face by way of cold water,
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:12.980]   and then you get immediate daylight
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.980]   for five to 10 minutes outside.
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:19.020]   And at that point, you're really in a supercharged state.
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:22.420]   So that's if you, just because I know
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:24.300]   there's probably gonna be some audience members
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.940]   who are willing to give this a try
[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:28.940]   or who really want to optimize.
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.420]   Don't give me, you know, what is good,
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:33.860]   give me the extreme very best.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:36.780]   That's the only suggestion I would have based on that data.
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:37.620]   - I love it.
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:39.140]   And actually what you just described
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:44.020]   could easily be translocated to the period
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:47.740]   after waking from the nightly bout of sleep,
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:50.700]   although one wouldn't ingest caffeine
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.160]   prior to waking up for obvious reasons,
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.940]   but it would make good sense to me to wake up,
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.980]   obviously get sunlight in one's eyes,
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:01.320]   splash some cold water in one's face or hands,
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:05.780]   or get cold shower, cold plunge, caffeine or delay caffeine.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:09.060]   I mean, it's essentially the same set of tools.
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.820]   And I think it really points to the fact
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:14.960]   that circadian rhythm, clearance of adenosine,
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:18.860]   temperature modulation, and of course,
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:20.980]   the way in which these interact
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:25.180]   are really the levers and knobs to modulate wakefulness.
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:28.500]   - Yeah, so there are,
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:31.020]   I think we've gone over this notion of naps,
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.100]   but there are ways that you can try
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:36.100]   to manipulate the nap system still.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:40.620]   And there are ways that you can manipulate it even further.
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:41.700]   But I like what you're saying
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:44.140]   because it just comes back to the fundamentals.
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:47.140]   Let's forego the nap conversation,
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:50.380]   just go back to the morning routine.
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:51.460]   You're absolutely right.
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:54.060]   And think about the cold water and warm water.
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:57.500]   My guess is that very few people, when they go to bed,
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:01.560]   they wash their face and their hands maybe,
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.500]   they're probably not washing it with cold water
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:04.660]   before they go to bed.
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.500]   - Correct.
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.860]   - They're going to be washing it with warm water.
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:07.980]   Why don't they do that?
[02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:09.020]   And they just say, well,
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:10.780]   why would I splash cold water on my face?
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.500]   You know, it probably wakes me up.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.460]   You ever thought about why it wakes you up?
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:18.620]   Part of it is that, you know, the shot of activation,
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:20.900]   but the other part is thermoregulation.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:22.360]   And the opposite is what you want to do.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.660]   If anything, you want to be warming your hands
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:25.500]   and your feet.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.060]   And that's exactly what you've always done.
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:29.580]   You've always medicated your sleep onset
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:33.060]   by using warm water on your face and your hands.
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:35.100]   - Several times during today's discussion,
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.180]   we talked about polyphasic sleep
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:41.660]   and the different types of polyphasic sleep
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.660]   that we covered are, I wouldn't say conventional,
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:46.680]   but they're conventional-ish.
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.980]   What are some of the more esoteric
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:51.520]   or let's call them high-performance
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:55.540]   polyphasic strategies for sleep?
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:57.720]   - So we've spoken about polyphasic sleep
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:02.720]   in the natural way it occurs, which is during infancy.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:05.980]   And sleeping like a baby means that you're sleeping
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.960]   in a highly polyphasic way.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.560]   But probably around about the late 1990s, 2000s,
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:15.720]   with the emergence of the biohacker movement
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.920]   and the quantified self movement,
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:21.200]   there started to become a lot of chatter online
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:24.520]   about this notion of polyphasic sleep.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:27.720]   And here, no longer are we infants, we're now adults,
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:31.900]   but we're engaging in a pattern that is highly polyphasic.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:35.400]   Polyphasic sleep simply by definition,
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.520]   again, means that you're having multiple phases of sleep
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:39.200]   within a 24-hour period.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.040]   And there are different strategies.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.400]   So the way polyphasic sleep in adults works
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:45.080]   is that you take the 24-hour period
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:47.480]   and you think about it like a pie chart.
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:49.980]   And then you start to slice that pie up
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:52.360]   into these quadrants.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:53.680]   When it comes to polyphasic sleep,
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:58.680]   the goal is to put insert multiple phases of sleep
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:01.560]   around the 24-hour clock rather than one single phase.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:06.560]   But the thinness of those slices of the pie are very thin,
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:11.560]   leaving large thick slices of wakefulness in between.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:14.240]   The notion that being that if you were to sort of
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:17.640]   just intersperse little soupçons of sleep
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:20.440]   in terms of these little thin slices of sleep,
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:23.360]   you can increase the amount of time that you're awake
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:27.000]   and you can increase all of the benefits of wake.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.360]   So if you look at the, there is a website,
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:33.720]   I think it's called the Polyphasic Society.
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:36.840]   And there it's not a scientific society,
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.640]   like the psychological,
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:42.680]   the American Association for Psychology
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:46.680]   or American Medical Association or British Medical.
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:48.920]   It's not one of those ratified,
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:50.920]   certified scientific or medical.
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:53.900]   It's just a society that lives online, which is great.
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:58.520]   And they make claims to suggest that polyphasic sleep
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:01.160]   can improve aspects of your mood.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.920]   It can improve aspects of your productivity.
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:06.240]   It can maybe even improve aspects of health.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:09.000]   I think sometimes there are claims that it can help
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.480]   with lifespan.
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:15.000]   And there are a number of different schedules
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.160]   that they will describe to you
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:21.240]   and that you can find out there of polyphasic sleep.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:24.080]   There is the first one that probably people have heard of
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.480]   is called the Uberman schedule.
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:30.020]   And by the way, there is no H at the start of that.
[02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:31.960]   It is simply U.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.920]   I know it's not this man sitting across from me
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.600]   who has anything to do with this schedule.
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.360]   And after we discuss the data,
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:43.000]   he will reassert that very same fact.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.920]   Then there's something called the Everyman schedule.
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.320]   And then there is the Triphasic schedule.
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:51.760]   And there's lots of different other flavors of this.
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:53.840]   The differences between them are
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:55.840]   in how you split up that pie chart
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:58.560]   and how much you assign to little thin slices of sleep
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:00.200]   versus longer periods of wake
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:01.920]   and how many of those you insert,
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.960]   but they all follow the same pattern.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.400]   If you look at the literature, however,
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:09.680]   it didn't begin with the biohacker movement.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:14.680]   The first description I can find in the human record
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:18.760]   comes from Time Magazine, an issue in 1943.
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:22.920]   And they describe the protocol of, at the time,
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:25.560]   a fantastic, very interesting designer,
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:28.120]   a guy called Buckminster Fuller.
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:30.880]   And he created a design principle.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.120]   And that design principle
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:35.400]   was called the Dymaxion principle.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.640]   The Dymaxion principle was principally used initially
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.360]   to build unique building structures.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:47.280]   And it uses this notion of different sort of almost spokes
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:49.560]   that interconnect in a central hub
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.520]   that creates a self-supporting structure.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:52.800]   The most obvious,
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.920]   have you ever been to one of those geodesic domes
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:57.360]   and inside you go in and it's sort of like
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:59.880]   a botanical garden and it's all tropical,
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.280]   despite you being in a,
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.080]   let's say being in England and London
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.440]   and it's beautifully tropical inside of there.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:08.240]   That structure, that sort of lattice structure,
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:10.840]   that comes in part from his design.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:12.960]   This was the Dymaxion principle.
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:15.200]   And he scaled it to different things.
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:18.080]   The Dymaxion car, the Dymaxion house,
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:21.880]   the Dymaxion dome, fascinating.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:23.800]   But he was no fan of sleep.
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:28.200]   And he saw sleep as a rather significant waste of time
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.640]   when, just like the rest of his Dymaxion principle,
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.320]   he could be harnessing more efficiency out of the system
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.800]   with less structure and here less sleep structure
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:42.200]   inserted into his 24 hour period.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.800]   So he was the first one to describe his schedule
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:48.680]   and it was called the Dymaxion schedule of polyphasic sleep.
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:52.640]   So it may have been a practice earlier in the record,
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.200]   but that's the earliest one I could find.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.360]   So let's come back to the claims of polyphasic sleep,
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.640]   that it could improve, let's say your mood
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.760]   or your cognition or your productivity or your health.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.720]   A group of scientists at Harvard,
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:10.640]   some of my old colleagues from Harvard,
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:13.440]   they looked at all of the literature
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:17.520]   on all of the studies that were polyphasic-like
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:19.800]   or testing this claim.
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:22.240]   And the first thing that they found
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:25.520]   was to their claims of improved cognition,
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:28.880]   productivity, mood, as well as health,
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:30.840]   they found no supportive evidence
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:33.800]   that polyphasic sleep was helpful.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:35.480]   Then they turned the tables and they said,
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.320]   well, could it be hurtful?
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.880]   And in fact, that's exactly what they found.
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:43.280]   Firstly, the total amount of sleep that you get
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.120]   on any one of those schedules is decreased significantly.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:48.040]   Now, of course, that's the goal.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:51.960]   The quality of sleep that you get though is miserable.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.760]   Your sleep efficiency,
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:56.040]   even when you're having these short periods of time,
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:59.480]   especially during the waking hours, is very poor.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:02.960]   It's not a type of even short sleep that you would wish for.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:04.840]   Third, they found that it would reduce
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:07.360]   your REM sleep amounts.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:08.760]   So that was the first set of findings.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.600]   Your sleep is no better.
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:13.160]   If anything, it's significantly worse.
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:15.240]   And then they started to find
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.240]   that there were significant impairments
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:18.360]   in many of those things,
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:21.280]   impairments in cognition, in judgment-making
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.800]   and decision-making, impairments in mood,
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:27.000]   and some aspects of impairments in metabolic health,
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.920]   particularly glucose regulation.
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:33.120]   So when it comes to polyphasic sleep,
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.040]   sleeping like a baby, if you're an adult,
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.800]   seems to be a rather unwise piece of advice.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:41.360]   - Yeah, I mean, it probably goes along
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.280]   with eating baby food, drinking breast milk,
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:48.280]   and having somebody else clothe and change you as an adult.
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:51.800]   It's probably not advisable.
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:56.760]   It doesn't seem to be at least supported by the data.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:00.440]   And again, I want to be so careful here,
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:02.840]   and you're very careful too.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.680]   I'm not here to necessarily tell anyone
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.560]   absolutely how to live their life.
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:10.440]   I'm just a scientist, and all I can do
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.400]   is give you the information, just as you do,
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.680]   and then it's up to you to make the best decisions
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:17.000]   that you wish to make.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.640]   All I would say is that I would hope
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.680]   that as long as you're not hurting yourself
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:24.000]   and harming your health,
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.800]   and you're not hurting other people,
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:27.880]   and it makes you happy,
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:30.880]   then I say, whatever it is in life, good luck.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.360]   I embrace it.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:35.560]   - I always say, do as you wish, but know what you're doing.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:39.080]   And don't hurt yourself or anybody else.
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.240]   - Can you get me that T-shirt?
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.840]   And I will wear it five days through Tuesday.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.680]   So here in this regard, though,
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.560]   I would say the evidence would suggest
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.920]   that maybe you're compromising your health
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.520]   and your wellness, but that's your choice,
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:52.360]   and I understand it.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.040]   So again, no judgment.
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:55.240]   To the question, however,
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:58.120]   of as long as you're not hurting other people,
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:01.640]   here, I would say that there is a pause for caution,
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.480]   because what we know is that
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:04.800]   when you're not getting sufficient sleep,
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.840]   I described all of the health consequences
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.160]   in the first episode.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:09.800]   There's another danger here,
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:12.200]   which is road traffic accidents.
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.360]   And we describe these microsleeps that happen
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.280]   and why car accidents that are caused by sleepiness
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.080]   can be so catastrophic.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:21.120]   There's a very interesting study that was done
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.080]   where they looked at people getting less than six hours
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.440]   of sleep for several nights,
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.440]   and they put them into a driving simulator.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.480]   And they asked, what is the probability
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:33.920]   that you have a crash or an off-road event?
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:36.760]   And sleeping less than six hours a night
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:39.200]   resulted in a 30% increase
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:41.760]   in you getting into a car crash.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.360]   Now, the AAA released some data showing that
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:49.360]   when you get down to five hours of sleep,
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:51.840]   there is, I think it's something like two to three times
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.120]   higher likelihood of an accident based on real data.
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:57.360]   And then when you are on four hours of sleep,
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.960]   it was close to a 10 times greater risk.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:02.480]   So in other words, the less and less sleep that you get,
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:06.080]   it's not a linear increase in your risk of a car accident,
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.960]   it's an exponential increase.
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:10.600]   So I bring this back to polyphasic sleep,
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:14.680]   because I don't know, think about that 30% study.
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:17.080]   Let's not go to the extreme, just less than six hours
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.240]   of sleep.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.280]   If this evening you called a taxi,
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:24.920]   and it turns out two taxis turned up,
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:26.920]   and outside of your door, I said, look,
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.080]   one of these two, you can choose either one of them,
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.400]   but I'll just tell you that one of these taxis
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.080]   has a 30% higher likelihood of getting in a crash
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.160]   relative to the other, and it's this one on the right,
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.720]   which would you like to pick?
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:39.200]   Or which would you like to put your wife
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.440]   and children in to send?
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.640]   It's very obvious.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:47.200]   So I raised that question just to be mindful.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.640]   No one would wish to cause harm on someone else.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.480]   To carry the harm of someone else by way of your own doing
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:56.720]   on your shoulders for the rest of your life
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:57.880]   is not one I would wish for,
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:59.800]   and it's not one that you would wish for.
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:01.640]   That's the only cautionary note.
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:04.080]   But other than that, I would say,
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.680]   sort of live life to the full.
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.400]   - Well, that brings us to the conclusion
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:13.600]   of yet another incredible voyage
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.560]   into the landscape of sleep,
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:18.320]   most notably the different phases,
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:21.480]   monophasic, biphasic, and polyphasic sleep,
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:25.520]   and naps and caffeine, and all of their interactions.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:28.800]   These are such important topics at the level of concepts,
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:30.120]   at the level of mechanisms,
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:32.560]   and as you've also beautifully described,
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.360]   at the level of protocols,
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:37.120]   that is actionable tools that people can apply.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.760]   So thank you ever so much, Matt,
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:43.240]   for taking us even further along this voyage.
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:46.440]   I'll just remind people that episodes one and two
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.440]   of this series that Matt is so generously providing
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.600]   information about sleep for us are out,
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:57.200]   and those can be accessed
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:59.160]   through links in the show note captions.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.160]   Those fill in yet other mechanisms and aspects of sleep,
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:04.360]   and I'm also particularly excited
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:07.720]   for the fourth installment in the series coming up
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:12.160]   about the relationship between sleep, memory, and creativity.
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:15.960]   So just incredibly important topics relevant to everybody.
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:18.360]   I also just want to make note
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:20.320]   that I really appreciate you highlighting
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:22.840]   some of the developmental shifts that occur with sleep.
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:25.600]   I often get questions about, you know,
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:28.800]   sleep in children, and babies, and elderly adults,
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:31.040]   as well as all the ages in between,
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:34.040]   and you've just built this incredible tapestry
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:36.320]   of information for people to think about
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.080]   and act upon should they choose.
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:40.560]   So thank you, Matt, ever so much,
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:43.040]   and I look forward to episode four.
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:44.120]   - Andrew, thank you.
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:45.280]   It is such a privilege,
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:47.560]   and it remains just my absolute delight
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.480]   to be here with you.
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:49.320]   Thank you.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:51.160]   - Thank you for joining me for today's episode

[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:31.440]   I do read all the comments.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:33.440]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:34.920]   we discuss supplements.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.080]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:39.080]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.480]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:42.440]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.600]   To learn more about the supplements
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.240]   discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:47.800]   go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.680]   that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:52.920]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:55.640]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.120]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.640]   And on all those platforms,
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:02.960]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.440]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:05.880]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:07.720]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:09.240]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:12.520]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:13.680]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:15.440]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:18.320]   our Neural Network newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.040]   that provides podcast summaries,
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:22.000]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.360]   one-to-three-page PDFs that cover everything
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:26.280]   from neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.360]   to sleep, to deliberate cold exposure,
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:29.760]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:32.800]   We have a foundational fitness protocol, and much more,
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.760]   all of which, again, is completely zero-cost.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.840]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:39.040]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter,
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:41.480]   and by supplying your email, you can subscribe.
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:42.760]   I want to point out that we do not
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:44.600]   share your email with anybody.
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:45.920]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:48.080]   for today's discussion all about sleep
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.680]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:51.720]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:53.720]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:56.300]   (upbeat music)
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:58.880]   (upbeat music)
