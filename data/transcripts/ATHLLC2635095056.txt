[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.040]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.880]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.360]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.080]   I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.400]   to help you get the best experience in life.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680]   And one of those things is managing time.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.840]   And time management guru, Laura Vanderkam,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.360]   who I've had on the show before,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.200]   has a new book called Tranquility by Tuesday.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.260]   I thought it was a good book that offered nine rules
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.940]   to help people spend more time on what matters.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.560]   But there was one expression in the book
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.860]   that really stuck out with me.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.140]   We should all be time millionaires.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.980]   And that sounds great.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.340]   Even better than being a money millionaire, maybe.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.500]   But how does it happen?
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380]   People can't just create more time in their day
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.520]   unlike money, so what's the secret?
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.180]   And that's where today's guest can help.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.640]   His name's Dan Martell.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.140]   He's a good longtime friend of mine,
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.100]   and he has a new book about just this.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.600]   It's called Buy Back Your Time, Get Unstuck,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.540]   Reclaim Your Freedom, and Build Your Empire.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.780]   In his years as a successful entrepreneur,
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.300]   after a rough childhood and a few run-ins with the law,
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.180]   he built five companies, sold three of them,
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.220]   and currently runs SaaS Academy,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.900]   the world's largest coaching program
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.700]   for founders of software-as-a-service businesses.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.300]   But you don't have to have founded a business
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.540]   to apply these principles.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.840]   We're gonna talk about why buying back time
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.460]   has become his superpower,
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.620]   why mindset is such a key part of buying back time,
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.320]   how anyone can learn from super successful people
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.040]   like Oprah or Richard Branson
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.760]   about how they've increased their productivity,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.940]   and more importantly, their fulfillment in life.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.060]   We wanna talk also about how you can create a playbook
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.260]   at work or home to codify how you do something,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.700]   and also to help someone else do it for you.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.540]   We'll also touch on why almost everyone should consider
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.880]   hiring some type of administrative assistant,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.100]   and how Dan uses a house manager
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.080]   to take care of nearly every aspect of his family's life,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.500]   and ways that you can start to implement
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.100]   pieces of that in your own.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.460]   There'll probably be a lot more,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.640]   so let's get started right after this.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.700]   Dan, welcome to the show.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.580]   Thanks for being here.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.660]   - Chris, it's an honor.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.940]   I'm super excited.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.560]   This is the podcast I've been wanting to do for a long time,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.540]   just 'cause I know your audience is nerdy
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.020]   as much as I am on this topic.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.780]   - I want to start letting people know
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.220]   who's coming on to get questions,
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.300]   'cause I'm sure people listening now would have great things.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.740]   So that's something I might kick off in 2023.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.660]   But I wanna jump right in.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.180]   Saving time, freeing it up,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.800]   buying it back with help from others is your superpower.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.020]   We've talked about this before, both in work and life.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.140]   I wanna hear how you got so good at it,
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.980]   because it's something that so many people struggle with,
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.780]   and also why you think it's so important
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.900]   that people start doing it,
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.380]   no matter where they are in their stage of life.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.940]   - I learned this the hard way.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.460]   I've been a business builder,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.100]   tried to be an entrepreneur growing up,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.020]   failed for seven years, just tried.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.140]   And when I was 24, I found a different gear.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.300]   Sounds crazy, but I read my first business book,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.580]   turned out to be a good move.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.020]   And then I actually hired a business coach
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.660]   this guy named Bob, he was an E-Myth certified coach.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.460]   And Bob taught me a lot about business.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.300]   And when I was 24, I started this company called Spheric.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.820]   But what happened for me is over a four-year period,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.980]   even though we grew a lot,
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.800]   we became a multi-million dollar company
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.940]   within a couple of years and grew to about 40 employees
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.180]   and won a bunch of awards,
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.260]   I just got really good at being productive.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.860]   I didn't understand how to think of time and energy
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.620]   and just how I was showing up as a brother
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.060]   and a son and partner in life and as a friend.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.380]   And what happened was,
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.500]   is I was working at the office on a Sunday morning
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.260]   and I was supposed to be back around 11 o'clock.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.620]   I was engaged to a woman at the time
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.220]   and we had just bought a house.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.020]   And before I knew it, it was two o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.820]   And I was like, ran home and walked into the house
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.820]   and I found my fiance in tears
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.500]   and she just was beside herself.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.020]   And she just looks at me and decides that was that.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.620]   And she just goes, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.100]   And takes the ring off and drops it on the counter.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.500]   And she walked out and seven weeks before our wedding,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.820]   my life just shattered.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.980]   'Cause I think anybody that's done anything
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.260]   from working hard at their job
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.780]   to taking risk in a business,
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.260]   they don't do it really for themselves.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.180]   I was doing it for her.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.260]   I was doing it for our future,
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.980]   our lives that we were gonna build together.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.380]   And that was when I had to like look in the mirror
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.820]   and ask myself,
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.780]   there's gotta be a different way to approach time
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.580]   because there was a six month period, Chris,
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.420]   that I actually thought that
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.980]   because I'm so driven in life and I was so horrible,
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.340]   I would go to birthday parties and bring my laptop.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.460]   And that was normal.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.060]   And I would think to myself,
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.340]   I'm the best friend ever
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.060]   'cause I'm so busy that I showed up
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.540]   and I'd sit in the living room on a laptop
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.060]   while everybody else was enjoying music and partying.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.260]   And it was just crazy.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.660]   That was the moment where I started reading books
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.540]   around leadership and personal development.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.140]   Really diving into that component of it.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.980]   And I just realized that
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.700]   it's not just about being super productive,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.140]   even though I think I've gotten world-class at that.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.980]   I've read all the productivity books.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.420]   It's really about understanding how your energy flows
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.700]   throughout your calendar and your week and your month
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.220]   and your quarter and all these things
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.060]   so that you can show up to the work or the people
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.620]   in a completely different way.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.740]   And that's why I wrote this book.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.060]   It's just become such a foundational part of my life
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.420]   that if we fast forward to today,
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.020]   I have two incredible kids.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.860]   I have dinner with them every night.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.300]   I do quarterly retreats with my wife.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.820]   We go to seminars, personal development programs together.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.860]   I think I did 12 weeks of vacation this year.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.460]   And I'm the CEO of two eight-figure companies
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.900]   where I wake up and push things forward.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.980]   And there was no way that I could have done that
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.820]   if I didn't go through that painful moment
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.540]   to force me to learn the lessons
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.460]   that I share with people today.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.580]   - Well, it sucks that you went through it,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.300]   but I know that you're now in a good place
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.340]   and I'm fortunate that you've learned those lessons
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.500]   so you can share them with us.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.020]   Where do you think people start with this?
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.260]   When I just heard you describe all of the stuff
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.420]   that you're doing now,
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.220]   my head kind of doesn't know how to compute it.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.500]   I'm like, well, I just have this one small little thing
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.340]   that's a podcast.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.300]   It's not the eight-figure company.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.460]   It's just one of them.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.260]   I don't have that much vacation.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.500]   My wife and I don't go on these retreats.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   So it just seems impossible.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.380]   - It kind of is.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.820]   I forgot to mention, I also did three Ironmans this year.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.900]   So it's kind of nuts, but Chris, we don't start there.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.500]   That's not where I started.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.940]   I think that the big thing for people to understand
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.860]   is that their calendar is telling them a story
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.300]   of what's important to them.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.900]   And I tell this to people all the time.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.500]   It's like, if you show me your calendar,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.660]   I will tell you what is important to you,
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.980]   not what you tell me is important to you.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.460]   I work with a lot of at-risk youth
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.220]   and I just even do the same process with them
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.300]   is we do a calendar audit.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.420]   We look at what I call a time and energy audit
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.980]   of where are you actually spending your time
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.580]   and allocating that,
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.100]   and try to create a life that's by design, not by default.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.460]   That's like a first principle.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.100]   I can teach you all the ways to get more time,
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.980]   but if you don't at least admit to yourself that,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.580]   "Hey, you have to be a little bit more proactive.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.140]   "You gotta be a planner.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.260]   "You need to look at your time and assess
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.500]   "and have a period of reflection,"
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.180]   to ask yourself like, "Was this a good use of my time?
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.300]   "Did it deliver not only the success impact
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.660]   "that I would like it to have in my career
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.820]   "or with my friends, but did it also bring the joy?"
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.620]   One thing I do every year at the end
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.860]   is I look at my previous 12-month period
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.500]   and I look at all the things I said yes to and I did.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.220]   And then I go like, "Okay, what were the best experiences?"
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.340]   And then I go, "Okay, what's true about those ones?"
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.220]   And one example in my life is I don't go on vacation
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.740]   unless there's a physical component to what I'm doing.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.340]   I've had people like, "Hey, come to Europe
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.460]   "and let's go drive supercars."
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.020]   I'm like, "Meh, what else?
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.700]   "Are we gonna go hike a mountain?
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.660]   "Are we gonna do a three-day bike trip?"
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.100]   I just had this feedback loop.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.940]   And that's for me.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.760]   For other people, they're like,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.180]   "I have no interest in doing that,
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.100]   "but riding around in supercars in Europe sounds fun.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100]   "Let me do that."
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.540]   I'm just saying if we don't have a process of reflection,
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.860]   then there's no way you can be proactive
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.060]   and that's where it starts.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.740]   It's with the calendar
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.420]   and it's not just a productivity thing,
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.860]   it's an energy thing.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.060]   'Cause this is the cool part, Chris.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.400]   I learned that the energy that I bring to the work
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.500]   can have a three to four times increase in output.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.420]   What do I mean by this?
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.800]   Well, before I start doing a creative project,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.420]   I'm full of self-doubt and frustration and anxiety
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.480]   and all these negative beliefs and I'm in low energy.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.500]   The thing I'm creating literally has an impact.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.380]   It's so funny because I see that where it's like,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.920]   "Okay, if you're organizing an event
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.740]   "and one of the tasks for you to do
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.800]   "is to go and recruit sponsors,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.340]   "if you just got in a fight with your better half
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.020]   "because you forgot to do something,
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.020]   "that energy shows up in the emails,
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.180]   "it shows up in your language,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.380]   "it shows up in your body."
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.820]   And it's just so fascinating
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.940]   that people don't consider that.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.740]   So for me, I'm always looking at the work I do
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.900]   and I just use a green highlighter and a red highlighter.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.040]   It's like, this gives me energy and this takes my energy.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.980]   And as much as I can, I try to remove the things
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.660]   that take my energy so that I'm stacking
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.000]   this positive energy flow to the work
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.500]   because it literally will have a two, three,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.160]   four times amplifier to the outcome I'm after.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.260]   I'm sure there are things,
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.380]   especially for anyone listening who has a job
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.860]   and they're not the boss, that just take the energy out.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.700]   Are there certain places or times a day
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.940]   where you put those things?
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.660]   Yeah, I think everybody's different.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.540]   I think, Chris, maybe you can relate to this
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.740]   with the new family.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.620]   Before I had kids versus after I had kids,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.900]   I used to be somebody that was more of a night owl
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.340]   and then I would start my day later and that was okay.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.900]   Maybe I would get to work and I would jump into meetings
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.900]   and then do some more creative work in the afternoon.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.300]   And then what happened is once I had
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.460]   these human alarm clocks, my two sons,
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.820]   and they're 11 months apart, it was bananas,
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.400]   which was another forcing function
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.380]   to get really good at the stuff I talk about.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.460]   What I do now is I do all of my creative work
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.300]   in the morning and maybe if your boss tells you
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.940]   what to do with your time, but I know my team,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.940]   we focus on outcomes.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.900]   We don't tell people like what they should do.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.680]   Sure, there's meetings they have to be at,
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.520]   but they're responsible for their own calendar.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   So if you can design it, the energy flows.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.620]   Like what works good for me is all my creative work
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.020]   I do in the mornings.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.940]   I try to push out any in-person conversations till later on.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.100]   I personally like to work out at lunch
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.160]   because it creates a reset.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.100]   And then I bring that reset energy
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.100]   into the afternoon conversations.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.180]   And then I batch.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.780]   There's so much stuff we can talk about around
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.880]   like just getting more out of the time we have.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.580]   So it's so funny 'cause like a lot of times
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.620]   I'm like managing my leaders and they're talking to me,
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.820]   you know, I'm overwhelmed.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.760]   I don't have this and this.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.420]   And then we do a time and energy audit with their calendar.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.460]   And it's really just about negotiating
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.260]   like constraints in an interface.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.740]   Like a lot of people have the ability to call somebody up
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.020]   and say, "Hey, I know we have this meeting
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.800]   every Tuesday at nine.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.860]   Is there any way we can move it to 11am?"
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.800]   Because it's the only thing that's breaking up my morning.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.900]   And if I had an extra hour and a half
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.840]   and uninterrupted not broken up time
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.460]   to work on like some creative projects,
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.380]   I really think I'd be more effective.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.580]   Most people would be like,
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.580]   "Yeah, it actually doesn't change my life.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.340]   And if that's gonna support you, like game on."
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.460]   So I just think like trying to understand
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.260]   how you like to work.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.960]   And then the key is to honor the calendar.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.140]   It's like, I know what my week looks like
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.020]   and I review my calendar the night before
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.300]   and try to tweak anything that needs to be there.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.540]   And then when it shows up,
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.820]   like I put my work in the calendar,
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.020]   even if there's nobody else involved.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.740]   Like I literally, my to-do list is in my calendar
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.740]   and I just honor what I put in there.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.980]   I think too often people drag their feet,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.820]   spend a little too much time on TikTok or Instagram,
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.940]   whatever.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.260]   And then that thing that they had an hour blocked out of,
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.340]   it's really 35 minutes and they're rushing through it.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.380]   So there's that.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.340]   But if you have the discipline and you're proactive,
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.940]   then I think that energy management flow
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.780]   is actually more productive than just saying
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.940]   I'm managing my time and I'm being productive in my time.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.980]   And that's what shifted for me after my fiance left me
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.260]   and I had to rebuild my life was now I structure things
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.340]   so that when I transition in between meetings,
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.660]   I can be 100% present.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.940]   Because before I was just dealing with like arguments
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.020]   and friction and what I call emotional shrapnel
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.220]   that often I was creating myself.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.780]   If you're not a planner, one of my best friends,
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.180]   amazing human being, but gosh darn it,
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.780]   this guy is so forgetful and not a planner.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.420]   The amount of times that I've seen him lose
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.940]   like two or three hours,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.660]   I seen him drive eight hours to go pick something up
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.980]   because he'd forgotten he needed it
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.300]   the next day for something.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.380]   And I just think to myself like,
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.060]   man, if he just spent a little bit more time
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.940]   measuring twice, cutting once,
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.700]   he would get back like two months of his year.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   He would pull forward two months of productivity
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.460]   into his calendar year
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.980]   for like a fraction of the time invested.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.820]   So again, it's emotional shrapnel, it's self-inflicted.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.260]   You're literally throwing hand grenades off in your life.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.180]   And then you're dealing with the fallout of it
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.300]   just because you just haven't built that skill set
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.940]   and that discipline of being a little bit more disciplined.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.780]   - So two things.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.900]   One, I encourage anytime I have a meeting
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.980]   that gets invited to me,
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.740]   especially if it's a recurring meeting at work,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.620]   I guess technically I'm not at a company anymore,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.060]   but when I was,
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.060]   if they didn't select the let guests modify events button
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.100]   in Google Calendar or I'm sure
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.420]   on whatever calendaring system,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.540]   I immediately follow up and I say,
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.660]   hey, I know this meeting is not for a couple of weeks
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.020]   or can you enable this feature?
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.900]   And I had it enabled by default.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.300]   So I'd encourage everyone to make calendaring easier
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.020]   to just ask everyone to enable that feature
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.220]   on any recurring meeting
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.020]   so that you have the ability to move it
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.380]   without having to say, hey, can we move it?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.460]   Now we gotta go back and forth spending on Slack or email,
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.300]   just enable that.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.140]   So that's one.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.220]   Two, you talk a lot about discipline,
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.780]   but let's talk about what happens when I sit down
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.180]   and I've got 30 minutes blocked off
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.300]   to go plan the next episode I'm gonna do
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.500]   and there's a million other little tiny things
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.540]   on a to-do list that I could go try to knock off
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.980]   that seem easier to make progress on.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.380]   How does that discipline work for you?
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.980]   What makes that possible?
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.380]   - I think what's unique if you watch the way I work
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.060]   is I actually take all those projects
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.260]   or things that are in my calendar
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.820]   and I break down the tasks of the work I'm gonna do
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.700]   in the calendar description.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.300]   So everything that is creative output that I need to do,
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.660]   and I'm literally looking at like 17 projects
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.860]   I'm working on,
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.300]   they already have the mini tasks inside of it broken down
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.580]   because most people procrastinate
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.900]   'cause they don't have clarity
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.820]   as to what the next action item.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.100]   So if the thing says 60 minutes to go recruit sponsors
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.540]   for event or some play or whatever it is,
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.020]   and in it, it's like send five emails.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.940]   Like you're literally that descriptive.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.780]   You're like send five emails to this person,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.220]   call John, ask him about this.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.220]   I write it all down and kind of go,
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.460]   I would say 120% of what would need to happen
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   for the goal to achieve.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.140]   So like I always like try to like give myself
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.820]   a little bit more tasks to do.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.980]   That way if I don't get to it or if I do get to it,
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.660]   it's just it increases the probability
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.180]   of the thing happening.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.020]   'Cause I coach so many CEOs,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.180]   we do these calendar audits.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.660]   And I'm like, "Why didn't you do that?"
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.820]   And they're like, "The truth was,
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.100]   I didn't actually know what I needed to do."
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.660]   And it's like, "Cool, here's what we're gonna change."
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.340]   Not when you gotta do the work,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.780]   but as you plan your week.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.780]   So for me, I do them on Sunday nights.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.700]   And I know a lot of people are like,
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.940]   "Look, you're asking me to work Sunday."
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.500]   It's like, "You can do it Monday morning if you want."
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.580]   But Sunday night, I look at my projects
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.380]   and I grab the big rocks and I put them in,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.820]   for me, my mornings.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.460]   And I put them into typically 90 minute blocks.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.540]   Like that's about as long as I wanna work on one project
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.700]   for until I kinda get bored with it.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.140]   And I outline in that 90 minute blocks
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.740]   all the stuff I'm gonna do.
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.740]   And I just keep a note file and I just copy and paste it.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.340]   And I work through that list.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.740]   So like Monday, I might attack it.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.580]   Tuesday, I'll attack it.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.420]   Wednesday, I'll attack it.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.300]   And I'm just working through that list.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   I'll literally, as I get done that 90 minute block,
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.780]   I'll just like edit it for the next day.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.340]   'Cause it's shorter, 'cause I got a bunch of stuff done.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.180]   And then that way, when I sit down,
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.900]   there's no procrastination because like you said, Chris,
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.900]   it's like, I know I have this other to-do list
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.820]   that I can go get some wins on.
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.940]   But technically, your big project is a to-do list.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.100]   And if you just break it down,
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.060]   then you just attack that one and you can get some wins
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.980]   so you can build momentum.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.060]   'Cause I always got frustrated in software development land
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.300]   that I grew up in.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.500]   Dude, it would take like months to write code
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.100]   to get a product built.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.700]   Whereas this other guy who works in construction,
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.940]   he literally sees every day when he's done
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.780]   the progress he made.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.180]   And it feels so good.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.140]   I know that when I was helping my dad growing up,
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.020]   build a deck or redo a roof or whatever,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.740]   felt so good to make these small wins.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.300]   That's how I've set up my life.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   Is I just wanna take the bigger outcome,
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.860]   break it down into projects, break those down into tasks,
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.700]   put it in my calendar.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.460]   And then I just follow and I honor it.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.940]   And look, if I get the wrong list
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.420]   and I like get some feedback, it's like,
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.220]   oh, I thought I would do this and that didn't work.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.740]   Next time I just change it.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.380]   But it just allows you to build momentum with your day.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.220]   And I think that's what a lot of people are missing out of.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.420]   It's the lack of clarity.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.260]   People procrastinate 'cause they don't have clear,
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.060]   like, boom, this is what I gotta go do.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.820]   One, it's 15 minutes, let's go get it done.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.820]   Let's go get a small win.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.860]   Let's build some momentum.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.980]   And then that momentum becomes almost addictive.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.100]   Like I just get excited about how much can I get done
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.100]   in a period of time and how can I look for leverage?
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.580]   - Leverage is gonna be a bulk of this discussion.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.380]   But before, I wanna know,
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.020]   do you keep a separate to-do list
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.260]   or is the calendar the to-do list?
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.380]   - I keep a to-do list.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.940]   I kind of have like a high level Google Doc, okay?
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.860]   It's called to-dos.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.460]   And what's unique about it,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.340]   and this is how I'm able to unplug at the end of the day.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.300]   Now I'm blessed to have an executive assistant
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.260]   that manages 99% of my inbox.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.780]   But things that do end up in my world,
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.940]   what I do at the end of the day is I take anything.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.180]   That's why I like the world we live in
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.540]   where it's all linkable.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.940]   Anything that I need to process the next day,
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.620]   I put it in the to-do list and I link to the email.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.060]   So it's literally, it'll say like reply to Chris
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.900]   or whatever it is.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.260]   And I link to the email on my Gmail,
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.900]   and then I put it in the Google Doc,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.100]   and then I grab, let's say the five or six that are there,
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.460]   and I put it in my calendar the next morning
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.820]   for a 60-minute block.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.780]   And it'll just say like process to-dos.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.620]   And that way again,
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.220]   like this is how I want it defined and easy.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.340]   So I open the calendar and I just open up all my tabs.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.140]   I just like open up just those emails.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.540]   See, that's where a lot of people get stuck.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.180]   They open up their inbox and then it's like,
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.580]   burp, burp, burp, all these things they gotta do.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.540]   I just open up the tabs to the thing.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.420]   It could be like review a copy for a blog post.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.180]   It's like a link just to the thing.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.620]   And when I'm done, I close the tab.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.660]   So I create almost like momentum I'm building
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.020]   'cause I like start on the left side
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.860]   and I work through them to prioritize.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.500]   And it's either emails or projects or creative stuff
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.100]   or like some mirror document I gotta prove or look at.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.260]   And then because I put it in that Google Doc
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.660]   at the end of my day, like at the very end of my day,
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.820]   that's the last thing I do is I look at my inbox,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.500]   I look at my projects list, I move them into the to-do,
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.860]   copy paste them, put it in my calendar.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.740]   Dude, I sleep like a champ.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.060]   Like I don't wanna brag, but I use Oura Ring.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.900]   I'm literally gonna pull up my Oura score right now
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.780]   'cause people see me wake up so early
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.180]   and they're like, "When do you sleep?"
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.620]   I got an 88 yesterday, which is a pretty beefy score.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.820]   I don't toss and turn.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.980]   My brain doesn't worry about forgetting stuff
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.580]   because I've locked and loaded it
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.420]   into my life and my calendar.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.180]   So that's like the to-do list of Google Doc.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.860]   And what's unique is at the top of it,
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.620]   I have all my 25-year vision stuff
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.220]   and five years and one year.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.340]   I'm a little crazy like that.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.460]   I don't worry about the how,
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.660]   but I do know what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.380]   Like I wrote down that I wrote this book six years ago.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.300]   I wrote down best-selling book, business category,
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.260]   and I stared at it for this long
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.260]   until two and a half years ago,
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.340]   we started working on the project.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.700]   But that way I'm looking at like the big vision stuff,
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.580]   25 years from now, 10 years, five years, one year.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.380]   And then my to-do and my calendar has to map.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.980]   I've gotta be able to see what I'm doing this week
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.900]   and how it drives to those outcomes.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.100]   Specifically, like you label them to it
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.940]   or just because it's at the top of the dock,
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.780]   it's a constant reminder.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.460]   Because it's at the top and I scan it every morning
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.620]   as part of my process.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.660]   So before I work on any of the to-dos,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.220]   I just read through them.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.380]   It's almost like it ramps up into my mind.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.620]   It's like, "Oh yeah, don't forget.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.700]   This is why we're doing it."
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.940]   I have very unique approaches that work for me.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.060]   I call it RPM.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.700]   I always focus on results, then purpose, then the activity.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.580]   So a lot of people focus on the how.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.940]   I focus on the what and the why first.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.180]   Because I've learned a long time ago,
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.020]   the purpose of why I'm doing something
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.220]   actually matters more than the actual outcome
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.660]   that I'm trying to achieve.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.380]   They're one in your list that you could walk through those.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.300]   I can walk you through everything.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   I'm an open book.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.140]   Let me go.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.260]   I have it open right now.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.460]   So my vision for my life is help a million at-risk youth.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.660]   So mentor them.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.740]   So that's a big one.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.860]   Build the 3 billion multi-generational wealth.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.540]   These are big things, but that's where I'm at.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.140]   And so I can go through those, build a 30 million company,
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.820]   which we're well on our way by 2025.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.820]   So that's the vision stuff.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.860]   And then RPM is my different things.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.420]   So I have my high-speed ventures, $100 million fund.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.380]   I've got my book.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.620]   It literally says right there,
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.020]   buy back books at New York Times bestseller,
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.660]   back-end specific outcomes of those things,
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.140]   my coaching company.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.620]   Then it breaks down into quarterly projects
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.220]   that I've committed to to achieve these things.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.940]   So like big vision this year, quarterly projects.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.900]   And then I have my to-do list.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.140]   Oh, and I also have a waiting on.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.300]   This is another little secret tip that I like,
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.660]   which is I don't worry if people got back to me
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.100]   because if I send something to you,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.380]   and it's really important,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.100]   I only put stuff in my waiting on list
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.140]   if it's things that are gonna affect my goals.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.780]   But let's say I email you,
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.900]   I'll literally grab that sent email
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.980]   and put it in my waiting on list.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.100]   And I'll do the same thing where I'll open up
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.140]   all the waiting on, it might be five or six people,
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.900]   and then follow up.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.580]   So some people use software for that,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.300]   like follow up, whatever tools,
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.700]   but I just do it that way.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.900]   And that way I can visually see it.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.060]   But it's very simple.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.380]   It's a Google Doc.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.180]   For me, it's just superhuman, remind me.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.140]   If it's a thing I don't care about, I'll archive it.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.140]   And if it's a thing that I'm like,
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.100]   "No, this is really important.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.900]   "I want them in two weeks, remind me,
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   "in one week, remind me."
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.220]   I haven't found a good way
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.300]   to merge the to-do list and the email.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.100]   'Cause like 50% of my to-do list is email
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.780]   or it lives in my inbox maybe is a better way to frame it.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.140]   That's why I take it out.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.740]   I don't want it in the inbox.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.100]   I think there's tools like Motion is a new one
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.780]   that I've seen Facebook ads about like taking your to-dos
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.980]   and put them in your calendar.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.100]   But I just either manually do it
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.900]   or I have my assistant do it
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.380]   because we talk often about like,
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.020]   "Here are my top projects."
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.220]   And I use color coding in my calendar
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.540]   to know if I'm allocating the right amount of time
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.540]   for different projects.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.100]   So that's another little hack I use.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.420]   So if it's like this is like one, two, and three
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.940]   are the most important to me,
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.020]   I can visually look at the color coding we're using
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.700]   in my week to know if I'm allocating the right amount
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.660]   of time to move certain projects forward.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.820]   Like my book is orange right now.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.980]   And in the calendar is pretty orange
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.260]   because it is a top priority for me.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.100]   Well, I'm excited.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.980]   I got a chance to read it.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.780]   I wanna jump into the theme
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.060]   because it's one thing to be productive.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.340]   I've talked about it a little bit.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.620]   I love hearing the way you think about your time management,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.980]   but time's a limited resource.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.860]   And one of the only ways to get it back
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.460]   is to try to find ways to outsource what you're doing
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.420]   so that you have more time to do what you want.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.860]   So let's talk about it.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.260]   I know one of the things that I wanna start with
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.260]   is around mindset.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.700]   You bring up mindset a lot,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.900]   especially when it comes to buying back your time.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.980]   So maybe let's just talk about a few of the objections
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.900]   I think some people hear or think of
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.340]   when they think about this concept,
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.780]   which is like, "Well, I don't have the time
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.140]   "to go find someone to help me with all these things.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.220]   "I don't have the money to spend on this,
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.060]   "and no one can really do it like I can."
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.940]   So are there other big ones?
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.420]   Or how do you think about all the objections people have
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.860]   before we jump into the tactics?
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   So those are the top three,
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.180]   and we can kind of overcome those beliefs.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.060]   The other one that comes up often that is unexpressed,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.100]   but is underneath the surface is, "I don't feel worthy."
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.340]   And that one, I coach not a lot,
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.500]   but I've coached especially women CEOs,
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.020]   and they seem to struggle with it a bit more.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.660]   And the language that I hear is,
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.940]   "I just feel guilty that I can't run my company
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.660]   "and take care of my household."
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.420]   Or like, "I'm worried what my mom is gonna say,
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.220]   "or my mother-in-law, or like my neighbor."
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.300]   It's really fascinating to hear that.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.620]   But the truth is everybody's got their own
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.300]   limiting beliefs about the world
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.460]   that's gonna stop them from achieving more.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.740]   It doesn't matter if it's like getting more time back
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.780]   or being successful in your career,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.020]   you have to understand that your beliefs
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.140]   about how the world works and how we respond
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.300]   is what's stopping us.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.900]   The one of like, "I don't have time."
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.260]   Well, you decide what you do with your time.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.180]   Change the language to, "I choose not to make time for this."
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.940]   As soon as you change the language from, "I don't have time,"
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.820]   to, "I choose not to make time,"
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.980]   that's an honest conversation that you can then address.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.500]   But most people will blame an external factor and say,
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.660]   "Oh, I just don't have time for that."
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.020]   It's like, no, you do.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.780]   If we looked at your calendar and I asked you,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.300]   "Tell me what you did yesterday,"
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.940]   there'll be things that you chose to do
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.260]   instead of working on this problem.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.780]   So let's talk about why you're choosing not to do it.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.300]   So that's the first thing.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.980]   And by the way, you can apply that
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.460]   to so many different aspects.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.500]   I was talking to someone the other day,
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.220]   I was like, "God, I would love to lose 10 pounds."
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.500]   I was like, "Would you really?"
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.900]   'Cause like losing 10 pounds is not some mythical thing
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.260]   that is really hard to figure out.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.100]   Like a combination of diet and exercise-
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.460]   It's called caloric deficit over time.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.180]   Yeah, so like you can do it.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.940]   So don't say that you would love to do it
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.700]   because say, "I wish I had the time to do it."
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.540]   Well, not even that.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.660]   How about, "I don't wanna prioritize it right now."
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.900]   It's not important.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.380]   'Cause if it was important, you could just do it.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.220]   I still catch myself up in this, it's hard to get over it.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.700]   Like I feel like just as humans we're trained this way,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.340]   but yeah, you do have time.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.820]   Just how do you wanna prioritize your time?
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.060]   What's important to you right now?
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.860]   And if it's not, that's okay,
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.180]   but just be honest with yourself.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.020]   It's on that line.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.700]   I was coaching a client, Carrie,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.140]   and she was complaining about like,
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.620]   "I don't have time to go to the gym."
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.260]   It's like, she knew what she needed to do.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.700]   And then it's like, then we talked about it.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.540]   It's like you said, it's like,
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.300]   you're choosing not to do it.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.780]   You know the benefit of it.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.020]   There's some friction there.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.340]   There's a blockers we need to work through.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.260]   And once we work through it, then it was like, okay.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.500]   And it's this language of even I get to versus I have to.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.460]   I really think that like a rich life,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.340]   it's not about money,
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.460]   but let's just call it like a rich life versus a poor life.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.540]   A rich life is somebody that wakes up saying,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.660]   "I get to do this."
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.860]   Whereas a poor life is somebody wakes up and says,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.940]   "I have to do this."
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.220]   And it's such a subtle thing,
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.260]   but it will literally transform your life.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.700]   If you say like, "I get to work out.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.780]   "I get to go to work.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.060]   "I get to drop my kids off at whatever.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.420]   "I get to work on this project."
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.820]   These are things that you think are like tough or hard,
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.700]   or I don't want to do it, but it's like,
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.220]   yeah, let's reframe the stuff.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.580]   So on the belief, I can't afford it's another one.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.460]   Here's the way I think about it is
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.700]   every person has the ability to create value with their time.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.900]   It's why we have jobs.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.220]   When we start off in life, we trade time for money.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.860]   Some people create more value in that amount of time,
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.860]   so they get compensated by the market.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.500]   And Jim Rohn, he's one of the OG personal development guys
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.020]   back in the day, used to talk about this.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.620]   He goes, "A lot of people don't realize
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.060]   "is that the market is a value rewarding system.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.060]   "Whether we like it or not, we live in a capitalist society.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.380]   "And to the degree that you create value,
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.820]   "you will be rewarded for that.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.900]   "And it doesn't matter if you're a business owner
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.860]   "or a team member or CEO."
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.780]   Because he even says the highest paid CEO in the world
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.340]   makes $100 million a year.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.740]   And that's Tim Cook at Apple.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.980]   Well, the reason why the board pays him that
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.620]   and he gets that and nobody blinks at it
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.820]   is because he created a trillion dollars worth of value.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.580]   So my question to people when they say,
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.140]   "Well, I can't afford it."
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.060]   I want to ask them, "Well, how can you become more valuable?"
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.700]   Because if we can talk about how you become more valuable
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.580]   to your employer, to your team, to your community,
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.820]   then you start to ask yourself,
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.700]   "Well, now that I know what I can do to become more valuable,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.620]   "I need to find the time to do it."
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.500]   And that's where the time trading comes into play.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.540]   Well, that's what the best people in the world at
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.460]   is they're just good traders of time.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.780]   So you start off as time for money,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.180]   and you'll do that for a while
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.180]   until hopefully you're getting paid a lot more
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.820]   because you're becoming more valuable.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.220]   But then at some point,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.980]   it doesn't matter if you're a business owner or not,
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.940]   you got to get good at trading money for time.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.380]   That's level two, okay?
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.140]   And I talk about this in the book.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.260]   Level three is where I want everybody to eventually get
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.220]   is where you start trading money for money, right?
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.700]   This is the investing side.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.740]   These are skillsets.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.580]   These are beliefs.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.420]   These are strategies.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.940]   You have to develop them.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.820]   But that is the path of life.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.900]   And nobody shared this with me my whole life
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   until one day I realized it's like,
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.420]   "Oh yeah, we start off everybody.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.620]   "We start off trading time for money.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.180]   "And then if we get smart and more valuable,
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.220]   "then we trade money for time.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.460]   "And then if that works out really well
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.300]   "and we get good at that,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.500]   "then we have an excess or overcapacity of capital
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.980]   "to then invest to have our money work for us."
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.940]   And that's freedom.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.220]   And that's what people are after.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.740]   They're like, "Hey, I want to show up every day
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.220]   "and I want to create an outcome
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.180]   "so that one day I don't have to work.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.460]   "I can decide if I want to work."
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.220]   I get to, it's not a mindset thing.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.020]   It's actually like a reality.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.540]   And that's where I think life gets really interesting
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.460]   when you wake up and you get to decide
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.780]   what you want to create on.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.420]   But it starts by just becoming more valuable
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.180]   so that you have the resources
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.980]   to be able to buy back more time
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.620]   to then become more valuable again to the market.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.860]   And then there's the,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.900]   "Nobody can do it better than me, Chris."
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.860]   My role is 80% done by somebody else
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.020]   is 100% freaking awesome.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.020]   And I just think we got to reduce our expectations.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.020]   My wife, we were talking about this yesterday
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.460]   because she's like, "You're so good
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.980]   "at not worrying if the person
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.860]   "gets it right the first time."
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.620]   And I go, "Well, I can tell you where that comes from.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.580]   "Thousands of hours of being let down."
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.260]   And realizing that if I expect every person
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.660]   that I bring into my life to know everything I know
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.580]   and do everything the way I think I'm gonna do,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.660]   I'm just gonna live a life of being disappointed.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.580]   And instead, the way I look is I reframe it
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.020]   and I just say, "80% done by somebody else
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.700]   "is 100% freaking awesome."
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.660]   If I have somebody else go to the grocery store for me
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.140]   and bring me my food to my house,
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.820]   and yes, every once in a while,
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.700]   they got the wrong bananas or whatever,
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.060]   I didn't have to do it.
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.020]   And I'm really grateful that I got to take that time
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.660]   to go work on something creative
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.740]   or spend time with people I love or whatever.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.020]   And it just changes the expectation.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.700]   That's where when we start working on these beliefs,
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.060]   then it frees us up to actually invite other people
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.100]   to support us and use these tools to get more productive,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.500]   to get more done.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.460]   But if you hold onto these beliefs,
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.220]   then you'll always hit a ceiling
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.420]   and you'll never actually free up your time.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.140]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.540]   I get it, life comes at you fast.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.420]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.580]   for a good hang.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.620]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.580]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.540]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.500]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.260]   take care of the supplies.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.100]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.940]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.340]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.300]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.780]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.860]   that you got through another week.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.980]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.500]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.260]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.380]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.020]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.580]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.540]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.580]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.420]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.460]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.100]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.580]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.220]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.540]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.540]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.780]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.940]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.420]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.020]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.460]   in your situation,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.060]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.340]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.180]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.340]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.420]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.860]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.260]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.260]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.620]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.740]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.100]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.820]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.620]   are first generation wealth,
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.700]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.860]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.180]   and learn from each other
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.780]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.060]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.420]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.820]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.980]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.960]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.460]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.900]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.540]   to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.740]   So many of these conversations aren't happening
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.220]   anywhere else online.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.880]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.740]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.900]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.980]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.100]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.620]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.580]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.640]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.280]   I wanna go briefly back to the money one
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.920]   because I know that it's the one
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.120]   that I struggled with the most,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.000]   and I'm guessing maybe there's some people out here
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.620]   that are feeling the same way,
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.320]   which is it's not that you necessarily don't have the money,
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.720]   it's that it just feels irresponsible maybe,
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.120]   or if I were to watch a movie and then I'm like,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.440]   well, I should pay someone to go do this thing,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.240]   but like I had the time, I just watched this movie.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.480]   So how do you help people value their time?
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.900]   I always have them start simple.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.460]   And the truth is that they need to understand
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.400]   what their time's worth.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.380]   And the math equation is pretty straightforward.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.100]   It's whatever you get paid annually to do a job, right?
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.140]   So you make, let's say 100,000 a year, it's simple math.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.820]   And then you divide it by 2000, right?
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.380]   That's the amount of value of your hour.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.740]   That works out to about $50.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.700]   My rule, and I call it the buyback rate,
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.740]   is if you can pay somebody else
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.420]   to do whatever you're doing for a quarter,
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   like 1/4 of that amount, $12.50 in that circumstance,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.100]   then you should.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.780]   When you start using that filter in your personal life
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.460]   from laundry service, to house cleaning,
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.540]   to Uber Eats, to a lot of stuff,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.300]   you can start buying back that time.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.420]   Now, I also don't think you should buy back your time
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.540]   to hang out on a beach or watch Netflix.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.500]   I think you should ask yourself,
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.800]   again, it's that time trade.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.900]   It's how do we become more valuable to the market?
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.780]   And I also agree you should relax
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.060]   and enjoy yourself and recharge.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.940]   So I'm not saying you become a workaholic,
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.740]   but if you constrain yourself to say,
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.120]   "Look, I'm only going to invest 40 hours a week
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.100]   "in my career."
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.500]   So you hard block it and you create this constraint.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.260]   Then you go, "Okay, well, right now,
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.540]   "if I do a time and energy audit on my calendar,
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.420]   "I'm spending time on things that are taking my energy
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.900]   "and very low cost to pay somebody else to do."
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.980]   And then you attack that list of those items
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.300]   and you just start trying to bring support.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.420]   And then the key is go do things that make you more money.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.180]   And it only fits into one of two things.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.860]   You're either doing more of the thing
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   you're going to get paid more to do right now.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   So it's a lot easier, obviously,
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.580]   if you're in a role like sales
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.880]   or there's some performance component of the thing you do,
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.860]   but you can negotiate that with your employer.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.140]   Like I have half my team on some level
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.460]   of performance compensation.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.900]   So they have a clear target that if they hit,
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.620]   they get financially rewarded for it
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.140]   'cause that means everybody wins.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.300]   And then do more of that.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.580]   Like learn what that is or negotiate it with your employer
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.380]   and then free up your time.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.420]   And I'll give you a real example.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.860]   This guy, Wendell, who worked for me in sales,
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.700]   he was making a quarter million a year,
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   which is a lot and I get it.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.660]   But what he decided to do on his own time,
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.860]   because he started to see like,
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   hey, I'm on calls 30 hours a week on calls
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.460]   and then follow up and all this stuff.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.100]   He was listening to me coach my clients
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.060]   'cause like a lot of stuff we do is public
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.580]   inside of our company, not what our client shares,
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.260]   but me, I like record everything I do
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.540]   and just give it away to the team and put on social media.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.540]   And he hired his own assistant
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.820]   to literally do all of his follow-up,
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.660]   do his prospecting, manage his calendar,
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.020]   manage his inbox so that he could just do more calls
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.860]   'cause that's how he made more money.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.500]   So all of a sudden he doubles his output.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.460]   Then he has a surplus and he calls me out one day,
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.860]   he's like, I don't know what to do all this money.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.140]   I'm like, well, congratulations.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.420]   This is a very good problem to have, like, well done, sir.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.380]   And I tell him to go into real estate.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.580]   He's like, well, how do I do that?
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.020]   I go, that's you to figure out.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.020]   Like, this is the thing is you free up your time
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.820]   to then fill it with learning new skills that are valuable.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.100]   So he went into real estate and he hired a mentor.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.300]   This is what I teach people,
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.860]   like go find somebody that's done it before,
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.740]   bring that person in your life.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.460]   And now what's crazy is he only does sales
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.340]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.060]   because on Friday, his assistant is queuing up
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.940]   all of the showings for him to go look
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.860]   at new real estate deals.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.380]   He's already bought, I think he's on his fifth building.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.620]   He owns like 20 some doors or whatever it's called.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.100]   And like, he's doing really well
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.220]   because he's thought through this math.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.460]   And I know a lot of people are like, well, that's easy.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.500]   He's making a quarter million dollar a year.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.620]   It doesn't matter if you're making 50,000 a year or 100,
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.700]   you got to learn how to free up your time to then invest it
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.540]   in things that your employer is going to value
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.500]   or at least the market's going to value.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.580]   And then if you want to go chill out and watch Netflix,
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.700]   that's fine.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.940]   It's just, if you're during the day and during the day,
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.540]   you could do something to progress your career
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.060]   or you take an hour to drive to go get your food.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.300]   And instead you could just have the food delivered to you.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.100]   So you could not have to take an hour to go do that.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.220]   That sounds like a great trade.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.900]   You just need to know ahead of time
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.500]   when I'm buying back that time, I'm going to invest it.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.060]   I'm going to fill it with things that will compound
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.940]   and create more value in the future.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.980]   So there has to be trust.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.420]   You have to have sat down and thought about this
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.140]   and have a plan and you just keep working through it.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.500]   So I just tell people to allocate a budget, right, Chris?
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.220]   It could be very simple, $500 a month.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.540]   Just take $500 and do the time and energy audit
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.900]   on your calendar and say,
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.860]   I'm just going to give myself permission to buy back
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.700]   maybe less, let's call it $100 a month.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.260]   I don't know what it is.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.140]   And then if I buy back that time,
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.060]   I'm going to do this with that time
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.060]   that I think over a period of time will be more valuable.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.780]   It could be going to the gym.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.380]   'Cause I know for me, man, I show up way different
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.700]   if I worked out today than if I don't.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.540]   And that has a huge positive impact
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.820]   on the outcomes that I get to achieve.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.540]   So that's just the way I think about it.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.060]   So let's talk about some of those things
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.500]   that you think people can get started buying back.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.100]   You gave some examples that I think are well-known
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.900]   like ordering your groceries online
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.460]   or getting food delivered.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.260]   Great uses of trading dollars for time,
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.220]   I think, personally.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.500]   I do have some frustration with the grocery delivery
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.660]   because I felt like early on there were so many misses
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.340]   and poor replacements that if you were like me
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.140]   and you were trying to like plan a dinner out,
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.380]   you'd get the wrong thing.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.840]   Now I find that Amazon's inventory management
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.700]   for Amazon Fresh at least in the States is so good
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.140]   that I don't have that fear anymore.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.260]   So that's a few.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.580]   What are some of your favorites?
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.420]   There's so many.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.300]   When I look at like the early days of starting to do this,
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.020]   laundry service, I was crazy busy.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.780]   My fiance's pissed off at me.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.780]   I'm trying to get all my work done.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.620]   And this is what happened
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.180]   is I literally had to get a laundry service
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.620]   so that I could work on Sundays in the morning.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.140]   Normally I was done by 11 a.m.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.780]   That was my rule and I got in trouble that day.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.620]   But obviously like just having somebody else
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.900]   take care of your laundry, like wash and fold,
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.980]   game changer, just low-hanging fruit.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.140]   Having somebody come in maybe once every two weeks,
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.820]   maybe once a week to come in to clean your house,
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.020]   to take care of like the deep cleaning,
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.340]   that kind of stuff, that's a huge opportunity.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.180]   Some people are like,
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.740]   "I'm not gonna pay somebody else 25 bucks an hour
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.820]   "to do something I can do myself."
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.100]   All right, well, how about we just get better
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.180]   at getting our time back?
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.420]   How about you start using a calendar?
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.300]   Like that would be a big idea for people.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.540]   If we fail to plan, we plan to fail.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.140]   I don't know who said it, but like,
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.060]   I remember my wife's friend, she said that
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.180]   because she was just so frustrated with herself
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.460]   about the amount of wasted time running around your kids.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.060]   And I forgot this happened and that.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.660]   And it's like, people don't realize how much time
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.580]   is wasted in just the commute.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.780]   So even just asking yourself like,
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.180]   "Are you driving to Costco?"
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.020]   "Yes."
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.780]   "Why don't you just order online?"
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.260]   "Well, I like to go to Costco."
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.460]   "I know you like to go to Costco,
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.060]   "but if you tell me you like to go there
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.660]   "and you don't have enough time to go to the gym,
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.060]   "then you're making a decision to go to Costco
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.980]   "because you like it versus go to the gym,
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.460]   "which you know will have a compounding effect."
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.300]   Especially with the health.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.940]   When you're healthy, you have like 1,000 goals and dreams.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.460]   And when you're not, you have one.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.380]   And I bring that one up
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.540]   because if that's not front and center for a lot of people,
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.980]   it should be the driving force
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.380]   behind everything we're talking about today.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.500]   Because it will have the biggest impact on your life,
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.260]   your mental health, your physical health,
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.260]   worry your family will have for you.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.380]   If you don't want your family to worry,
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.220]   that's all parents want.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.620]   They want to know you're happy and healthy.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.460]   That's a big one.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.540]   One of the things is, again, when it comes to scheduling,
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.700]   it's everything from like cutting down on meetings,
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.420]   saying no, inviting people to you.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   That's a big one.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.660]   So for example, I don't do the got a second meetings,
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.100]   coffee meetings, et cetera.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.460]   Chris, and I'm sure you don't either
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.780]   'cause like I can buy myself coffee.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.700]   What I do instead is every Tuesday morning,
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.460]   I hike this mountain near my house.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.560]   And it's an open invite for anybody
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.580]   that wants to pick my brain or hang out with me
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.580]   to come and do the hike with me.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.380]   And I've been doing it now since I moved to this new city,
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.620]   we live in Kelowna, BC for two years.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.940]   So every Tuesday morning, 6.30 AM,
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.500]   if you want to come hang out with me, anybody,
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.060]   and this is an open invite for your audience.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.940]   If they want to fly to Kelowna and pick my brain,
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.080]   I will be there.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.140]   I call it net time, no extra time.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.860]   I compress all these other meetings into one experience.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.780]   And usually like it's a half hour hike up and then 15 down.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.020]   It allows me to have like great conversations.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.240]   It allows me to get my workout in.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.140]   So like that's a big time-saving one.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.140]   Even considering using like carpooling or public transit,
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.660]   and I'll tell you why,
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.180]   is a lot of people can do stuff if they're not driving.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.300]   A lot of people don't understand
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.800]   that taking the public transit, the train...
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.260]   I know in San Francisco, I used to use a car service.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.860]   Uber, actually funny enough.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.420]   So Travis, who started Uber,
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.320]   was an investor in my company, Flowtown.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.740]   And when it came out,
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.460]   I was like using it for next level stuff.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.820]   I remember Travis saying to me, he's like,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.440]   "You're the only person..."
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.580]   I would send Ubers to go pick up my girlfriend at the time
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.420]   to bring her to the date, to save me time.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.540]   I would use it as almost like a delivery system of people
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.340]   to bring them to me to save me time.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.280]   Now that's an advanced thing.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.540]   People aren't gonna be doing this, but that's one for sure.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.020]   And then there's just a bunch of apps.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.140]   - When you say that,
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.840]   like now they've built in the delivery function.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.420]   But I remember one time, little things like,
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.940]   I recorded the interview in person
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.580]   and the SD card didn't work.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.060]   And there's like a data recovery company in San Francisco.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.100]   And I was like, well, I'll just send the SD card
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.380]   to the company on an Uber instead of drive to the city
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.300]   and drive back.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.380]   Using that for delivery,
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.500]   you used to have to like convince the driver to do it.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.700]   - You had to like talk to them.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.220]   Yeah, now it's just part of the service.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.260]   - You're like, "Oh, I left my laptop at this meeting."
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.220]   And you're like, "Hey, do you think you could pick this lap?
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.420]   I'll have someone bring it out."
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.700]   So yeah, I love that one.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.860]   - My whole rule, if you had to put it into a list,
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.100]   it's go mobile.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.420]   I do not use services that don't have a mobile experience.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.780]   And this is for everything, home automation,
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.860]   security systems, lighting systems,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.220]   anything that my wife wants to buy
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.180]   that's like an electronic,
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.580]   I ask if they have a mobile app
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.140]   because I want to be integrated into my workflow
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.060]   and just be able to access it wherever I'm at.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:49.900]   That's a big one.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.620]   The other one is automation.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.020]   Anywhere that I'm doing the same thing over and over,
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.300]   I look for tools for automation.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.540]   We do that for lawn care.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:03.820]   We do it for locks, lights, cleaning cycles for things,
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.820]   and just services.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.900]   You know, like having somebody come to your house
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.340]   to clean your car.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.660]   That's a real thing.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.540]   Or like my buddy Brad,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.300]   his wife was spending every Wednesday afternoon
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.900]   cleaning their cars.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.260]   And I was like, "Hey dude, you guys have a cleaning lady?"
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.100]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.140]   I go, "Why don't you just ask the cleaning lady
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:20.980]   to clean the cars?"
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.740]   "Oh, geez, I don't know if we could do that."
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.300]   "Yeah, the woman who's cleaning your house
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.060]   obviously knows how to clean.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.860]   She drives a car.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.220]   Pretty sure she cleans her own car.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.340]   She probably wants more hours."
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.060]   It's so funny when we just start thinking of things
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.060]   through that lens of like, how do we put things together?
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.260]   And then the no touch side is the third principle.
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.900]   The no touch is kind of what we talked about,
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.140]   like using online, like Costco.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.340]   I don't go to grocery stores.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.380]   I don't buy stuff.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:52.020]   My whole rule is to the degree that I am not touching stuff.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.180]   That's how I want the world to work.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.060]   My brother, there was a point in his career,
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.780]   he's in the construction industry.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.980]   He's a home builder and whatnot.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.020]   He would probably spend two days a week,
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.940]   like 16 hours in his calendar,
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.940]   just bringing stuff around to people, okay?
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.300]   And this is not complicated stuff.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.060]   It's just driving.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.500]   And eventually I said, "You should hire a runner."
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.980]   So some people can't afford to do that.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.780]   I just want them to think about that.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:21.900]   It's a little work, Chris.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.260]   I could get somebody to do wash and fold,
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.740]   but I got to bring it to there, okay?
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.940]   But that's that company.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.700]   There's actually another company that will come to your house
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.580]   and pick it up and do wash and fold.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:31.620]   Oh, I didn't even know that.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.140]   Yeah, and it's an extra $6.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.100]   So is the $6 worth you saving 40 minutes there and back?
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.540]   Again, you do the buyback rate.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.740]   Yes, perfect.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.020]   Use a different service.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.580]   Some people are just not willing to ask.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.460]   I'll give you a real example.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.580]   Last year, Christmas time,
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.620]   I had my executive team in my hometown.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.900]   We did an offsite and I wanted to give them a gift.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.740]   So I called the store
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.220]   that I wanted to buy all the stuff from.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.100]   And I said, "Look, I need six gift bags put together,
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.420]   but I need you to deliver it."
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.460]   And they're like, "Well, we don't do that."
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.620]   And I go, "I know you don't do that.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.740]   And I totally understand why,
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.820]   but look, we're going to be at this restaurant.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.180]   And the only way this is going to work
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.740]   is if you guys can put it together,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.180]   bring it to the restaurant,
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.740]   have them put it behind the counter
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.380]   and just put it on my name.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.300]   And then when I show up, it's there."
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.220]   And I share that, Chris,
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.820]   because some people just would not even ask to do that.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.780]   And I said, "Look, if you need to charge me an extra 10%
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.060]   or whatever, please do it."
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.460]   But I knew the store where their location was
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.780]   and where the restaurant was walking distance.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.900]   It takes six minutes to just take the bag, bring it over.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.460]   They get a multi-hundred dollar order.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.780]   And I look like I'm super thoughtful and kind
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.700]   because I got them this cool bag
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.820]   that had their names on them.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.780]   I just think a lot of people just don't even ask.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.740]   They don't value their time enough
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.260]   to then ask people that have companies
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.780]   and would love more revenue to say like,
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.580]   "Hey, if you could do this and this, I'll pay you more.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.500]   You know what your buyback rate is."
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.340]   And a lot of them will just say, "Yes."
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.620]   It's like, "I actually drive by that neighborhood
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.660]   every day when I come home.
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.180]   So yeah, if you want me to drop it off."
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.700]   We did this with meal prep.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.140]   I remember eight years ago, my wife was freaking out
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.740]   because we have two young kids and I'm working.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.540]   I had a venture-backed company.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.740]   And I was just like, "You don't need to make dinner.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.340]   I love you and I know you want to make me food.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.020]   Not going to change my life if you're not the one cooking."
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.980]   And the way we did it is I was at the farmer's market.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.100]   There was this guy that we'd buy these frozen meals from.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.700]   And I was just like, "Hey, would you make these
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.900]   during the week and just drop them off at my house?"
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.980]   And he's like, "Well, we don't really do that."
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.980]   I go, "I know you don't really do that,
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.460]   but maybe you could start and I could be your first customer.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.740]   Here's where I live."
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.580]   I've even done it.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.900]   There was a meat guy I did the exact same thing with
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.340]   that I wanted him to deliver his meat.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.940]   Like you were saying, you're at a meat store earlier.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.380]   But he was like, "I don't really do that."
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.500]   And I said, "Well, what if you had six or seven people
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.580]   that you were delivering on at the same time?"
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.420]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.340]   And I go, "Cool."
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.540]   I just called my neighbors up and said,
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.420]   "Hey, are you guys willing to commit
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.020]   to this level of purchasing from this meat guy?
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.020]   You guys all know this store and you like it.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.060]   And if we do it, then he'll deliver it."
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.580]   And they were like, "Wow, you can get them to deliver it?"
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.700]   I'm like, "Yeah, no problem."
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.980]   I'm just a very resourceful, I ask,
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.700]   I'm creative about how I find ways to get my time back.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.020]   - It's funny you bring up the meat store.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.380]   There's this amazing meat store in Millbrae, California,
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.740]   near SFO called Pape Meat.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.460]   I learned this morning on the plaque on the wall,
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.100]   it's the oldest business in Millbrae.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.740]   And we needed a particular type of meat, guanciale,
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.940]   which is the meat you use for carbonara,
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.540]   which is what we're gonna make for Christmas Eve dinner.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.300]   - Oh, now you're making me hungry.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.620]   - And if you go to their website,
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.780]   they do not discuss delivery on the website.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.860]   There's not an easy way to get the meat.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.580]   However, this is all I had to do.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.820]   I searched deliver Pape Meat.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:47.020]   And this other website, Towne, T-O-W-N-E dot I-O,
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.020]   definitely some kind of startup,
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.420]   delivers for them.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.180]   Unfortunately, because it's Friday and I need it tomorrow,
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.900]   and it's the weekend and the holidays,
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.500]   that wasn't an option this day
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.340]   with my poor advanced planning.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.700]   But in general, I could have had it delivered,
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.260]   not because they did it.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.500]   And I'm sure if I called, they would have said,
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.140]   "Oh no, but this other website does it for us."
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.420]   So even just this year, "Oh, I need to order this thing.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.500]   "Let's just search to see if there is a service
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.580]   "out there that delivers."
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.380]   So I would just say, I now learn that there's this.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.580]   - Yeah, most people don't search.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.180]   - Don't assume that because their website
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.180]   doesn't say they deliver, doesn't mean they don't.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.900]   And obviously for restaurants,
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.780]   there's plenty of apps that we all know about,
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.820]   but there are alternatives like that.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.420]   We started using ButcherBox,
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.940]   which delivers actual meat
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.780]   and all kinds of stuff to your house.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.420]   So we get fresh meat
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.340]   and talking about two different services.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.020]   Sorry, Pape, we can't buy all my meat.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.020]   - No, and you're allowed to do that, right?
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.580]   You can use Instacart for certain things
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.380]   and you can use other services
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.900]   for like the weekly reoccurring.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.540]   It's really just being open
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.020]   to spending the time to figure it out.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.660]   I remember my buddy Nick was frustrated
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.380]   'cause he just bought this thing off some online site,
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:54.420]   this furniture showed up
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.780]   and then he's like frustrated 'cause he got put together.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:57.900]   And he literally was like,
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.300]   "I showed up just to say hi."
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   And I was like, "What are you doing?"
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.420]   'Cause this guy runs a successful business.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.620]   I'm putting together this furniture.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.060]   I'm like, "Why are you doing it?"
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.020]   He's like, "Oh man, I don't wanna sit down
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.060]   "and try to find the time to do the thing,
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.380]   "to find the person, to hire them.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.740]   "Like I might as well just do it myself."
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.140]   And I go, "Totally get it.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.260]   "In this circumstance, makes sense.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.780]   "But you need to consider the next time."
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.420]   So yes, the first time you do it,
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.860]   it's work to find a solution,
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.940]   but it's not that time you're actually trying to buy back.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.380]   It's the dozens of times this year
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.860]   that if you find a handyman or you use TaskRabbit
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.540]   or use whatever service,
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.220]   you find a trusted resource
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.820]   that you can pay to come and do those types of work.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:43.860]   Yeah, it's a little bit more work today,
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.900]   but down the road, then all of a sudden
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.540]   you have this list of resources where it becomes easier
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.140]   and you can even get it scheduled
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.620]   and part of your lifestyle.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.500]   Even the meal prep, I remember telling,
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.820]   again, I have a house manager,
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.060]   so I know I live a privileged life.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.820]   But if it was me, I would have done the same thing.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.580]   I went and found a nutritionist
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.940]   that partnered with a meal prep company
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:10.300]   so that they could take care of all of the food prep
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.700]   so that I would hit 99% of my time.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.420]   I'm hitting my macros, I'm hitting my nutrients,
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.300]   I'm hitting what I need for my health.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.740]   So it's like, some people look at that and they go like,
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.460]   I can't believe you're paying $16 a meal.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.020]   And I'm like, you don't realize how much time I'm saving
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.500]   and the compliance.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.660]   Like, this is the other thing is know thyself.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:32.380]   I don't want decision fatigue
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.260]   by deciding what I have to eat.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.540]   I want that taken care of for me
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.820]   so that I know I'm going to be healthy.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.020]   I know that the meal is made
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.340]   and it's going to hit all the macros
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.220]   that my trainer gave me and all these things.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:48.180]   And then that way I can take that decision power or energy
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:50.180]   and give it to something that's actually required.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.860]   It's why you see people like Zuckerberg
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.500]   wear the same clothes or Steve Jobs or all these people.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.620]   The more you can take the decisions out of your life,
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.100]   then the more energy and time you're going to have
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.900]   to actually create and produce more.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.860]   And that's another big part that people don't consider
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.660]   when you use these services
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.060]   is just you're freeing up your mental bandwidth.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:09.660]   I don't know about you,
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.500]   but I'm using the new year as an excuse
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.580]   to get fitness back in my routine.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.740]   And if you're going to work out,
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.100]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.620]   which I think is Viore,
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.500]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.940]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.940]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.300]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.020]   And it is so freaking comfortable
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.900]   you will want to wear it all the time.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.860]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.860]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.300]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.780]   And it's not just for men.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.320]   My wife, Amy, is just as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.260]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:48.240]   I have a few pairs,
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.100]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.380]   I've ever owned.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.540]   I also love my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.580]   Their products are incredibly versatile,
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.920]   and they can be used for just about any activity,
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.220]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.700]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.540]   or their Meta Pants can even work for a night out.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.620]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.940]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.540]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:19.340]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.980]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.980]   at allthehacks.com/viore.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:28.980]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i,
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.640]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.740]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.220]   (air whooshing)
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:38.180]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.460]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.020]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.180]   and my info as possible.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.020]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:51.180]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.180]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.420]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.380]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.580]   and instead of spending 50-plus hours
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.940]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.440]   it only took a few minutes,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.500]   because I used Delete.me from Abine,
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.300]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.540]   with them for this episode.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.320]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.620]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.400]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.500]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.160]   and get that removed as well.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.100]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.460]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.980]   in their first two years,
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.860]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.780]   for their customers.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.360]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.340]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.380]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:43.900]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.880]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.620]   I just wanna thank you, Quik,
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:52.920]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.740]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.460]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.220]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.780]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.100]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.420]   - You talk about your house manager.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.700]   I'd love to understand, just 'cause it's a concept
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.220]   I don't think everyone knows.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.860]   First, what that person does,
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.220]   and obviously I know it's probably a luxury
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.700]   and a privilege to have that,
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.340]   but I also wanna talk about ways
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.940]   that some of what they do might be things
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.340]   that people could start to put into place
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.140]   with a virtual assistant or something like that.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.420]   And for context, I've thought for years
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.900]   about whether I ever was gonna hire a virtual assistant.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.440]   I've been collecting tasks over the last few months
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.380]   that would've been great opportunities to outsource
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.620]   that any individual one was not big enough
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:46.500]   for me to say, oh, let's go hire a person
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.700]   so that, for example, one was,
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.020]   we were thinking of doing a gingerbread baking party,
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.740]   like where we'd make a bunch of gingerbread cookies,
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.620]   have people over, and it's like, oh,
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.180]   it'd be really great if someone wants to find a recipe,
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.860]   figure out how to batch it for 30 people,
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.140]   go on Amazon Fresh, order all the ingredients,
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.860]   and have them delivered.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.820]   It would probably not take that long, maybe half an hour.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.460]   I would probably take me even longer
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.860]   'cause I'm sure I would try to get caught up
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.220]   on what is the absolute best gingerbread recipe,
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.460]   and the average person would probably not spend
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.340]   as much time as I would,
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.300]   so it'd probably save me even more time.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.180]   But I wasn't gonna go hire a virtual assistant
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.300]   for that one task, so maybe talk to me
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.780]   about the house manager and whether you think
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.620]   a virtual assistant could take on a lot of that
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.760]   and whether that's something regular people,
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.540]   at the low cost you can get them now should be considering.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.060]   - I'll start with the administrative assistant type of task
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.860]   because that's super approachable, right?
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.500]   Like we live in a world where there are services out there,
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.180]   if you search like virtual assistant,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.300]   task management, et cetera, where you can pay per task
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:49.380]   or by the hour, the 15 to $20 type range,
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.300]   or hire somebody in another part of the world
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.980]   for $4, $5, $6 an hour.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:59.960]   It is absolutely approachable for every person out there
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.320]   in the world we live in because there's these like companies
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.020]   that have built this technology.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:07.680]   The key though is to actually do the calendar audit
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.100]   to find out what are you doing with your time
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.580]   that is more administrative in nature that is repeatable?
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.720]   'Cause what I want to encourage people to consider
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.160]   is find the cadence of repeatable tasks
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.020]   that you can insert a person into your life,
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.020]   then they're available to do the things
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.220]   you just talked about, Chris.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.560]   If I have to think of finding another person
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.900]   to do a one-off thing, that feels heavy.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.500]   If I already have somebody in my life
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.860]   that's working five hours a week for me,
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:39.000]   managing research projects or buying stuff online
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.080]   or scheduling my travel or taking information
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.820]   from this system and putting in this system,
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.940]   like every person that has a job
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.580]   probably does some type of work
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.700]   that isn't really rocket science
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.460]   and you could just give to somebody else.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.100]   Sometimes it's just collecting data,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.800]   it's putting stuff in a graph,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.540]   it's post-production of social media stuff
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.380]   or whatever it is.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.540]   Then you start with the reoccurring things
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.900]   or the person's part of your life
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.020]   and then you can give them the one-off stuff.
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.460]   The way I've always looked at it
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.920]   and what I teach in my book is
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.940]   I always start with the calendar first
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:15.260]   because that's where I'm going to start buying back time
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.700]   and in the early days, it's usually task-based.
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:19.060]   A lot of the stuff we talked about
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.500]   from lawn service to cleaning, wash and fold,
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.980]   meal prep, project management, it's all task-based
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.620]   and that's okay, you just start there
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.420]   and you have five or six different people
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.020]   doing different types of tasks
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.440]   and then eventually you say, "You know what?
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.820]   I don't want somebody separate cleaning my car
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:36.660]   and cleaning my house,
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.420]   I'm just gonna have one person do that."
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.860]   And you kind of consolidate.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.820]   So if you think at like the lowest level,
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.660]   every person listening to this,
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.060]   start with a budget,
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.100]   challenge yourself to buy back some time
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.020]   and just know that you can have two or three people
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.660]   supporting you in different services or whatever.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.980]   And then what happens over time
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.780]   is you realize that there's a communication overhead,
[00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.220]   a management overhead of managing these things.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.620]   And that's what happened for us.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:05.940]   We had the house cleaner, we had the chef,
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.860]   we had the lawn care people,
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.860]   we had all these different people supporting our home.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.660]   And then when I looked at my calendar,
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.940]   because my wife and I both run companies,
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.180]   I realized like there's a lot of work I was doing
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.860]   of just managing stuff.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.300]   Like I'm talking about going to the DMV
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.980]   and registering cars and calling my insurance company
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.820]   and maintenance on our homes
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.300]   and just transferring vehicles,
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.780]   literally everything, putting boats in storage.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.940]   I understand how privileged of a life that I have,
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.580]   but these are things that were still on my plate to do.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.620]   So on Saturday morning,
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.180]   instead of going mountain biking with my friends
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.060]   or deciding to say yes to putting our kids into soccer,
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.060]   I'm doing all this other stuff.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.740]   And sometimes I just wanna recharge.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.140]   I wanna sit down, I wanna read.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.700]   I wanna work on supporting our community.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.140]   My wife and I are very involved
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.780]   in the unhomed community in our city.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.860]   I'd rather go do that than manage a spreadsheet
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.020]   of making sure that we have the right insurance
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.500]   on all of our assets.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.380]   So we got to a place where we just decided to hire somebody
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:13.980]   that was the CEO of all of our personal stuff.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.380]   Now, again, I've had an executive assistant for a long time,
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.900]   for almost 10 years,
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.740]   but that person doesn't live in our home
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.740]   and is not in our home and not doing personal stuff.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.780]   They're managing the business side of my life.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.700]   Task purchasing, travels, all that stuff.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.900]   Inbox calendar.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.540]   Then we essentially rolled up
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.540]   all of the other stuff to one person.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.980]   And now we have one person.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.500]   She's incredible.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.340]   And we set up a rhythm
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.020]   where every Monday I have lunch with her.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.020]   We talk about the week.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.980]   We talk about the task.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.860]   We're eating together.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.780]   So it takes no time for me.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.540]   Every Wednesday, my wife and I,
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.180]   my executive assistant and her get on a Zoom call.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.500]   We call it the house meeting.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.060]   And we review, we have an agenda.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.500]   We review the projects.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.260]   We review what they're working on, the playbooks.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.580]   And Chris is kind of crazy about it.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.900]   I have an SOP.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.940]   I have a playbook, handbook for the Martell family.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.100]   And in there is...
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.940]   What does that mean?
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.100]   Yeah, walk me through what that looks like.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:05.940]   It's awesome.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.780]   It's everything.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.380]   It's who are our babysitters.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.540]   It's the names of the people.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:16.420]   That's the kids, school, principal, contact info, the vet.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.100]   Think about all the contacts.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.500]   So that's all in there.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.900]   All of our preferences, all in there.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.380]   Size of my shoes, my favorite colors for a T-shirt.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.220]   It's kind of crazy.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.900]   Even just the preference file,
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.380]   where I like to sit on a plane, all these things.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.740]   Then I never have to make the decision again.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.140]   You ever register for an event
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.580]   and they ask you the same questions every time?
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:35.620]   I don't do that anymore.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.900]   My assistant or my house manager asks us once
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.060]   and then she writes it down.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.980]   Everything is in a Google document, right?
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.540]   I think we're moving everything to Notion right now.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.380]   Even the...
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.140]   So we have a pretty cool sauna that does infrared
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.060]   and salt therapy and all these things.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.100]   And it's got a procedure
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.340]   for like how to schedule it to turn it on,
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.620]   how to reconnect the red light system.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:01.580]   And it's all in the playbook so that if I need to do it
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.300]   because it's a Sunday morning,
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.140]   I literally Google sauna and I find the playbook
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.620]   and I go to the section where it says,
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.660]   reset the red light system.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.980]   And I follow seven different steps to reset.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.180]   Like it's all in there.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.180]   Logins are all in one password
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.420]   and it's all under the house vault.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.620]   So it's like, I'm in my backyard
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.660]   and I need to get into a door that's got a lock.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.700]   We change all of our locks to pins, like an Airbnb.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.820]   Why? Mobile.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.660]   Remember I said that?
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.500]   It's gotta go mobile.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.580]   So all the locks are all mobile enabled
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.900]   and all the numbers and the codes are all in one password.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.420]   And it's literally, we've created this kind of like
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.700]   procedure for our life.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.860]   Again, Chris, I'm sharing this
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.260]   'cause I wanna inspire people.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.260]   I also know I may infuriate people.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.660]   Like when you show people some of the super cars
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.020]   and a lifestyle and flying,
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:47.860]   like all this stuff,
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.100]   they can either be inspired by it
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.700]   or they're gonna be like, this guy's a douche.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.220]   And I totally get it.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.740]   I'm sharing this to hopefully inspire people
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.820]   that there is ways for you to incorporate this
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.700]   into your personal life
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.420]   that allow you to increase the quality of life you have.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.380]   And most importantly, create jobs.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.380]   A lot of my clients that struggle with this,
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.500]   that don't feel worthy of having somebody
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.620]   to that level of support.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.900]   I just tell them, look, you can go buy,
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.180]   'cause this is what they're doing, Chris.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.060]   They're going and buying the new Mercedes or the new BMW.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.500]   I watch them do it all the time.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.620]   My neighbors, I watch them do it.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.260]   The new car comes out, they went and bought it, okay?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.900]   Or you could stop complaining about not having enough time.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.860]   And instead of buying the new version,
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.260]   just keep the current one for a couple of years,
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.460]   hire somebody to manage your life
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.300]   so that you have the time to recharge
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.260]   or go increase the value in the market
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.260]   to pay three times over the new car.
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.620]   It's so fascinating for me to watch,
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.580]   even in my world, friends of mine
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.420]   that struggle with their time
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.860]   and yet they don't understand
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.420]   where they're allocating their resources, their money.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.580]   So pretty much, if it would show up on my wife
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:02.580]   or my to-do list, it is owned by our house manager, Betty.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.820]   And we tell her all the time, you are the CEO of our lives.
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.540]   We do not manage our things.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.780]   You manage them, you create the playbooks,
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.140]   you take care of schedules and cadences
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.820]   and assets and relationships and all that stuff.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.860]   And then we just create a reporting structure
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:21.980]   where we get the information we need on a weekly basis
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.180]   to keep us informed so we feel like nothing's getting dropped.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.540]   So it's no different than you would
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.980]   for an executive assistant in your business life.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.700]   You just do the same thing for your personal life.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.420]   And it all evolved from having a bunch of individual things.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:37.020]   You start small, yes.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.460]   It's funny, two things came up.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.220]   One, I've been pushing,
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.460]   there's a company called Trustworthy that I invested in,
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.100]   which is kind of building the family operating system.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.500]   And it started as like the central repository
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.140]   of all the information about your life.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.540]   So here's our house, here's our bank accounts.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.220]   And if I were ever to pass away,
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.100]   I have my sister and another person
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:58.020]   set to be able to access it, they know.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.980]   But now they've started adding things like,
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.420]   for our house, here's our landscaping company,
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.700]   or here's our internet service provider or something.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.900]   So they're building a software alternative
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.780]   to Notion or Google Doc for this.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.500]   I love it, because most people don't know
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.460]   what information they should be collecting.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.300]   So their coolest thing is when you onboard,
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.020]   they're like, all right, go put in your old tax returns.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:18.860]   All of it.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.140]   Go link your bank accounts.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.980]   Here's your insurance policies.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.380]   And for your benefit, they have a mobile app.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.500]   So Amy and I know that if we're at the doctor's office
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.300]   and they're like, where's your kid's insurance card?
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.940]   We know, open the Trustworthy app,
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.820]   here's the insurance card.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.060]   We get pulled over, show me your proof of insurance,
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.380]   open the app, here's our Geico card.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.220]   We know where all of the things are.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.420]   Dude, it's crazy.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.740]   Think about how much time you're saved.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.100]   Like the other day, we had our meeting on Wednesday
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.180]   this week and one of the projects
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.900]   was get my wife's passport renewed.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:50.300]   Do you know how many of my friends end up at the airport
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.820]   and their passport's expired
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:55.020]   and they can't go on a trip or miss a speaking gig?
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.100]   It's bananas.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:56.940]   And why?
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.620]   Because they feel like I'm supposed to manage this.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.460]   It's my life.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.280]   I need to manage my life.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.820]   It's like, when you actually give it to somebody else
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.900]   and you say, please treat me like a child,
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.060]   I am okay with that.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.180]   'Cause that's literally what I tell her.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:12.060]   I'm like, I want you to just assume
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.940]   that I'm not that intelligent
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:18.180]   and I want you to track the stuff, everything.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:22.020]   And you tell me when it's due or just do it
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.860]   and we'll build a rhythm for communication reporting
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.900]   so that I know, and then that way it's all there.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.220]   And like all that stuff you said,
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.820]   like the insurance, your wills,
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.940]   it's essentially like creating,
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.560]   in a high net worth individual,
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.380]   they'll usually have like a family office.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.060]   You're creating the infrastructure
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.300]   for your own like personal family office for your life.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.260]   Even having a shared one password vault
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.340]   for your family's wifi logins
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:52.020]   and other online services is just a good idea.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.140]   I feel like you would absolutely love the product.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:54.980]   I'm checking it out.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.860]   I wrote it down, yeah.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.220]   I'm looking at it right now
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.500]   and it says, renew driver's license.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.300]   Because I already gave them my driver's license info.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.780]   It says, trustworthy will alert you 120 days
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.540]   before your driver's license expires.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.380]   Renew passport.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.940]   Trustworthy will alert you nine months
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.180]   before your passport expires.
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.940]   So by putting the information in,
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.340]   you get this reward of like,
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.060]   hey, passport's expiring in nine months.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.180]   I don't have to think about it anymore.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.380]   I know that for all of our kids,
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.500]   I'm gonna get an alert nine months
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.140]   before any of those passports expire.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.460]   It relieves the mental burden of me having to think about.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.660]   This is an example of because you're on the journey
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.740]   to try to find ways to buy back your time
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.180]   and you look at like where you've had friction in the past
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.460]   and you found a service like this.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.500]   So some people might hear about the house manager
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.420]   and go like, that's crazy.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.100]   I could never afford that.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.300]   Think about there's tools out there.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.620]   30% of what she does, the software automates it.
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.460]   And I talked about that.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.460]   It's like automation.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.180]   I just feel like people need to really challenge themselves
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.860]   to value their time, to go on the journey, to build it.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.140]   Yeah, it takes work.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.340]   I'll actually give a real tactical thing for people
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:00.060]   if they're still like on the edge and they haven't done it.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.300]   This guy, Jack Canfield,
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.780]   he wrote a ton of bestselling books, bestselling author,
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:05.100]   like good dude.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.580]   He talked about creating this thing
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.060]   called the frustration list, 'cause it's a muscle.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:14.060]   And his argument was most people don't even see frustrations
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:16.140]   in their world to see opportunities.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.140]   It's a muscle you have to develop.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.220]   And his argument was like,
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.940]   as you go through your day in your home,
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.580]   think about things that frustrate you, okay?
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.620]   And just make the list.
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.820]   I'm not asking you to solve the problem, just make a list.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.820]   So it might be I'm downstairs working out
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.660]   and I don't have a cable to charge my phone.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.300]   Literally, just write it down.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.860]   Like don't have a cable to charge my phone.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.140]   Or you get in your car and you realize you ran out of gum
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.380]   and you like this certain type of gum and it's not there.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.220]   Okay, write it down.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.020]   Or it's like, you get out of the shower
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.860]   and you don't have a hook for your towel after you dry off.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.460]   It sounds crazy, Chris,
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:55.300]   but I want people to do that for like two or three days
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.100]   because two things, one, honor those frustrations
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.820]   and build a muscle and a routine of solving those problems.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.220]   Make the list and actually wake up on Saturday morning
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.100]   and say, hey, I'm gonna work through this list
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.380]   and just see if I can be creative
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.700]   about how I solve this stuff.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.940]   Some of it could be simple, like buy another truck.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.260]   And even that, it sounds so nuts, dude.
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.060]   People won't even give themselves permission
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.580]   to own two cable chargers for their iPhone.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.420]   So there's one next to their bed and one in their office.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.300]   Like, isn't it weird, Chris, that they're like,
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.900]   yeah, no, I don't deserve that.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.780]   If anyone listening feels they don't deserve it,
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.620]   I think I have like 20 extra iPhone chargers in my house.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.900]   I will gladly send you one.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.180]   Of course, because you're like,
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.980]   hey, I wanna have the things that I need
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.940]   and I'm willing to pay for extra stuff
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.340]   so that it doesn't become a point of contention
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   because what's worse is if you're in,
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.860]   like I do some backcountry skiing.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.860]   If I'm in trouble and my phone is dead
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.140]   because I didn't charge it when I should have charged it,
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.620]   that's a bad circumstance.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.060]   So I just really wanna encourage people to realize
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.300]   that if it doesn't feel natural to you right now
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.780]   to identify things in your life
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.060]   that you should be trying to buy back your time on,
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.500]   it's a muscle that can be developed
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.180]   by just writing down the things
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.420]   that are frustrating or not optimal.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.820]   Some of you guys are like, I love life.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.780]   That's not a frustration.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.980]   Look, just in a perfect world, wave a magic wand.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.140]   If you could live a perfect life
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.780]   and you go through life and everything's awesome,
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.620]   how would it look?
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:17.540]   Make that list and try to create that.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.380]   Love it.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.420]   We've gone through a lot.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.740]   However, there are a few random things
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.500]   that I want to touch on before we go.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.340]   I think next year will be the year
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.140]   that I get started with trying to actually hire someone
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.500]   to help outsource a lot of these tasks.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.620]   I need to hire a virtual assistant
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.100]   to help me go research the best virtual assistant services.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.740]   I'm not ready for someone full-time yet,
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.860]   but there are a few things that as I've listened to you talk
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.900]   and as I've done my homework and just known you,
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.380]   that you've done that I think maybe don't fall
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.580]   exactly perfectly into buying back your time
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:46.900]   and the conversation we just had,
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.260]   but I think are worth running through
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.700]   because I think people will find a lot of value out of them.
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.340]   One is on designing your perfect week.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.220]   One is on thinking about the seven pillars of life
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.220]   and let's start there and then I'll get to the rest.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.060]   Cool.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:11:59.900]   The perfect week.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.140]   And I actually have a diagram in my book
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:02.980]   that I put in there
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.220]   'cause I wanted people to actually see
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.860]   what that looks like for me.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.860]   I think it's on page 141.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.420]   It's literally the diagram.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:15.420]   What's important is to design all the big rocks
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.540]   into your life so that you actually understand
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.060]   that you do have the capacity.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.460]   A lot of people go like, "I don't have the time."
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   That's cool.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.780]   Let's talk about that.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.940]   But let's just start by saying,
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.820]   okay, here's a seven-day template I give people.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.300]   They buy the book, they go to the website
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.740]   and I give them the template.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.540]   Then they make a list of all the important things
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   in their life, like spending time with their kids,
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.260]   going to the gym, their work, their creative stuff,
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.860]   their hobbies or whatever.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.660]   And then you take that and you put it into the calendar
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.020]   and you like block them in.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.740]   The big stuff, it's like go to the gym every day.
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.580]   What time do you wanna go?
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.580]   It's an hour or 90 minutes, put it in there.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.140]   And what I think people realize
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.780]   if they go through the exercise
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.580]   is there is actually enough time in a week
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.660]   to do everything you want to do.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:03.140]   You just have to now then honor the calendar.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:06.940]   And the reason why I encourage all of my coaching clients
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.740]   to do this is because if you have the rhythm
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.260]   of your week designed, then when you hire somebody
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.860]   like a virtual assistant to support you,
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.500]   they know where certain things go
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.940]   so they don't have to bug you.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.620]   It actually is not efficient, Chris,
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.340]   if you have somebody that's managing your inbox
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.180]   and your calendar and helping you
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.660]   with scheduling meetings and stuff
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.140]   to have to ask you every time,
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.540]   "Hey, are you okay doing a meeting
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.540]   at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon?"
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.700]   Versus, "Hey, these are the two hour windows
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.140]   each day that I do meetings.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.500]   So if a meeting comes in, just put it there."
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.340]   I'll just give you like an advanced tip on that
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.820]   for a virtual assistant.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.860]   We do three levels of priority.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:48.420]   So I'll sometimes do a P1, P2, P3 in the email reply.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.980]   A P1 means cancel something to make it happen
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:53.180]   at priority level.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:56.500]   P2 is make it fit as soon as possible,
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.100]   but don't cancel anything.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.900]   P3 is within the next two weeks.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.060]   And P4 is don't rush.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.340]   If it happens, cool.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.700]   If it doesn't, no harm, no foul.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.340]   Even just trying to create these systems and language
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:13.060]   around how you work with somebody to manage your calendar
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.620]   is important, but it all starts
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.980]   with designing the perfect week.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.980]   Does that make sense?
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:21.260]   Yeah, I was just actually thinking about some way
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:24.140]   that you could secretly encode that into your email
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.020]   so you reply to someone.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.060]   Here's how I do it.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.900]   I leave an email draft and I write it in the draft
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.060]   so she sees it 'cause she's in my inbox.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:33.900]   Ah. Yeah.
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.100]   Yeah, if someone's in your inbox,
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.420]   all my head could think about was like,
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:39.620]   "Oh, what if I had this secret code where I had a signature
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.020]   and if I end it with an exclamation point?"
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.660]   Looking forward to hanging out.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.340]   So you could do signature, enter,
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.300]   and put it right at the bottom and nobody even sees it.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.300]   Or different, like you're onto the same pattern
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.340]   of the language.
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.340]   So it's like, "Can't wait to meet" means this.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.260]   "Looking forward to talking soon"
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:58.020]   means you can add that as a language signature.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.620]   It was superhuman they have these snippets.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.020]   So that snippet could be called P1.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.620]   I know that I just write P1
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.740]   and then it posts this line that means...
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:06.580]   Boom.
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.420]   I love it.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   The seven pillars of life.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.260]   Talk about it.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.100]   Seven pillars of life is a way
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:14.660]   that I create a feedback loop for myself
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:17.180]   on how I'm showing up in my life
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:21.860]   and at least creating a point of reflection to improve it.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.980]   And the reason why I designed this is a long time ago,
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:28.700]   I went through a challenging time with my fiance
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.940]   and that didn't work out.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.140]   But then I got married and I don't know about you,
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.420]   but people get divorced and it's kind of crazy.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.180]   And you're just like, "Why do they get divorced?
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.780]   Why are they having challenges in their lives?"
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:42.460]   And typically it's because there's a fracture
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:45.020]   and then the fracture lasts for weeks
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.860]   and then months and then eventually a year.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.980]   And the fracture ends up creating such a wide divide
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.980]   that they can't repair it.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   So what I've done is across these seven core pillars,
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.540]   it's actually a bonus chapter.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.820]   I wasn't even gonna include in the book
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.540]   and my editor was like, "Hey, I really think
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.020]   the seven pillars would be a great tool
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.220]   for everybody to just wrap it all up."
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:08.140]   And every Friday morning, I sit down for 30 minutes.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.420]   It doesn't even take me 30 minutes.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.220]   It takes me like five or six.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:14.220]   But I rate myself out of 10 on these seven pillars.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.060]   It's a spreadsheet.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.580]   I've been doing it for years.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:20.540]   And the seven categories are health, hobbies,
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:25.540]   spirituality, friends, love, finance, and mission.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.540]   And I do those ones because they encompass
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.780]   kind of like how I wanna show up in the world.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.900]   Spirituality is important.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.140]   It doesn't matter if you believe in God
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:35.260]   or whatever God or the universal consciousness
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.740]   or spirit or energy, whatever it is.
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.540]   Just asking yourself, do you have a relationship?
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.860]   Are you spiritual?
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.020]   Are you meditating?
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:43.860]   Whatever it is.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.180]   And just giving yourself a rating on those things.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:48.380]   Finances, like a lot of people,
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.660]   they don't wanna talk about money.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.060]   They don't pay attention to their money.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.780]   And then they wonder why they have none.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.260]   Or like hobbies.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.740]   People are like, "Oh, hobbies must be nice."
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:57.980]   It's like, look, all I know is that
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.820]   after I go snowboarding with my buddies,
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.140]   I'm a better dad, I'm a better husband.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.620]   I recharge, I connect.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.620]   I wanna do those things.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.980]   So what happens is I score myself on those seven pillars.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.820]   I'll actually give you today's.
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:11.140]   That's always better real time.
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.940]   So today I scored myself pretty high.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.460]   I'm having a good time right now.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.660]   My two lowest scores,
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.180]   one was friends and the other one was hobby.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.660]   So here's the bonus one of this.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.180]   I got an eight and a seven.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:25.620]   I always write in the spreadsheet a note on how to fix it.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.940]   So the hobby one is book snow biking.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:30.660]   So I do this crazy thing called snow biking.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.500]   And then the friends one is low,
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.340]   but the good news is I go snow biking with my friends.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.180]   So I'm gonna get a double whammy.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.260]   And all I did, the action,
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:40.300]   that's why I give myself 30 minutes to do this.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.980]   I just made a list of all the dates
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.540]   that I'm free to go snow biking.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.900]   And then I sent a text message to my five friends
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.260]   that I go snow biking with and says,
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.300]   "Hey guys, can we just schedule
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.660]   one of these days to go snow biking?"
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.820]   And I've accomplished it.
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.940]   Literally, it's that simple.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.940]   It's just every week I assess myself
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.460]   on those seven dimensions.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.380]   I take my two lowest scores.
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.460]   If it's love, 'cause I haven't been there for my wife,
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.940]   it might be, then I set a commitment to take action
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.220]   in the next seven days.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.820]   And that one might be like schedule a date night,
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:10.300]   give my wife night off on Monday, let her take a bath,
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.140]   whatever it is.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.380]   And because I do that, Chris,
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.820]   I just feel like I get to live a higher quality of life
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.540]   because I'm not trying to fix things
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:19.340]   because there's a fracture that's been going on
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.420]   way too long around not seeing my friends
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.740]   or not taking care of my health
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.380]   or not focusing on my mission or whatever it is.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.620]   And it's been a big part of my life.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.460]   - I love it.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.900]   And on the topic of relationships,
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.140]   the last thing I wanted to chat about,
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.060]   you hired a coach to live with you
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:37.780]   and help the family and build deeper relationships.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.220]   For those of us who aren't gonna do that right away
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.460]   or it's not in the budget,
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.820]   what lessons did you take away
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.140]   that maybe we could steal from you?
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:44.980]   - So many.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.980]   Her name is Brooke.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.460]   She is a angel.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.980]   We've been working with her for three years.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:51.420]   I'm just a big fan of like hiring people
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.180]   to increase the caliber of our life in different areas,
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.580]   from fitness to business to our family.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.780]   We got to the point where Brooke and I,
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.580]   it's fun because she'll have private calls with my wife
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.620]   and she'll have private calls with me
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.980]   and then we'll do a group call.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.500]   But it got to a place where I was like,
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.220]   I think there's another level of opportunity,
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.580]   but I think you'd have to like see us instead of hear us.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.580]   'Cause you think about it, Chris,
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.740]   it's like explaining to somebody what happened
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.140]   is like you recounting the situation.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.900]   It was always like their version, your version,
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:21.780]   and then the truth.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.820]   Versus them being in the room, seeing it,
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.300]   and then they get to get their interpretation.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.940]   So I literally offered to fly her up.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.020]   She lived in California.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.580]   She came and lived with us for three days.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.100]   She like slept in our house, lived in our home,
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.420]   woke up in the morning, watched the morning routine.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.060]   So it was really fun to have her get a new level of insight
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:44.580]   into what all the conversations we were having
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.060]   meant in a real world scenario.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.860]   The things that I learned personally
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.500]   was she did some incredible work with my wife
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.660]   around reconnecting with her feminine.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.820]   You'd have to ask my wife about like the impact
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.500]   it had on her, but I got to see it.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.260]   She did some dancing when she asked, she invited me.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.420]   She's like, do you want to do it with us?
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.300]   And I'm like, I'm here to play full out.
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.180]   So 7 a.m. instead of going to the gym,
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.700]   I sat down and I danced with my wife and Brooke
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.780]   and it was pretty crazy, man.
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.420]   Just like understanding how women's physiology
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.980]   and their feminine side of their connection
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.940]   is just part of it.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.780]   It's kind of crazy.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.620]   It's not what men do.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.780]   Men scream and charge off into war.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:24.380]   And again, it's masculine versus feminine.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.940]   It's not even a gender thing, but that was a big takeaway.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:29.340]   She worked with our kids.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.700]   So she did some exercises with our kids
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.140]   to understand the way they were building their worldview.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.620]   And what was important to them.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.180]   So she made them draw a picture of their family.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:41.100]   You kind of see this in therapy sometimes,
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.220]   but then we had some issues, dude.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:44.060]   It was really cool.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.140]   Like my oldest son had a meltdown.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.940]   So she got to see how we responded to it
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.740]   and then gave us some cues.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.780]   She explained to my wife that these things are 100% normal.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.980]   So it allowed her to feel less guilty
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.700]   about those things happening.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.340]   If you don't have an external perspective,
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:01.820]   you sometimes think like, this is the end of the world
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.780]   and I'm such a bad parent because this is happening.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.340]   Having an expert come in and say,
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.140]   oh, actually that's super normal.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.420]   You handled that really well.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.340]   Here's why.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:12.540]   And in the future, if you want a little bit of coaching,
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.420]   do this.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.260]   For me personally, sounds crazy.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.900]   I learned that my wife likes to tell me about her day,
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.380]   not because I'm going to have a test at the end of it.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.260]   So I have to remember everything,
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:28.260]   but just because it's her way of decompressing
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.060]   at the end of the day.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:33.140]   So this was a huge win for me
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.140]   because I now prompt it.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.020]   Where before I was scared of it,
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.100]   'cause I was like, oh my gosh,
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.980]   she's going to sit there and talk for 20 minutes
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:42.540]   and I don't know, am I supposed to help?
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:43.540]   Am I not supposed to help?
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.100]   Why is she telling me all this stuff?
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.220]   And now I go, hey babes, tell me about your day.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:49.900]   This is literally the last thing we do every night
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.180]   because Brooke explained to me what was happening
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.060]   and that I'm not going to be tested
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.500]   and I'm not supposed to do anything other than listen.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.380]   So I will tell you, it might sound simple
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.100]   for some of you men out there,
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.260]   you will be the best husband in the world
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.540]   if you say, hey babes, tell me about your day.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.220]   Wow, that sounds tough.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.220]   Tell me more.
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:15.700]   Literally that language, tell me more, game changer.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.100]   So that was big.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.900]   And then just really how to show up for your partner.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.300]   Some like physical things.
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.860]   Like a lot of women, they want to feel safe.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:24.780]   They want to feel seen.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.300]   They want to feel appreciated.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.540]   That was a big thing.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.540]   This one that I think my wife really took away
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.220]   is men hate to be criticized.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:35.140]   I don't know if you've ever had your wife criticize you
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.620]   or do it in front of another person.
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.260]   There's certain things that are just like
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.020]   for whatever reason is really challenging.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.260]   Once she saw it and got some cues on it,
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.820]   it just changed the way we show up in public.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.260]   We worked on this, there's a book,
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.100]   I can't remember the name of it.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.180]   This is another big one and I'll leave on this one
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.380]   is launchings and landings, okay?
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:56.740]   So she taught us the value of a launching a land.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.780]   I'm so driven by time as you guys can all hopefully pick up
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.020]   that I'll just like run out the door.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.780]   It's like, I'm leaving, going to the gym.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.460]   I just ran out the door.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.460]   She said the two most important things
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.900]   you have to get better at as a couple
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.460]   is launchings and landings.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.660]   Meaning that when you leave,
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.380]   it is a deliberate go find the partner.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:16.740]   Hey, I'm leaving now.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.820]   I'm going to do this.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.500]   I will see you when I get back.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.580]   And then when you land, it's I'm back.
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.060]   Here's what I did.
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.620]   Do you need me for anything?
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.340]   And it might sound crazy.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.980]   We actually taught it to our kids.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.660]   Even before I come into my office in the morning,
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.380]   'cause I have a home office,
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.100]   I go and I do a launch with my kids
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.260]   where I give them little kisses and I tell them about them
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.380]   and say, I'm going to my office now, da, da, da, da, da.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.300]   And then we call it a launch.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.060]   And then when I get back or at the end of the day,
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.700]   if I'm done early, I like go find them and I land with them.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.580]   I like, hey, I'm done, da, da, da, da.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:48.900]   And they actually say like, I'm launching too.
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.900]   And they'll tell us about them going to do stuff.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.660]   So I just think it's those little tweaks, right?
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:56.340]   In life, it's never about like these big moves.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:59.500]   It's these one degree, these two degree changes.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.300]   And then when you follow that trend line
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.900]   over five, 10, 25 years,
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.700]   they have these huge pieces of impact on your life.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.700]   - So two things I took away, no Irish exits in the house.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.740]   That's for parties only.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.420]   But also I've just learned to get better
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.180]   about communicating.
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.700]   Sometimes there's a person in a relationship
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.420]   that takes the mental burden
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.620]   of everything that has to happen.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.780]   And if you don't communicate that you're doing something,
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.980]   they feel like it's their responsibility to do it.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:27.420]   So for me, if I don't say,
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:29.940]   hey, I am still planning on doing X,
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.460]   my wife might assume, oh, maybe you're not gonna do it.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.420]   - Emotional shrapnel saved.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.020]   - All right, we went through a lot.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.100]   We're way over time.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.780]   I got an advanced copy of the book.
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:39.620]   So I've already read it,
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:41.940]   even though by the time anyone listening is listening,
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:42.780]   it will be out.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.180]   I highly recommend, you've got three on your bookshelf.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.100]   I was like, I'm gonna maybe have a bookshelf
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:47.940]   in this new studio.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.620]   Now I need to go get a physical copy.
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.980]   I only read the digital copy.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.860]   But definitely tell everyone where they can find it,
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.260]   who it's for and everything,
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.300]   and where they can find you.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.020]   - Yeah, book is designed for people
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.780]   that obviously wanna become better time trader.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:04.100]   It's called "Buy Back Your Time", buybackyourtime.com.
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.780]   It's available on Amazon.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.620]   If anything I shared today serves you
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.260]   and you end up getting the book or whatnot,
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.180]   I would love, love, love a review on Amazon.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.580]   I'm working with my team to create a movement
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:17.220]   around business and executive level performance
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.620]   and just really help people understand
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.860]   how to build a life they don't grow to hate.
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:24.540]   That's like my biggest thing, Chris.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.420]   I just don't want people to go after
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.340]   this achievement lifestyle or this success ladder
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.380]   to just find it leaning against the wrong wall
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.340]   because they just don't know how to think
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.740]   about the energy and the time
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.780]   and just getting more of their life.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.580]   So that's why I created it.
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:43.940]   It's been two and a half years of love and sweat
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:47.340]   and frustrations and just putting everything into it.
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.100]   Yeah, I'm really proud of the book
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.500]   and the hardcover is cool and I'll tell you why, Chris,
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.540]   if you get a copy, you should get the physical copy.
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.580]   I actually got my signature.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:56.860]   Take the jacket cover off.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.540]   I designed the whole, like people never see this stuff,
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.580]   but I cared about it and I'm really proud of it.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   But yeah, buybackyourtime.com.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.420]   Awesome, and what about you?
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.300]   Where can people find you on the internet?

[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.620]   (electronic beeping)
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:54.740]   (electronic buzzing)
