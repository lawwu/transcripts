[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.040]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.880]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.360]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.080]   I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.400]   to help you get the best experience in life.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680]   And one of those things is managing time.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.840]   And time management guru, Laura Vanderkam,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.360]   who I've had on the show before,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.200]   has a new book called "Tranquility" by Tuesday.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.260]   I thought it was a good book that offered nine rules
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.940]   to help people spend more time on what matters.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.560]   But there was one expression in the book
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.860]   that really stuck out with me.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.140]   We should all be time millionaires.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.980]   And that sounds great,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.340]   even better than being a money millionaire maybe.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.500]   But how does it happen?
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380]   People can't just create more time in their day
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.520]   unlike money, so what's the secret?
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.180]   And that's where today's guest can help.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.640]   His name's Dan Martell.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.140]   He's a good longtime friend of mine
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.100]   and he has a new book about just this.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.540]   It's called "Buy Back Your Time, Get Unstuck,
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540]   "Reclaim Your Freedom and Build Your Empire."
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.780]   In his years as a successful entrepreneur,
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.300]   after a rough childhood and a few run-ins with the law,
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.180]   he built five companies, sold three of them,
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.220]   and currently runs SaaS Academy,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.900]   the world's largest coaching program
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.700]   for founders of software as a service businesses.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.300]   But you don't have to have founded a business
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.540]   to apply these principles.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.840]   We're gonna talk about why buying back time
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.460]   has become his superpower,
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.620]   why mindset is such a key part of buying back time,
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.320]   how anyone can learn from super successful people
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.040]   like Oprah or Richard Branson
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.760]   about how they've increased their productivity,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.940]   and more importantly, their fulfillment in life.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.060]   We wanna talk also about how you can create a playbook
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.260]   at work or home to codify how you do something
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.700]   and also to help someone else do it for you.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.540]   We'll also touch on why almost everyone should consider
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.880]   hiring some type of administrative assistant
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.100]   and how Dan uses a house manager
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100]   to take care of nearly every aspect of his family's life
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.120]   and ways that you can start to implement pieces of that
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.120]   in your own.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.460]   There'll probably be a lot more,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.640]   so let's get started right after this.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.340]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.660]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.820]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen,
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780]   but one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.220]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.060]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.700]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.800]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.100]   for this episode.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.140]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.400]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.740]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.760]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.380]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.320]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.500]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.660]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.320]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.500]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.800]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.140]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.460]   Dan, welcome to the show.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.360]   Thanks for being here.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.420]   - Chris, it's an honor.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.660]   I'm super excited.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.300]   This is the podcast I've been wanting to do for a long time
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.260]   just 'cause I know your audience is nerdy
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.740]   as much as I am on this topic.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.500]   - I want to start letting people know
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.940]   who's coming on to get questions
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.040]   'cause I'm sure people listening now would have great things.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.480]   So that's something I might kick off in 2023.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.420]   But I want to jump right in.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.720]   Saving time, freeing it up, buying it back
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.540]   with help from others is your superpower.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.760]   We've talked about this before, both in work and life.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.880]   I want to hear how you got so good at it
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.760]   because it's something that so many people struggle with
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.560]   and also why you think it's so important
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.660]   that people start doing it
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.160]   no matter where they are in their stage of life.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.740]   - I learned this the hard way.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.240]   I've been a business builder,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.900]   tried to be an entrepreneur growing up,
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.840]   failed for 7 years, just tried.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.940]   And when I was 24, I found a different gear.
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.120]   Sounds crazy, but I read my first business book.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.380]   Turned out to be a good move.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.820]   And then I actually hired a business coach,
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.660]   this guy named Bob.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.420]   He was an E-Myth certified coach.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.220]   And Bob taught me a lot about business.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.060]   And when I was 24, I started this company called Spheric.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.600]   But what happened for me is over a four-year period,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.760]   even though we grew a lot,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.600]   we became a multi-million dollar company
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.740]   within a couple of years and grew to about 40 employees
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.980]   and won a bunch of awards,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.040]   I just got really good at being productive.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.680]   I didn't understand how to think of time and energy
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.120]   and just how I was showing up as a brother and a son
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.880]   and a partner in life and as a friend.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.220]   And what happened was,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.320]   is I was working at the office on a Sunday morning
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.060]   and I was supposed to be back around 11 o'clock.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.420]   I was engaged to a woman at the time
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.000]   and we had just bought a house.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.800]   And before I knew it, it was two o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.640]   And I was like, ran home and walked into the house
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   and I found my fiance in tears.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.340]   And she just was beside herself.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.840]   And she just looks at me and decides that was that.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.420]   And she just goes, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.920]   And takes the ring off and drops it on the counter.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.180]   And she walked out.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.320]   And seven weeks before our wedding,
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.660]   my life just shattered.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.820]   'Cause I think anybody that's done anything
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.100]   from working hard at their job
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.600]   to taking risks in a business,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.060]   they don't do it really for themselves.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.000]   I was doing it for her.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.100]   I was doing it for our future,
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.800]   our lives that we were gonna build together.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.200]   And that was when I had to look in the mirror
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.640]   and ask myself,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.600]   there's gotta be a different way to approach time
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.420]   because there was a six month period, Chris,
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.880]   that I actually thought that because I'm so driven in life
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   and I was so horrible,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.220]   I would go to birthday parties and bring my laptop.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.320]   And that was normal.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.060]   And I would think to myself, "I'm the best friend ever
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.820]   'cause I'm so busy that I showed up
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.300]   and I'd sit in the living room on a laptop
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.800]   while everybody else was enjoying music and partying."
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.040]   And it was just crazy.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.440]   That was the moment where I started reading books
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.300]   around leadership and personal development,
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.900]   really diving into that component of it.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.980]   And I just realized that it's not just about
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.480]   being super productive,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.920]   even though I think I've gotten world-class at that.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.820]   I've read all the productivity books.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.260]   It's really about understanding how your energy flows
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.560]   throughout your calendar and your week and your month
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.100]   and your quarter and all these things
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.900]   so that you can show up to the work or the people
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.460]   in a completely different way.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.640]   And that's why I wrote this book.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.940]   It's just become such a foundational part of my life
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.300]   that if we fast forward to today,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.900]   I have two incredible kids.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.780]   I have dinner with them every night.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.180]   I do quarterly retreats with my wife.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.720]   We go to seminars, personal development programs together.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.680]   I think I did 12 weeks of vacation this year.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.320]   And I'm the CEO of two eight-figure companies
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.720]   where I wake up and push things forward.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.800]   And there was no way that I could have done that
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.660]   if I didn't go through that painful moment
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.360]   to force me to learn the lessons
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.300]   that I share with people today.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.440]   - What sucks that you went through it,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.140]   but I know that you're now in a good place
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.180]   and I'm fortunate that you've learned those lessons
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.340]   so you can share them with us.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.880]   Where do you think people start with this?
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.080]   When I just heard you describe all of the stuff
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.240]   that you're doing now,
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.040]   my head kind of doesn't know how to compute it.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.320]   I'm like, well, I just have this one small little thing
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.120]   that's a podcast, it's not the eight-figure company.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.280]   It's just one of them.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.120]   I don't have that much vacation.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   My wife and I don't go on these retreats.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   So it just seems impossible.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.620]   - It kind of is.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.660]   I forgot to mention, I also did three Ironmans this year.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.760]   So like, it's kind of nuts, but Chris, we don't start there.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.360]   That's not where I started.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.800]   I think that the big thing for people to understand
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.740]   is that their calendar is telling them a story
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.140]   of what's important to them.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.740]   And I tell this to people all the time.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.340]   It's like, if you show me your calendar,
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.520]   I will tell you what is important to you,
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.820]   not what you tell me is important to you.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.320]   I work with a lot of at-risk youth
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.080]   and I just even do the same process with them
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.160]   is we do a calendar audit.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.260]   We look at what I call a time and energy audit
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.860]   of where are you actually spending your time
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.800]   and allocating that and try to create a life
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.960]   that's by design, not by default.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.340]   That's like a first principle.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.940]   I can teach you all the ways to get more time,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.880]   but if you don't at least admit to yourself that,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.440]   hey, you have to be a little bit more proactive,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.020]   you gotta be a planner.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.180]   You need to look at your time and assess
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.280]   and have a period of reflection to ask yourself like,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.060]   was this a good use of my time?
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.160]   Did it deliver not only the success impact
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.860]   that I would like it to have my career or with my friends,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.640]   but did it also bring the joy?
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   One thing I do every year at the end
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.640]   is I look at my previous 12 month period
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.280]   and I look at all the things I said yes to and I did.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.000]   And then I go like, okay, what were the best experiences?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.120]   And then I go, okay, what's true about those ones?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.020]   And one example in my life is I don't go on vacation
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.520]   unless there's a physical component to what I'm doing.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.260]   I've had people like, hey, come to Europe
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.280]   and let's go drive super cars.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.260]   I'm like, eh, what else?
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.620]   Like, are we gonna go hike a mountain?
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.500]   Are we gonna do a three-day bike trip?
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.920]   I just like had this feedback loop.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.200]   And that's for me, for other people,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.100]   they're like, I have no interest in doing that,
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.000]   but riding around in super cars in Europe sounds fun.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.840]   Let me do that.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.100]   Like, I'm just saying,
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.400]   if we don't have a process of reflection,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.700]   then there's no way you can be proactive.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.940]   And that's where it starts.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.600]   It's with the calendar
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.280]   and it's not just a productivity thing,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.680]   it's an energy thing.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.920]   'Cause this is the cool part, Chris.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.260]   I learned that the energy that I bring to the work
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.360]   can have a three to four times increase in output.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.600]   What do I mean by this?
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.640]   Well, before I start doing a creative project,
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.280]   I'm full of like self-doubt and frustration and anxiety
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.340]   and like all these negative beliefs and I'm in low energy.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.340]   The thing I'm creating literally has an impact.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.520]   It's so funny because I see that where it's like, okay,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.860]   if you're organizing an event
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.720]   and like one of the tasks for you to do
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.760]   is to like go and recruit sponsors,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.260]   if you just got in a fight with your better half
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.720]   because you forgot to do something,
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.940]   like that energy shows up in the emails,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.240]   it shows up in your language, it shows up in your body.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.660]   And it's just so fascinating
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.780]   that people don't consider that.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.580]   So for me, I'm always looking at the work I do
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.740]   and I just use a green highlighter and a red highlighter.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.880]   It's like, this gives me energy and this takes my energy.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.340]   And as much as I can,
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.280]   I try to remove the things that take my energy
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   so that I'm stacking this like positive energy flow
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.360]   to the work because it literally will have a two, three,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.000]   four times amplifier to the outcome I'm after.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.100]   - I'm sure there are things,
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.220]   especially for anyone listening who has a job
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.700]   and they're not the boss that just take the energy out.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.540]   Are there certain places or times a day
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.800]   where you put those things?
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.500]   - Yeah, I think everybody's different.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.380]   I think Chris, maybe you can relate to this
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.580]   with the new family.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.440]   Before I had kids versus after I had kids.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.720]   I used to be somebody that was more of a night owl
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.180]   and then I would start my day later and that was okay.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.420]   Maybe I would like get to work
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.760]   and I would jump into meetings
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   and then do some more creative work in the afternoon.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.100]   And then what happened is once I had these human alarm
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.660]   clocks, my two sons, and they're 11 months apart,
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.260]   it was bananas, which was another forcing function
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.240]   to get really good at the stuff I talk about.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.340]   What I do now is I do all of my creative work
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.200]   in the morning and maybe if your boss tells you
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.840]   what to do with your time, but I know my team,
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.180]   we focus on outcomes.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.680]   We tell people like what they should do.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.480]   Sure, there's meetings they have to be at,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.320]   but they're responsible for their own calendar.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.780]   So if you can design it, the energy flows,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.420]   like what works good for me is all my creative work
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.820]   I do in the mornings.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.760]   I try to push out any in-person conversations till later on.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.940]   I personally like to work out at lunch
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.960]   because it creates a reset.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.940]   And then I bring that reset energy
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.900]   into the afternoon conversations.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.280]   And then I batch.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.140]   There's so much stuff we can talk about around like,
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.680]   just getting more out of the time we have.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.380]   So it's so funny 'cause like a lot of times
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.420]   I'm like managing my leaders and they're talking to me,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.620]   you know, I'm overwhelmed.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.120]   I don't have this and this.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.220]   And then we do a time and energy audit with their calendar.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.260]   And it's really just about negotiating
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.060]   like constraints in an interface.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.560]   Like a lot of people have the ability to call somebody up
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.800]   and say, "Hey, I know we have this meeting
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.560]   every Tuesday at nine.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.640]   Is there any way we can move it to 11 a.m.?"
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.600]   Because it's the only thing that's breaking up my morning.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.700]   And if I had an extra hour and a half
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.640]   and uninterrupted, not broken up time
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.240]   to work on like some creative projects,
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.180]   I really think I'd be more effective.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.380]   Most people would be like,
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.380]   "Yeah, it actually doesn't change my life.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.140]   And if that's gonna support you, game on."
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.280]   So I just think like trying to understand
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.060]   how you like to work.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.780]   And then the key is to honor the calendar.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.960]   It's like, I know what my week looks like.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.860]   And I review my calendar the night before
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.100]   and try to tweak anything that needs to be there.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.360]   And then when it shows up,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.600]   like I put my work in the calendar,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.840]   even if there's nobody else involved.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.540]   Like I literally, my to-do list is in my calendar
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   and I just honor what I put in there.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.800]   I think too often people drag their feet,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   spend a little too much time on TikTok or Instagram,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.780]   whatever.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.080]   And then that thing that they had an hour blocked out of,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.140]   it's really 35 minutes and they're rushing through it.
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.420]   So there's that.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.120]   But if you have the discipline and you're proactive,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.720]   then I think that energy management flow
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.520]   is actually more productive than just saying,
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.720]   "I'm managing my time and I'm being productive in my time."
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.760]   And that's what shifted for me after my fiance left me
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.320]   and I had to rebuild my life,
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.820]   was now I structure things so that
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.120]   when I transition in between meetings,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.460]   I can be 100% present.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.740]   Because before I was just dealing with like arguments
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.840]   and friction and what I call emotional shrapnel
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.040]   that often I was creating myself.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.180]   If you're not a planner,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.740]   one of my best friends, amazing human being,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.180]   but gosh darn it, this guy is so forgetful
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.540]   and not a planner.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.180]   The amount of times that I've seen him lose
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.680]   like two or three hours,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.420]   I seen him drive eight hours to go pick something up
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.720]   because he'd forgotten he needed it
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.100]   the next day for something.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.100]   And I just think to myself like,
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.760]   "Man, if he just spent a little bit more time
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.640]   "measuring twice, cutting once,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.400]   "he would get back like two months of his year.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   "He would pull forward two months of productivity
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.140]   "into his calendar year
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.780]   "for like a fraction of the time invested."
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.640]   So again, it's emotional shrapnel.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.880]   It's self-inflicted.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.040]   You're literally throwing hand grenades off in your life.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.980]   And then you're dealing with the fallout of it
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.120]   just because you just haven't built that skill set
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.760]   and that discipline of being a little bit more disciplined.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.020]   - So two things.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.720]   One, I encourage anytime I have a meeting
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.020]   that gets invited to me,
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.520]   especially if it's a recurring meeting at work,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.420]   I guess technically I'm not at a company anymore.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.900]   But when I was,
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.900]   if they didn't select the let guests modify events button
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.940]   in Google Calendar or I'm sure
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.280]   on whatever calendaring system,
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.540]   I immediately fall out.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.440]   I know this meeting is not for a couple of weeks
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.840]   or can you enable this feature?
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.680]   And I had it enabled by default.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.080]   So I'd encourage everyone to make calendaring easier
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.820]   to just ask everyone to enable that feature
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.020]   on any recurring meeting
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.820]   so that you have the ability to move it
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.120]   without having to say, "Hey, can we move it?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.460]   "Now we gotta go back and forth
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.260]   "spending on Slack or email."
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.100]   Just enable that.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.360]   So that's one.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.060]   Two, you talk a lot about discipline,
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.640]   but let's talk about what happens when I sit down
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.040]   and I've got 30 minutes blocked off
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.140]   to go plan the next episode I'm gonna do.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.340]   And there's a million other little tiny things
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.380]   on a to-do list that I could go try to knock off
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.820]   that seem easier to make progress on.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.200]   How does that discipline work for you?
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.820]   What makes that possible?
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.220]   - I think what's unique if you watch the way I work
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.900]   is I actually take all those projects
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.120]   or things that are in my calendar
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.680]   and I break down the tasks of the work I'm gonna do
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.560]   in the calendar description.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.140]   So everything that is creative output that I need to do,
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.700]   and I'm literally looking at like 17 projects I'm working on,
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.140]   they already have the mini tasks inside of it broken down
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.420]   because most people procrastinate
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.740]   'cause they don't have clarity
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.680]   as to what the next action item.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.940]   So if the thing says 60 minutes to go recruit sponsors
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.380]   for event or some play or whatever it is,
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.860]   and in it, it's like, "Send five emails."
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.780]   Like you're literally that descriptive.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.520]   You're like, "Send five emails to this person.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.060]   "Call John, ask him about this."
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.040]   I write it all down and kind of go,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.300]   I would say 120% of what would need to happen
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.700]   for the goal to achieve.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.680]   So I always try to give myself a little bit more tasks to do.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.820]   That way, if I don't get to it or if I do get to it,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.500]   it's just it increases the probability
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.020]   of the thing happening.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.920]   'Cause I coach so many CEOs, we do these calendar audits,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.420]   and I'm like, "Why didn't you do that?"
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.380]   And they're like, "The truth was I didn't actually know
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.860]   "what I needed to do."
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.460]   And it's like, "Cool, here's what we're gonna change."
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.580]   Not when you gotta do the work, but as you plan your week.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.580]   So for me, I do them on Sunday nights.
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.500]   And I know a lot of people are like,
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.740]   "Look, you're asking me to work Sunday."
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.300]   It's like, "You can do it Monday morning if you want."
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.380]   But Sunday night, I look at my projects
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.140]   and I grab the big rocks and I put them in,
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.620]   for me, my mornings,
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.260]   and I put them into typically 90-minute blocks.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.340]   Like that's about as long as I wanna work on one project
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.500]   for until I kind of get bored with it.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.940]   And I outline in that 90-minute blocks
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.540]   all the stuff I'm gonna do.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.540]   And I just keep a note file and I just copy and paste it.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.140]   And I work through that list.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.540]   So like Monday, I might attack it.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.380]   Tuesday, I'll attack it.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.220]   Wednesday, I'll attack it.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.100]   And I'm just working through that list.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.100]   I'll literally, as I get done that 90-minute block,
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.300]   I'll just edit it for the next day 'cause it's shorter,
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.140]   'cause I got a bunch of stuff done.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.000]   And then that way, when I sit down,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.720]   there's no procrastination because like you said, Chris,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.620]   it's like, "I know I have this other to-do list
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.660]   "that I can go get some wins on."
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.740]   But technically, your big project is a to-do list.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.900]   And if you just break it down,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.860]   and you just attack that one and you can get some wins
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.740]   so you can build momentum.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.820]   'Cause I always got frustrated in software development land
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.060]   that I grew up in.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.280]   Dude, it would take like months to write code
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.860]   to get a product built.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.460]   Whereas this other guy who works in construction,
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.740]   he literally sees every day when he's done
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.540]   the progress he made.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.940]   And it feels so good.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.920]   I know that when I was helping my dad growing up,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.780]   build a deck or redo a roof or whatever,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.500]   felt so good to make these small wins.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.060]   That's how I've set up my life
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.080]   is I just wanna take the bigger outcome,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.280]   break it down into projects,
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.460]   break those down into tasks, put it in my calendar.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.220]   And then I just follow and I honor it.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.740]   And look, if I get the wrong list
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.100]   and I get some feedback, it's like,
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.900]   "Oh, I thought I would do this and that didn't work.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.500]   "Next time I just change it."
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.140]   But it just allows you to build momentum with your day.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.980]   And I think that's what a lot of people are missing out of.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.180]   It's that lack of clarity.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.020]   People procrastinate 'cause they don't have clear,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.740]   like, "Boom, this is what I gotta go do.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.720]   "One, it's 15 minutes.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.560]   "Let's go get it done.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.500]   "Let's go get a small win.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.580]   "Let's build some momentum."
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.740]   And then that momentum becomes almost addictive.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.780]   Like I just get excited about
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.860]   how much can I get done in a period of time
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.860]   and how can I look for leverage.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.340]   - Leverage is gonna be a bulk of this discussion.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.140]   But before, I wanna know,
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.780]   do you keep a separate to-do list
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.020]   or is the calendar the to-do list?
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.140]   - I keep a to-do list.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.700]   I kind of have like a high level Google Doc, okay?
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.620]   It's called to-dos.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.220]   And what's unique about it,
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.120]   and this is how I'm able to unplug at the end of the day.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.060]   Now I'm blessed to have an executive assistant
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.020]   that manages 99% of my inbox.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.580]   But things that do end up in my world,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.700]   what I do at the end of the day is I take anything...
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.940]   That's why I like the world we live in
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.300]   where it's all linkable.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.700]   Anything that I need to process the next day,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.380]   I put it in the to-do list and I link to the email.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.820]   So it's literally, it'll say like reply to Chris
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.660]   or whatever it is.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.020]   And I link to the email on my Gmail.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.660]   And then I put it in the Google Doc.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.860]   And then I grab, let's say the five or six that are there
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.240]   and I put it in my calendar the next morning
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.560]   for a 60-minute block.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.520]   And it'll just say like process to-dos.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.360]   And that way, again,
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.000]   like this is how I want it defined and easy.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.080]   So I open the calendar and I just open up all my tabs.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.880]   I just like open up just those emails.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.280]   See, that's where a lot of people get stuck.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.920]   They open up their inbox and then it's like,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.340]   burp, burp, burp, all these things they got to do.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.320]   I just open up the tabs to the thing.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.200]   It could be like review a copy for a blog post.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.960]   It's like a link just to the thing.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.400]   And when I'm done, I close the tab.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.460]   So I create almost like momentum I'm building
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.820]   'cause I like start on the left side
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.240]   and I work through them.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.660]   They're prioritized.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.280]   And it's either emails or projects or creative stuff
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.880]   or like some mirror document I got to prove or look at.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.060]   And then because I put it in that Google Doc
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.280]   at the end of my day,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.440]   like at the very end of my day,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.600]   that's the last thing I do is I look at my inbox,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.620]   I look at my projects list,
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.300]   I move them into the to-do,
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.660]   copy paste and put in my calendar.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.560]   Dude, I sleep like a champ.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.880]   Like I don't wanna brag, but I use Oura Ring.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.680]   I'm literally gonna pull up my Oura score right now.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.600]   'Cause people see me wake up so early
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.000]   and they're like, "When do you sleep?"
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.440]   I got an 88 yesterday, which is a pretty beefy score.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.620]   I don't toss and turn.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.800]   My brain doesn't worry about forgetting stuff
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.400]   because I've locked and loaded it
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.240]   into my life and my calendar.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.980]   So that's like the to-do list of Google Doc.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.640]   And what's unique is at the top of it,
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.420]   I have all my 25-year vision stuff
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.000]   and five years and one year.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.160]   I'm a little crazy like that.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.240]   I don't worry about the how,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.440]   but I do know what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.180]   Like I wrote down that I wrote this book six years ago.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.080]   I wrote down best-selling book, business category,
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.040]   and I stared at it for this long
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   until two and a half years ago,
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.120]   we started working on the project.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.520]   But that way I'm looking at like the big vision stuff
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.360]   25 years from now, 10 years, five years, one year.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.180]   And then my to-do and my calendar has to map.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.760]   I've gotta be able to see what I'm doing this week
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.680]   and how it drives to those outcomes.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.880]   Specifically, like you label them to it
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   or just because it's at the top of the doc,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.560]   it's a constant reminder?
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.240]   Because it's at the top and I scan it every morning
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.420]   as part of my process.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.440]   So before I work on any of the to-dos,
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.020]   I just read through them.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.180]   It's almost like it ramps up into my mind.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.420]   It's like, "Oh yeah, don't forget.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.520]   This is why we're doing it."
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.740]   I have very unique approaches that work for me.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.860]   I call it RPM.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.500]   I always focus on results, then purpose, then the activity.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.380]   So a lot of people focus on the how,
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.700]   I focus on the what and the why first.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.940]   Because I've learned a long time ago,
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.780]   the purpose of why I'm doing something
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.960]   actually matters more than the actual outcome
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.420]   that I'm trying to achieve.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.160]   There one in your list that you could walk through those?
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.040]   I can walk you through everything.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   I'm an open book.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.880]   Let me go...
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.040]   I have it open right now.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.240]   So my vision for my life is help a million at-risk youth.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.440]   So mentor them.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.520]   So that's a big one.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.640]   Build the 3 billion multi-generational wealth.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.320]   These are big things, but that's where I'm at.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.920]   And so I can go through those,
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.880]   build 30 million company,
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.560]   which we're well on our way by 2025.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.600]   So that's the vision stuff.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   And then RPM is my different things.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.200]   So I have my high-speed ventures, $100 million fund.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.160]   I've got my book.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.400]   It literally says right there,
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.760]   buy back books at New York Times bestseller,
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.420]   back end, specific outcomes of those things,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.900]   my coaching company.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.360]   Then it breaks down into quarterly projects
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.960]   that I've committed to to achieve these things.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.680]   So like big vision this year, quarterly projects.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.640]   And then I have my to-do list.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.880]   Oh, and I also have a waiting on.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.080]   This is another little secret tip that I like,
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.440]   which is I don't worry if people got back to me
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.880]   because if I send something to you
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.160]   and it's really important,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.840]   I only put stuff in my waiting on list
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.920]   if it's like things that are gonna affect my goals.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.520]   But let's say I email you,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.640]   I'll literally grab that sent email
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.720]   and put it in my waiting on list.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.840]   And I'll do the same thing where I'll open up
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.880]   all the waiting on, maybe five or six people,
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.660]   and then follow up.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.360]   So some people use software for that,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.080]   like follow up, whatever tools,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.440]   but I just do it that way.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.680]   And that way I can visually see it.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.840]   But it's very simple.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.120]   It's a Google Doc.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.960]   - For me, it's just superhuman remind me.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.920]   If it's a thing I don't care about, I'll archive it.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.000]   And if it's a thing that I'm like,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.920]   no, this is really important,
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.760]   I want them like in two weeks, remind me,
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.680]   in one week, remind me.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.720]   I haven't found a good way to merge
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.080]   the to-do list in the email.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.880]   'Cause like 50% of my to-do list is email
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.520]   or it lives in my inbox, maybe is a better way to frame it.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.880]   - That's why I take it out.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.480]   I don't want it in the inbox.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.860]   I think there's tools like Motion is a new one
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.520]   that I've seen Facebook ads about like taking your to-dos
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.760]   and put them in your calendar.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.880]   But I just either manually do it
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.640]   or I have my assistant do it
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.200]   because we talk often about like,
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.800]   here are my top projects.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.040]   And I use color coding in my calendar to know
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.320]   if I'm allocating the right amount of time
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   for different projects.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.880]   So that's another little hack I use.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.200]   So if it's like this is like one, two, and three
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.720]   are the most important to me,
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.800]   I can visually look at the color coding we're using
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.000]   in my week to know if I'm allocating
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.400]   the right amount of time to move certain projects forward.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.560]   Like my book is orange right now.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.760]   And in the calendar is pretty orange
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.040]   because it is a top priority for me.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.860]   - Well, I'm excited.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.720]   I got a chance to read it.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.520]   I wanna jump into the theme
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.800]   because it's one thing to be productive.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.120]   I've talked about it a little bit.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.360]   I love hearing the way you think about your time management,
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.720]   but time's a limited resource.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.600]   And one of the only ways to get it back
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.200]   is to try to find ways to outsource what you're doing
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.160]   so that you have more time to do what you want.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.600]   So let's talk about it.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.000]   I know one of the things that I wanna start with
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   is around mindset.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.440]   You bring up mindset a lot,
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.640]   especially when it comes to buying back your time.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.720]   So maybe let's just talk about a few of the objections
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.640]   I think some people hear or think of
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.040]   when they think about this concept,
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.560]   which is like, well, I don't have the time
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.940]   to go find someone to help me with all these things.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.020]   I don't have the money to spend on this
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.760]   and no one can really do it like I can.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.680]   So are there other big ones
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.200]   or how do you think about all the objections people have
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.640]   before we jump into the tactics?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.640]   So those are the top three
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.960]   and we can kind of overcome those beliefs.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.840]   The other one that comes up often that is unexpressed
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.920]   but is underneath the surface is I don't feel worthy.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.140]   And that one I coach not a lot,
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.320]   but I've coached especially women CEOs
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.840]   and they seem to struggle with it a bit more.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.580]   And the language that I hear is I just feel guilty
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.460]   that I can't run my company and take care of my household
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.280]   or like I'm worried what my mom is gonna say
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.000]   or my mother-in-law or like my neighbor.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.080]   It's really fascinating to hear that.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.420]   But the truth is everybody's got their own
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.080]   limiting beliefs about the world
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.240]   that's gonna stop them from achieving more.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.520]   It doesn't matter if it's like getting more time back
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.560]   or being successful in your career.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.800]   You have to understand that your beliefs
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.900]   about how the world works and how we respond
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.100]   is what's stopping us.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.660]   The one of like, I don't have time.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.060]   Well, you decide what you do with your time.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.960]   Change the language to I choose not to make time for this.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.700]   As soon as you change the language from I don't have time
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.600]   to I choose not to make time,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.780]   that's an honest conversation that you can then address.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.380]   But most people will blame an external factor and say,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.460]   oh, I just don't have time for that.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.820]   It's like, no, you do.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.620]   If we looked at your calendar and I asked you,
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.080]   tell me what you did yesterday,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.720]   there'll be things that you chose to do
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.040]   instead of working on this problem.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.540]   So let's talk about why you're choosing not to do it.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.060]   So that's the first thing.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.740]   - And by the way, you can apply that
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.260]   to so many different aspects.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.260]   I was talking to someone the other day,
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.980]   I was like, I would love to lose 10 pounds.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.260]   I was like, would you really?
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.660]   'Cause like losing 10 pounds is not some mythical thing
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.020]   that is really hard to figure out.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.140]   Like a combination of diet and exercise.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.220]   - It's called caloric deficit over time.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.940]   - Yeah, yeah, so like you can do it.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.700]   So don't say that you would love to do it
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.460]   because say, I wish I had the time to do it.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.300]   Well, not even that.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.420]   How about I don't wanna prioritize it right now.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.660]   It's not important.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.140]   'Cause if it was important, you could just do it.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.700]   I still catch myself up in this.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.980]   It's hard to get over it.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.460]   Like I feel like just as humans we're trained this way,
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.100]   but yeah, you do have time.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.540]   Just how do you wanna prioritize your time?
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.820]   What's important to you right now?
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.620]   And if it's not, that's okay.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.940]   But just be honest with yourself.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:38.780]   - It's on that line.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.460]   I was coaching a client, Carrie,
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.940]   and she was complaining about like,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.340]   I don't have time to go to the gym.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.980]   It's like she knew what she needed to do.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.380]   And then it's like, then we talked about,
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.300]   it's like you said, it's like,
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.020]   you're choosing not to do it.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.540]   You know the benefit of it.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.780]   There's some friction there.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.100]   There's a blockers we need to work through.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.020]   And once we work through it, then it was like, okay.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.220]   And it's this language of even I get to versus I have to.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.180]   I really think that like a rich life,
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.060]   it's not about money,
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.220]   but let's just call it like a rich life versus a poor life.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.340]   A rich life is somebody that wakes up saying,
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.380]   I get to do this.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.700]   Whereas a poor life is somebody wakes up and says,
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.700]   I have to do this.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.980]   And it's such a subtle thing,
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.020]   but it will literally transform your life.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.620]   If you say like, I get to work out, I get to go to work,
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.940]   I get to drop my kids off at whatever,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.180]   I get to work on this project.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.620]   These are things that you think are like tough or hard,
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.460]   or I don't want to do it, but it's like,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.980]   yeah, let's reframe the stuff.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.340]   So on the belief, I can't afford it's another one.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.220]   Here's the way I think about it is,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.460]   every person has the ability to create value with their time.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.660]   It's why we have jobs.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.980]   When we start off in life, we trade time for money.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.620]   Some people create more value in that amount of time,
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.620]   so they get compensated by the market.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.260]   And Jim Rohn, he's one of the OG personal development guys
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.780]   back in the day, used to talk about this.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.020]   He goes, a lot of people don't realize is that
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.900]   the market is a value rewarding system.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   Whether we like it or not, we live in a capitalist society.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.220]   And to the degree that you create value,
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.660]   you will be rewarded for that.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.740]   And it doesn't matter if you're a business owner
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.620]   or a team member or CEO,
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.580]   because he even says like the highest paid CEO in the world
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.100]   makes $100 million a year.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.500]   And that's Tim Cook at Apple.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.740]   Well, the reason why the board pays him that
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.380]   and he gets that and nobody blinks at it
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.580]   is because he created a trillion dollars worth of value.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.420]   So my question to people when they say,
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.900]   well, I can't afford it.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.940]   I want to ask them, well,
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.820]   how can you become more valuable?
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.460]   Because if we can talk about how you become more valuable
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.340]   to your employer, to your team, to your community,
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.660]   then you start to ask yourself,
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.540]   well, now that I know what I can do to become more valuable,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.380]   I need to find the time to do it.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.260]   And that's where the time trading comes into play.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.300]   Well, that's what the best people in the world add
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.220]   is they're just good traders of time.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.540]   So you start off as time for money,
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.940]   and you'll do that for a while
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.940]   until hopefully you're getting paid a lot more
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.580]   because you're becoming more valuable.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.980]   But then at some point,
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.740]   it doesn't matter if you're a business owner or not,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.740]   you got to get good at trading money for time.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.940]   That's level two.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.900]   Okay, and I talk about this in the book.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.020]   Level three is where I want everybody to eventually get
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.980]   is where you start trading money for money.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.460]   This is the investing side.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.540]   These are skill sets.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.380]   These are beliefs.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.220]   These are strategies.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.700]   You have to develop them.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.580]   But that is the path of life.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.660]   And nobody shared this with me my whole life
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.740]   until one day I realized it's like,
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.260]   oh yeah, we start off everybody.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.460]   We start off trading time for money.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.020]   And then if we get smart and more valuable,
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.100]   then we trade money for time.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.340]   And then if that works out really well
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.180]   and we get good at that,
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.380]   then we have an excess or overcapacity of capital
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.780]   to then invest to have our money work for us.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.740]   And that's freedom.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.020]   And that's what people are after.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.580]   They're like, "Hey, I want to show up every day
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.100]   and I want to create an outcome
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.060]   so that one day I don't have to work.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.780]   I can decide if I want to work."
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.060]   The "I get to" is not a mindset thing.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.820]   It's actually like a reality.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.340]   And that's where I think life gets really interesting
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.300]   when you wake up and you get to decide
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.580]   what you want to create on.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.260]   But it starts by just becoming more valuable
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.020]   so that you have the resources
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.820]   to be able to buy back more time
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.460]   to then become more valuable again to the market.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.700]   And then there's the,
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.740]   "Nobody can do it better than me, Chris."
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.700]   My role is 80% done by somebody else
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.860]   is 100% freaking awesome.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.860]   And I just think we got to reduce our expectations.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   My wife, we were talking about this yesterday
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.340]   'cause she's like, "You're so good
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.700]   at not worrying if the person gets it right the first time."
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.500]   And I go, "Well, I can tell you where that comes from."
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.420]   Thousands of hours of being let down
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.100]   and realizing that if I expect every person
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.500]   that I bring into my life to know everything I know
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.420]   and do everything the way I think I'm gonna do,
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.500]   I'm just gonna live a life of being disappointed.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.380]   And instead, the way I look is I reframe it
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.940]   and I just say, "80% done by somebody else
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.540]   is 100% freaking awesome."
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.460]   If I have somebody else go to the grocery store for me
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.940]   and bring me my food to my house
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.620]   and yes, every once in a while,
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.500]   they got the wrong bananas or whatever,
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.860]   I didn't have to do it.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.820]   And I'm really grateful that I got to take that time
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.460]   to go work on something creative
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.540]   or spend time with people I love or whatever.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.860]   And it just changes the expectation.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.500]   That's where when we start working on these beliefs,
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.900]   then it frees us up to actually invite other people
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.900]   to support us and use these tools to get more productive,
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.300]   to get more done.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.300]   But if you hold onto these beliefs,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.060]   then you'll always hit a ceiling
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.260]   and you'll never actually free up your time.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.940]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.420]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.020]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.460]   in your situation,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.060]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.340]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.180]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.340]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.420]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.860]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.260]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.220]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.540]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.700]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.020]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.740]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.540]   are first generation wealth,
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.620]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.780]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.100]   and learn from each other
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.700]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.980]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.340]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.740]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.900]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.900]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.380]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.820]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.140]   to your children's education,
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.460]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.900]   So many of these conversations
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.140]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.820]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.660]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.820]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.900]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.020]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.540]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.500]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.580]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.780]   This podcast started as a side project I did
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.500]   because I wanted to share my passion
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.260]   for upgrading my own life.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.860]   I didn't intend to start a business,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.940]   but here we are,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.060]   and maybe you're like me and have an idea,
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.780]   but you don't know where to start.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.360]   Well, I love how Shopify makes it easy
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.300]   for anyone to successfully run their own business,
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.060]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.100]   Whether you're selling Japanese tea or custom travel guides,

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.400]   And they even let you sell across social media marketplaces
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.180]   like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.980]   What's incredible to me about Shopify
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.300]   is that no matter how big you wanna grow,
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.100]   Shopify is there to empower you
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.520]   with the confidence and control

[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.300]   Now it's your turn to get serious about selling
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.240]   and try Shopify today.

[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.220]   I wanna go briefly back to the money one
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.860]   because I know that it's the one
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.060]   that I struggled with the most,
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.940]   and I'm guessing maybe there's some people out here
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.540]   that are feeling the same way,
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.260]   which is it's not that you necessarily don't have the money,
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.660]   it's that it just feels irresponsible maybe,
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.060]   or if I were to watch a movie and then I'm like,
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.380]   well, I should pay someone to go do this thing,
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.180]   but like I had the time, I just watched this movie.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.420]   So how do you help people value their time?
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.860]   I always have them start simple.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.420]   And the truth is that they need to understand
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.340]   what their time's worth.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.340]   And the math equation is pretty straightforward.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:56.020]   It's whatever you get paid annually to do a job, right?
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.020]   So you make, let's say 100,000 a year, it's simple math.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.740]   And then you divide it by 2000, right?
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.280]   That's the amount of value of your hour.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.660]   That works out to about $50.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.600]   My rule, and I call it the buyback rate,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.140]   is if you can pay somebody else to do whatever you're doing
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.860]   for a quarter, like one fourth of that amount,
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.560]   $12.50 in that circumstance,
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.980]   then you should.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.700]   When you start using that filter in your personal life,
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.340]   from laundry service to house cleaning,
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.420]   to Uber Eats, to a lot of stuff,
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.180]   you can start buying back that time.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.300]   Now, I also don't think you should buy back your time
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.440]   to hang out on a beach or watch Netflix.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.700]   I think you should ask yourself, again, it's that time trade.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.820]   It's how do we become more valuable to the market?
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.700]   And I also agree you should relax
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.980]   and enjoy yourself and recharge.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.880]   So I'm not saying you become a workaholic,
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.660]   but if you constrain yourself to say,
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.080]   "Look, I'm only going to invest 40 hours a week
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.020]   in my career."
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.420]   So you hard block it and you create this constraint.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.260]   Then you go, "Okay, well, right now,
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.540]   if I do a time and energy audit on my calendar,
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.420]   I'm spending time on things that are taking my energy
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.820]   and very low cost to pay somebody else to do."
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.900]   And then you attack that list of those items
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.220]   and you just start trying to bring support.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.340]   And then the key is go do things that make you more money.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.100]   And it only fits into one of two things.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.780]   You're either doing more of the thing
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   you're going to get paid more to do right now.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.780]   So it's a lot easier, obviously,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.500]   if you're in a role like sales
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.820]   or there's some performance component of the thing you do,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.780]   but you can negotiate that with your employer.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.140]   Like I have half my team
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.380]   on some level of performance compensation.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.820]   So they have a clear target that if they hit,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.540]   they get financially rewarded for it
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.060]   'cause that means everybody wins.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.220]   And then do more of that,
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.540]   like learn what that is or negotiate it with your employer
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.300]   and then free up your time.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.380]   And I'll give you a real example.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.820]   This guy, Wendell, who worked for me in sales,
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.620]   he was making a quarter million a year,
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.620]   which is a lot and I get it.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.620]   But what he decided to do on his own time,
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.740]   because he started to see like,
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.820]   "Hey, I'm on calls 30 hours a week on calls
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.420]   and then follow up and all this stuff."
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.060]   He was listening to me coach my clients
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.020]   'cause like a lot of stuff we do is public
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.540]   inside of our company, not what our client shares,
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.220]   but me, I record everything I do
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.460]   and just give it away to the team and put on social media.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.500]   And he hired his own assistant
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.740]   to literally do all of his follow-up,
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.580]   do his prospecting, manage his calendar,
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.980]   manage his inbox so that he could just do more calls
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.820]   'cause that's how he made more money.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.420]   So all of a sudden he doubles his output.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.380]   Then he has a surplus and he calls me out one day,
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.780]   he's like, "I don't know what to do all this money."
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.060]   I'm like, "Well, congratulations.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.620]   This is a very good problem to have.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.340]   Like, well done, sir."
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.300]   And I tell him to go into real estate.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.500]   He's like, "Well, how do I do that?"
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.940]   I go, "That's you to figure out."
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.940]   Like, this is the thing is you free up your time
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.740]   to then fill it with learning new skills that are valuable.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.020]   So he went into real estate, he hired a mentor,
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.220]   this is what I teach people,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.780]   like go find somebody that's done it before,
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.700]   bring that person in your life.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   And now what's crazy is he only does sales Monday,
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.260]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.020]   because on Friday his assistant is queuing up
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.860]   all of the showings for him to go look
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.780]   at new real estate deals.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.300]   He's already bought, I think he's on his fifth building.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.540]   He owns like 20 some doors or whatever it's called.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.020]   And like, he's doing really well
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.140]   because he's thought through this math.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.740]   And I know a lot of people are like,
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.060]   "Well, that's easy, he's making a quarter million
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.900]   a year."
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.540]   It doesn't matter if you're making 50,000 a year or 100,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.700]   you got to learn how to free up your time
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.900]   to then invest it in things that your employer
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.420]   is going to value, or at least the market's going to value.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.500]   And then if you want to go chill out and watch Netflix,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.020]   that's fine. It's just, if you're during the day
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.820]   and during the day you could do something
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.460]   to progress your career,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.980]   or you take an hour to drive to go get your food,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.220]   and instead you could just have the food delivered to you,
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.020]   so you could not have to take an hour to go do that.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.140]   That sounds like a great trade.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.820]   You just need to know ahead of time,
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.420]   when I'm buying back that time, I'm going to invest it.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.980]   I'm going to fill it with things that will compound
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.860]   and create more value in the future.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.900]   So there has to be trust.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.380]   You have to have sat down and thought about this
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.060]   and have a plan, and you just keep working through it.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.420]   So I just tell people to allocate a budget, right, Chris?
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.180]   It could be very simple, $500 a month.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.460]   Just take $500 and do the time and energy audit
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.820]   on your calendar and say,
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.820]   I'm just going to give myself permission to buy back,
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.660]   maybe less, let's call it $100 a month.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.220]   I don't know what it is.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.100]   And then if I buy back that time,
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.020]   I'm going to do this with that time
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.060]   that I think over a period of time will be more valuable.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.780]   It could be going to the gym,
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.700]   'cause I know for me, man,
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.620]   I show up way different if I worked out today
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.660]   than if I don't.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.500]   And that has a huge positive impact
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.780]   on the outcomes that I get to achieve.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.500]   So that's just the way I think about it.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.020]   - So let's talk about some of those things
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.460]   that you think people can get started buying back.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.020]   You gave some examples that I think are well-known,
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.820]   like ordering your groceries online
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.380]   or getting food delivered.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.140]   Great uses of trading dollars for time, I think, personally.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.420]   I do have some frustration with the grocery delivery
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.300]   because I felt like early on,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.860]   there were so many misses and poor replacements
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.260]   that if you were like me
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.060]   and you were trying to plan a dinner out,
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.300]   you'd get the wrong thing.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.780]   Now, I find that Amazon's inventory management
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.180]   for Amazon Fresh, at least, in the States,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.100]   is so good that I don't have that fear anymore.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.220]   So that's a few.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.540]   What are some of your favorites?
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.380]   - There's so many.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.260]   When I look at the early days of starting to do this,
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.980]   laundry service, I was crazy busy.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.740]   My fiance's pissed off at me.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.740]   I'm trying to get all my work done.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.380]   And this is what happened is I literally had to get
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.020]   a laundry service so that I could work on Sundays
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:44.860]   in the morning.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.100]   Normally, I was done by 11 a.m.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.740]   That was my rule and I got in trouble that day.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.580]   But obviously, just having somebody else
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.860]   take care of your laundry, like wash and fold,
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.700]   game changer.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.940]   Just low-hanging fruit.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.060]   Having somebody come in maybe once every two weeks,
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.740]   maybe once a week, to come in to clean your house,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.860]   to take care of the deep cleaning, that kind of stuff,
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.300]   that's a huge opportunity.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.780]   Some people are like, "I'm not gonna pay somebody else
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.740]   "25 bucks an hour to do something I can do myself."
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.020]   All right, well, how about we just get better
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.100]   at getting our time back?
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.340]   How about you start using a calendar?
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.220]   Like, that would be a big idea for people.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.460]   If we fail to plan, we plan to fail.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.060]   I don't know who said it, but like,
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.980]   I remember my wife's friend, she said that
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.100]   because she was just so frustrated with herself
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.380]   about the amount of wasted time running around your kids,
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.020]   and I forgot this happened and that.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.580]   And it's like, people don't realize how much time
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.500]   is wasted in just the commute.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.700]   So even just asking yourself like,
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.140]   "Are you driving to Costco?"
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:40.980]   Yes.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.700]   "Why don't you just order online?"
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.220]   "Well, I like to go to Costco."
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.420]   I know you like to go to Costco,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.020]   but if you tell me you like to go there
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.660]   and you don't have enough time to go to the gym,
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.060]   then you're making a decision to go to Costco
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.980]   because you like it versus go to the gym,
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.380]   which you know will have a compounding effect,
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.220]   especially with the health.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.860]   When you're healthy, you have like 1,000 goals and dreams.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.380]   And when you're not, you have one.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.540]   And I bring that one up because if that's not front
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.460]   and center for a lot of people,
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.740]   it should be the driving force behind everything
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.300]   we're talking about today,
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.420]   'cause it will have the biggest impact on your life,
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.180]   your mental health, your physical health,
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.180]   worry your family will have for you.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.340]   If you don't want your family to worry,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.180]   that's all parents want.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.540]   They wanna know you're happy and healthy.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.380]   That's a big one.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.460]   Other things is, again, when it comes to scheduling,
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.580]   it's everything from like cutting down on meetings,
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.340]   saying no, inviting people to you.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.340]   That's a big one.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.580]   So for example, I don't do the got a second meetings,
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.020]   coffee meetings, et cetera.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.420]   Chris, and I'm sure you don't either,
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.700]   'cause like I can buy myself coffee.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.620]   What I do instead is every Tuesday morning,
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.380]   I hike this mountain near my house.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.500]   And it's an open invite for anybody
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   that wants to pick my brain or hang out with me
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.500]   to come and do the hike with me.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.300]   And I've been doing it now since I moved to this new city,
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.540]   we live in Kelowna, BC for two years.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.860]   So every Tuesday morning, 6.30 AM,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.420]   if you wanna come hang out with me, anybody,
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.980]   and this is an open invite for your audience.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.820]   If they wanna fly to Kelowna and pick my brain,
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.980]   I will be there.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.060]   I call it net time, no extra time.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.780]   I compress all these other meetings into one experience.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.700]   And usually like it's a half hour hike up and then 15 down.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.940]   It allows me to have like great conversations.
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.180]   It allows me to get my workout in.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.060]   So like that's a big time saving one.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.060]   Even considering using like carpooling or public transit,
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.580]   and I'll tell you why,
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.100]   is a lot of people can do stuff if they're not driving.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.260]   A lot of people don't understand
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.740]   that taking the public transit, the train,
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.180]   I know in San Francisco, I used to use a car service.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.820]   Uber, actually funny enough,
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.100]   so Travis who started Uber was an investor
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.260]   in my company, Flowtown.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.700]   And when it came out,
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.420]   I was like using it for next level stuff.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.780]   I remember Travis saying to me, he's like,
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.380]   "You're the only person."
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.500]   I would send Ubers to go pick up my girlfriend at the time
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.340]   to bring her to the date, to save me time.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:57.500]   I would use it as almost like a delivery system of people
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.260]   to bring them to me to save me time.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:00.220]   Now that's an advanced thing.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.140]   People aren't gonna be doing this,
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.500]   but that's one for sure.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.980]   And then there's just a bunch of apps.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.260]   When you say that,
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.780]   now they've built in the delivery function.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.380]   But I remember one time, little things like,
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.900]   I recorded an interview in person
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.540]   and the SD card didn't work.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.020]   And there's a data recovery company in San Francisco.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.980]   And I was like, "Well, I'll just send the SD card
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.260]   "to the company on an Uber instead of drive to the city
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.260]   "and drive back."
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.340]   Using that for delivery.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.380]   You used to have to convince the driver to do it.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.660]   - You had to talk to him.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.100]   Yeah, now it's just part of the service.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.220]   - You're like, "Oh, I left my laptop at this meeting."
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.140]   And you're like, "Hey, do you think you could pick this lab?
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.380]   "I'll have someone bring it out."
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.660]   So yeah, I love that one.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.820]   My whole rule, if you had to put it into a list,
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.060]   it's go mobile.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:41.380]   I do not use services that don't have a mobile experience.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.740]   And this is for everything, home automation,
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.820]   security systems, lighting systems,
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.180]   anything that my wife wants to buy
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.140]   that's like an electronic,
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.580]   I ask if they have a mobile app
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.140]   because I want to be integrated into my workflow
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.020]   and just be able to access it wherever I'm at.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.860]   That's a big one.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.580]   The other one is automation.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.940]   Anywhere that I'm doing the same thing over and over,
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.220]   I look for tools for automation.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.460]   We do that for lawn care.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.780]   We do it for locks, lights,
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.740]   cleaning cycles for things, and just services.
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.820]   You know, like having somebody come to your house
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.260]   to clean your car.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.580]   That's a real thing.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.460]   Or like my buddy, Brad,
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.220]   his wife was spending every Wednesday afternoon
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.820]   cleaning their cars.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.220]   And I was like, "Hey dude, you guys have a cleaning lady."
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.060]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.020]   I go, "Why don't you just ask the cleaning lady
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:30.900]   "to clean the cars?"
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.740]   "Oh, geez.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.660]   "I don't know if we could do that."
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.180]   "Yeah, the woman who's cleaning your house
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.900]   "obviously knows how to clean.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.700]   "She drives a car.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.040]   "Pretty sure she cleans her own car.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.220]   "She probably wants more hours."
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.960]   It's so funny when we just start thinking of things
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.980]   through that lens of like, how do we put things together?
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.180]   And then the no touch side is the third principle.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.780]   The no touch is kind of what we talked about,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.020]   like using online, like Costco.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.260]   I don't go to grocery stores.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.260]   I don't buy stuff.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.900]   My whole rule is to the degree that I am not touching stuff,
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.060]   that's how I want the world to work.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.940]   My brother, there was a point in his career,
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.700]   he's in the construction industry.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.900]   He's a home builder and whatnot.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.940]   He would probably spend two days a week,
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.860]   like 16 hours in his calendar,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.420]   just bringing stuff around to people.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.220]   Okay, and this is not complicated stuff.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.980]   It's just driving.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.420]   And eventually I said, "You should hire a runner."
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.900]   So some people can't afford to do that.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.700]   I just want them to think about that.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.820]   It's a little work, Chris.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.180]   I could get somebody to do wash and fold,
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.020]   but I got to bring it to there.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.880]   Okay, but that's that company.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.540]   There's actually another company
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.240]   that will come to your house and pick it up
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.540]   and do wash and fold.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.580]   Oh, I didn't even know that.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.100]   Yeah, and it's an extra $6.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.060]   So is the $6 worth you saving 40 minutes there and back?
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.500]   Again, you do the buyback rate.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.700]   Yes, perfect.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.020]   Use a different service.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.540]   Some people are just not willing to ask.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.420]   I'll give you a real example.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.660]   Last year, Christmas time, I had my executive team
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.600]   in my hometown.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.860]   We did an offsite and I wanted to give them a gift.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.300]   So I called the store that I wanted
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.180]   to buy all the stuff from.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.060]   And I said, "Look, I need six gift bags put together,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.420]   but I need you to deliver it."
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.460]   And they're like, "Well, we don't do that."
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.600]   I go, "I know you don't do that.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.720]   And I totally understand why,
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.820]   but look, we're going to be at this restaurant.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.180]   And the only way this is going to work
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.740]   is if you guys can put it together,
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.160]   bring it to the restaurant,
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.700]   have them put it behind the counter
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.340]   and just put it on my name.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.260]   And then when I show up, it's there."
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.220]   And I share that, Chris,
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.780]   because some people just would not even ask to do that.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.740]   And I said, "Look, if you need to charge me an extra 10%
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.020]   or whatever, please do it."
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.420]   But I knew the store where their location was
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.700]   and where the restaurant was walking distance.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.820]   It takes six minutes to just take the bag, bring it over.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.380]   They get a multi-hundred dollar order.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.700]   And I look like I'm super thoughtful and kind
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.620]   because I got them this cool bag
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.740]   that had their names on them.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.700]   I just think a lot of people just don't even ask.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.680]   They don't value their time enough
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.180]   to then ask people that have companies
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.700]   and would love more revenue to say like,
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.500]   "Hey, if you could do this and this, I'll pay you more.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.440]   You know what your buyback rate is."
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.300]   And a lot of them will just say, "Yes."
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.580]   It's like, "I actually drive by that neighborhood
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.620]   every day when I come home.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.120]   So yeah, if you want me to drop it off."
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.620]   We did this with meal prep.
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.060]   I remember eight years ago, my wife was freaking out
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.700]   because we have two young kids and I'm working.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.460]   I had a venture-backed company.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.660]   And I was just like, "You don't need to make dinner.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.260]   I love you and I know you want to make me food.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.940]   Not gonna change my life if you're not the one cooking."
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.900]   And the way we did is I was at the farmer's market.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.020]   There was this guy that we'd buy these frozen meals from.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.640]   And I was just like, "Hey, would you make these
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.820]   during the week and just drop them off at my house?"
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.900]   And he's like, "Well, we don't really do that."
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.900]   I go, "I know you don't really do that,
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.040]   but maybe you could start
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.380]   and I could be your first customer.
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.660]   Here's where I live."
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.500]   I've even done it.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.820]   There was a meat guy I did the exact same thing with
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.260]   that I wanted him to deliver his meat.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.860]   Like you were saying, you're at a meat store earlier.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.300]   But he was like, "I don't really do that."
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.420]   And I said, "Well, what if you had six or seven people
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.540]   that you were delivering on at the same time?"
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.380]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.260]   And I go, "Cool."
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.480]   I just called my neighbors up and said,
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.380]   "Hey, are you guys willing to commit
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.000]   to this level of purchasing from this meat guy?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.020]   You guys all know this store and you like it.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.060]   And if we do it, then he'll deliver it."
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.540]   And they were like, "Wow, you can get them to deliver it?"
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.700]   I'm like, "Yeah, no problem."
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.980]   I'm just a very resourceful, I ask,
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.660]   I'm creative about how I find ways to get my time back.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.980]   - It's funny you bring up the meat store.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.380]   There's this amazing meat store in Millbrae, California,
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.740]   near SFO called Pape Meat.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.460]   I learned this morning on the plaque on the wall,
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.140]   it's the oldest business in Millbrae.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.740]   And we needed a particular type of meat, guanciale,
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.980]   which is the meat you use for carbonara,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.540]   which is what we're gonna make for Christmas Eve dinner.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.300]   - Oh, now you're making me hungry.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.620]   - And if you go to their website,
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.800]   they do not discuss delivery on the website.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.900]   There's not like an easy way to get the meat.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.580]   However, this is all I had to do.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.820]   I searched deliver Pape Meat.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:57.020]   And this other website, Towne.io,
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.420]   definitely some kind of startup, delivers for them.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.180]   Unfortunately, because it's Friday and I need it tomorrow,
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.900]   and it's the weekend and the holidays,
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.520]   that wasn't an option this day
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.380]   with my poor advanced planning.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.740]   But in general, I could have had it delivered,
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.260]   not because they did it.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.480]   And I'm sure if I called, they would have said,
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.180]   "Oh no, but this other website does it for us."
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.460]   So even just this year, "Oh, I need to order this thing.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.580]   Let's just search to see if there is a service
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.580]   out there that delivers."
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.340]   So I would just say, I now learned that there's this.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.540]   - Yeah, most people don't search.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.080]   - Don't assume that because their website
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.100]   doesn't say they deliver, doesn't mean they don't.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.780]   And obviously for restaurants,
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.660]   there's plenty of apps that we all know about,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.700]   but there are alternatives like that.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.300]   We started using ButcherBox,
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.860]   which delivers actual meat
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.660]   and all kinds of stuff to your house.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.300]   So we get fresh meat
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.220]   and talking about two different services.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.940]   Sorry, Pape, we can't buy all my meat.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.900]   - No, and you're allowed to do that, right?
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.500]   You can use Instacart for certain things
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.300]   and you can use other services
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.820]   for like the weekly reoccurring.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.460]   It's really just being open
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.940]   to spending the time to figure it out.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.620]   I remember my buddy Nick was frustrated
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.300]   'cause he just bought this thing off some online site.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.580]   This furniture showed up and then he's like frustrated
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.700]   'cause he got put together.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:07.820]   And he literally was like,
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.220]   "I showed up just to say hi."
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.260]   And I was like, "What are you doing?"
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.380]   'Cause this guy runs a successful business.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.540]   I'm putting together this furniture.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.020]   I'm like, "Why are you doing it?"
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.980]   He's like, "Oh man, I don't wanna sit down
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.020]   and try to find the time to do the thing,
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.380]   to find the person, to hire them.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.660]   Like I might as well just do it myself."
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.140]   And I go, "Totally get it.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.260]   In this circumstance, makes sense.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.700]   But you need to consider the next time."
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.380]   So yes, the first time you do it,
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.780]   it's work to find a solution,
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.860]   but it's not that time you're actually trying to buy back.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.300]   It's the dozens of times this year
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.260]   that if you find a handyman
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.460]   or you use TaskRabbit or use whatever service,
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.140]   you find a trusted resource
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.700]   that you can pay to come and do those types of work.
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.740]   Yeah, it's a little bit more work today,
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.780]   but down the road, then all of a sudden
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.460]   you have this list of resources where it becomes easier
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.060]   and you can even get it scheduled
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.500]   and part of your lifestyle.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.380]   Even the meal prep, I remember telling,
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.740]   again, I have a house manager,
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.980]   so I know I live a privileged life.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.740]   But if it was me, I would have done the same thing.
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.500]   I went and found a nutritionist
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.860]   that partnered with a meal prep company
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:20.220]   so that they could take care of all of the food prep
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.580]   so that I would hit 99% of my time.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.300]   I'm hitting my macros, I'm hitting my nutrients,
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.220]   I'm hitting what I need for my health.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.540]   So it's like, some people look at that and they go like,
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.380]   "I can't believe you're paying $16 a meal."
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.940]   And I'm like, "You don't realize how much time I'm saving
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.420]   and the compliance."
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.580]   Like, this is the other thing is know thyself.
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.300]   I don't want decision fatigue
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.180]   by deciding what I have to eat.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.460]   I want that taken care of for me
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.740]   so that I know I'm going to be healthy.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.940]   I know that the meal is made
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.060]   and it's gonna hit all the macros that my trainer gave me
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.140]   and all these things.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.100]   And then that way I can take that decision power or energy
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.100]   and give it to something that's actually required.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.780]   It's why you see people like Zuckerberg
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.420]   wear the same clothes or Steve Jobs or all these people.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.540]   The more you can take the decisions out of your life,
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.020]   then the more energy and time you're gonna have
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.820]   to actually create and produce more.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.780]   And that's another big part that people don't consider
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.580]   when you use these services
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.700]   is just you're freeing up your mental bandwidth.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.540]   I don't know about you,
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.380]   but I'm using the new year as an excuse
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.460]   to get fitness back in my routine.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.620]   And if you're gonna work out,
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.980]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.500]   which I think is Viore.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.420]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.820]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.820]   Everything is designed to work out in
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.220]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.940]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.820]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.780]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.780]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.260]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.700]   And it's not just for men.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.260]   My wife, Amy, is just as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:57.180]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.180]   I have a few pairs
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.020]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.300]   I've ever owned.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.460]   I also love my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.500]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.860]   and they could be used for just about any activity,
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.180]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.660]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.500]   or their Meta Pants can even work for a night out.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.540]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:21.860]   And for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.460]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:29.260]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.900]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:33.940]   at allthehacks.com/viore.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:38.940]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/viore
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.580]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.660]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:48.100]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.340]   is online and in the last few months,
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.920]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.060]   and my info as possible.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.940]   I also did the same for our parents.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.060]   And in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.060]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.340]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.300]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.500]   And instead of spending 50 plus hours
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.820]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.340]   it only took a few minutes
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.420]   because I used Delete.me from Avine,
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.180]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.420]   with them for this episode.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.220]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.500]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.300]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.420]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.060]   and get that removed as well.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.980]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.360]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.860]   in their first two years.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.740]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.680]   for their customers.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.240]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.220]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.260]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:53.780]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:57.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.540]   I just wanna thank you, Quik,
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.860]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.680]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.140]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.700]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.020]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.340]   You talk about your house manager.
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.620]   I'd love to understand, just 'cause it's a concept
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.140]   I don't think everyone knows,
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.780]   first, what that person does,
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.180]   and obviously I know it's probably a luxury
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.620]   and a privilege to have that,
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.260]   but I also wanna talk about ways
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.860]   that some of what they do might be things
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.280]   that people could start to put into place
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.100]   with a virtual assistant or something like that.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.340]   And for context, I've thought for years
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.820]   about whether I ever was gonna hire a virtual assistant.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.360]   I've been collecting tasks over the last few months
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.320]   that would have been great opportunities to outsource,
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:53.500]   that any individual one was not big enough for me to say,
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.100]   oh, let's go hire a person so that,
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.620]   for example, one was,
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.980]   we were thinking of doing a gingerbread baking party,
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.660]   like where we'd make a bunch of gingerbread cookies,
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.540]   have people over, and it's like, oh,
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.100]   it'd be really great if someone wants to find a recipe,
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.780]   figure out how to batch it for 30 people,
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.100]   go on Amazon Fresh, order all the ingredients,
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.780]   and have them delivered.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:17.740]   It would probably not take that long, maybe half an hour.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.380]   I would probably take me even longer,
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.780]   'cause I'm sure I would try to get caught up
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:23.140]   on what is the absolute best gingerbread recipe,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.380]   and the average person would probably not spend
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.260]   as much time as I would,
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:28.220]   so it'd probably save me even more time,
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.100]   but I wasn't gonna go hire a virtual assistant
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.500]   for that one task.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.060]   So maybe talk to me about the house manager,
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.340]   and whether you think a virtual assistant
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.540]   could take on a lot of that,
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:37.700]   and whether that's something regular people,
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.620]   at the low cost you can get them now,
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.460]   should be considering.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.020]   - I'll start with the administrative assistant type of task,
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.820]   because that's super approachable, right?
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.460]   Like we live in a world where there are services out there,
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.140]   if you search like virtual assistant,
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.300]   task management, et cetera,
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.220]   where you can pay per task,
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.300]   or by the hour, the 15 to $20 type range,
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.220]   or hire somebody in another part of the world
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.900]   for $4, $5, $6 an hour,
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   it is absolutely approachable for every person out there
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.880]   in the world we live in,
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.260]   because there's these like companies
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.940]   that have built this technology.
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.620]   The key though, is to actually do the calendar audit
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.020]   to find out what are you doing with your time
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.500]   that is more administrative in nature, that is repeatable.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.620]   'Cause what I want to encourage people to consider
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:30.060]   is find the cadence of repeatable tasks
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.940]   that you can insert a person into your life,
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.940]   then they're available to do the things
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:36.140]   you just talked about, Chris.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.460]   If I have to think of finding another person
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.820]   to do a one-off thing, that feels heavy.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.420]   If I already have somebody in my life
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.780]   that's working five hours a week for me,
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.940]   managing research projects, or buying stuff online,
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.020]   or scheduling my travel, or taking information
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.780]   from this system and putting in this system,
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.860]   like every person that has a job
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.520]   probably does some type of work
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.640]   that isn't really rocket science,
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.380]   and you could just give to somebody else.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.040]   Sometimes it's just collecting data,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.740]   it's putting stuff in a graph,
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.500]   it's post-production of social media stuff,
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.340]   or whatever it is.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.500]   Then you start with the reoccurring things,
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.860]   or the person's part of your life,
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.980]   and then you can give them the one-off stuff.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.420]   The way I've always looked at it,
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.900]   and what I teach in my book is,
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.900]   I always start with the calendar first,
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.220]   because that's where I'm going to start buying back time.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.660]   And in the early days, it's usually task-based.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.020]   A lot of the stuff we talked about,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:33.460]   from lawn service, to cleaning, wash and fold,
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.940]   meal prep, project management, it's all task-based.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.620]   And that's okay, you just start there.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.380]   And you have five or six different people
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.980]   doing different types of tasks.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.380]   And then eventually you say, "You know what?
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.720]   "I don't want somebody separate cleaning my car
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.560]   "and cleaning my house,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.380]   "I'm just gonna have one person do that."
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.820]   And you kind of consolidate.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.780]   So if you think at the lowest level,
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.620]   every person listening to this,
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.020]   start with a budget,
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.060]   challenge yourself to buy back some time,
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.020]   and just know that you can have two or three people
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.620]   supporting you in different services or whatever.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.700]   And then what happens over time is you realize
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.740]   that there's a communication overhead,
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.180]   a management overhead of managing these things.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.600]   And that's what happened for us.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.900]   We had the house cleaner, we had the chef,
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.780]   we had the lawn care people, we had all these different
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.780]   people supporting our home.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.580]   And then when I looked at my calendar,
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.860]   because my wife and I both run companies,
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.100]   I realized there's a lot of work I was doing
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.980]   of just managing stuff.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.440]   I'm talking about going to the DMV and registering cars
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.900]   and calling my insurance company
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.740]   and maintenance on our homes
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.220]   and just transferring vehicles, literally everything,
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.720]   putting boats in storage.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.860]   I understand how privileged of a life that I have,
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.580]   but these are things that were still on my plate to do.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.620]   So on Saturday morning,
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.180]   instead of going mountain biking with my friends
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.060]   or deciding to say yes to putting our kids into soccer,
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.060]   I'm doing all this other stuff.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.760]   And sometimes I just wanna recharge.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.140]   I wanna sit down, I wanna read,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.700]   I wanna work on supporting our community.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.020]   My wife and I are very involved in the unhomed community
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:08.860]   in our city.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:12.860]   I'd rather go do that than manage a spreadsheet
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.980]   of making sure that we have the right insurance
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.500]   on all of our assets.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.380]   So we got to a place where we just decided to hire somebody
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.940]   that was the CEO of all of our personal stuff.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.380]   Now, again, I've had an executive assistant for a long time,
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.860]   for almost 10 years,
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.720]   but that person doesn't live in our home
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.740]   and is not in our home and not doing personal stuff.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.740]   They're managing the business side of my life,
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.700]   tasks, purchasing, travels, all that stuff,
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.900]   inbox, calendar.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.140]   Then we essentially rolled up all of the other stuff
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.500]   to one person.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.460]   And now we have one person, she's incredible.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.180]   And we set up a rhythm where every Monday
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.980]   I have lunch with her, we talk about the week,
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.820]   we talk about the tasks, we're eating together.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.740]   So it takes no time for me.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.540]   Every Wednesday, my wife and I,
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.180]   my executive assistant and her get on a Zoom call.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.460]   We call it the house meeting.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.020]   And we review, we have an agenda.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.460]   We review the projects,
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.220]   we review what they're working on, the playbooks.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.540]   And Chris is kind of crazy about it.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.860]   I have an SOP.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.900]   I have a playbook, handbook for the Martell family.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.060]   And in there is...
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:13.900]   What does that mean?
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.060]   Yeah, walk me through what that looks like.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:15.900]   It's awesome.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.740]   It's everything.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.340]   It's who are our babysitters.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.500]   It's the names of the people,
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.380]   that's the kids, school, principal, contact info, the vet.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.060]   Think about all the contacts.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.460]   So that's all in there.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.860]   All of our preferences, all in there.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.340]   Size of my shoes, my favorite colors for a t-shirt.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.180]   It's kind of crazy.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.860]   Even just the preference file,
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.340]   where I like to sit on a plane, all these things.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.700]   Then I never have to make the decision again.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.100]   You ever register for an event
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.540]   and they ask you the same questions every time?
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.580]   I don't do that anymore.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.860]   My assistant or my house manager asks us once
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.020]   and then she writes it down.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.940]   Everything is in a Google document, right?
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.500]   I think we're moving everything to Notion right now.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.340]   Even the...
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.100]   So we have a pretty cool sauna that does infrared
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.020]   and salt therapy and all these things.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.540]   And it's got a procedure for like
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.300]   how to schedule it to turn it on,
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.540]   how to reconnect the red light system.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.860]   And it's all in the playbook
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:13.220]   so that if I need to do it because it's a Sunday morning,
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.060]   I literally Google sauna and I find the playbook
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.540]   and I go to the section where it says,
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.580]   reset the red light system.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.940]   And I follow seven different steps to reset.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.100]   Like it's all in there.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.140]   Logins are all in one password
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.380]   and it's all under the house vault.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.580]   So it's like, I'm in my backyard
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.580]   and I need to get into a door that's got a lock.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.620]   We change all of our locks to pins, like an Airbnb.
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.740]   Why? Mobile.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.300]   Remember I said that, it's gotta go mobile.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.460]   So all the locks are all mobile enabled
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.820]   and all the numbers and the codes are all in one password.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.660]   And it's literally,
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.580]   we've created this kind of like procedure for our life.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.780]   Again, Chris, I'm sharing this
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.180]   'cause I wanna inspire people.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.180]   I also know I may infuriate people.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.540]   Like when you show people some of the super cars
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.940]   in a lifestyle and flying,
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.020]   like all this stuff, they can either be inspired by it
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.620]   or they're gonna be like, this guy's a douche.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.100]   And I totally get it.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.660]   I'm sharing this to hopefully inspire people
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.740]   that there is ways for you to incorporate this
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.660]   into your personal life
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.340]   that allow you to increase the quality of life you have
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.300]   and most importantly, create jobs.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.300]   A lot of my clients that struggle with this,
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.460]   that don't feel worthy of having somebody
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.580]   to that level of support,
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.860]   I just tell them, look, you can go buy,
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.100]   'cause this is what they're doing, Chris.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.980]   They're going and buying the new Mercedes or the new BMW.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.420]   I watched them do it all the time.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.540]   My neighbors, I watched them do it.
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.020]   The new car comes out, they went and bought it.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:37.140]   Okay, or you could stop complaining
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:38.820]   about not having enough time.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.780]   And instead of buying the new version,
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.180]   just keep the current one for a couple of years,
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.380]   hire somebody to manage your life
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.220]   so that you have the time to recharge
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.180]   or go increase the value in the market
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.180]   to pay three times over the new car.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.540]   It's so fascinating for me to watch,
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.500]   even in my world, friends of mine
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.340]   that struggle with their time
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.780]   and yet they don't understand
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.860]   where they're allocating their resources,
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.700]   their money.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.500]   So pretty much if it would show up on my wife
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.700]   or my to-do list,
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.940]   it is owned by our house manager, Betty.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.780]   And we tell her all the time,
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.740]   you are the CEO of our lives.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.460]   We do not manage our things.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.420]   You manage them.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.700]   You create the playbooks.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.060]   You take care of schedules and cadences
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.740]   and assets and relationships and all that stuff.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.780]   And then we just create a reporting structure
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.900]   where we get the information we need on a weekly basis
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.100]   to keep us informed.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.140]   So we feel like nothing's getting dropped.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.460]   So it's no different than you would
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.900]   for an executive assistant in your business life.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.620]   You just do the same thing for your personal life.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.060]   And it all evolved from having
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.340]   a bunch of individual things.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.940]   You start small, yes.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.380]   It's funny, two things came up.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.140]   One, I've been pushing,
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.500]   there was a company called Trustworthy
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.340]   that I invested in,
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.020]   which is kind of building the family operating system.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.420]   And it started as like the central repository
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.060]   of all the information about your life.
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.460]   So here's our house, here's our bank accounts.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.140]   And if I were ever to pass away,
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.020]   I have my sister and another person
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.940]   set to be able to access it, they know.
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.900]   But now they've started adding things like,
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.340]   for our house, here's our landscaping company,
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.620]   or here's our internet service provider or something.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.820]   So they're building a software alternative
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.700]   to Notion or Google Doc for this.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.420]   I love it, because most people don't know
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.380]   what information they should be collecting.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.180]   So their coolest thing is when you onboard,
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.940]   they're like, all right, go put in your old tax returns.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:28.780]   All of it.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.060]   Go link your bank accounts.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.900]   Here's your insurance policies.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.300]   And for your benefit, they have a mobile app.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.420]   So Amy and I know that if we're at the doctor's office
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.220]   and they're like, where's your kid's insurance card?
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.860]   We know, open the Trustworthy app,
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.740]   here's the insurance card.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.980]   We get pulled over, show me your proof of insurance,
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.300]   open the app, here's our Geico card.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.180]   We know where all of the things are.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.380]   Dude, it's crazy.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.660]   Think about how much time you're saved.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.020]   Like the other day, we had our meeting on Wednesday
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.140]   this week, and one of the projects
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.820]   was get my wife's passport renewed.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.220]   Do you know how many of my friends end up at the airport
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.180]   and their passport's expired and they can't go on a trip
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.940]   or miss a speaking gig?
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.020]   It's bananas.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.860]   And why?
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.540]   'Cause they feel like I'm supposed to manage this.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.380]   It's my life.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.220]   I need to manage my life.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.740]   It's like, when you actually give it to somebody else
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.820]   and you say, please treat me like a child,
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.980]   I am okay with that.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:19.100]   'Cause that's literally what I tell her.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.980]   I'm like, I want you to just assume
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.860]   that I'm not that intelligent.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:28.100]   And I want you to track the stuff, everything.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.940]   And you tell me when it's due or just do it.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.780]   And we'll build a rhythm for communication reporting
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.820]   so that I know, and then that way it's all there.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.140]   And like all that stuff you said,
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.740]   like the insurance, your wills,
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.020]   it's essentially like creating in a high net worth
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.300]   individual, they'll usually have like a family office.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.940]   You're creating the infrastructure
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.220]   for your own like personal family office for your life.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.180]   Even having a shared one password vault
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:59.180]   for your family's wifi logins and other online services
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.940]   is just a good idea.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.100]   I feel like you would absolutely love the product.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:04.940]   I'm checking it out.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.780]   I wrote it down, yeah.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.180]   I'm looking at it right now.
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.420]   And it says, renew driver's license
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.220]   because I already gave them my driver's license info.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.700]   It says, trustworthy will alert you 120 days
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.460]   before your driver's license expires.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.860]   Renew passport, trustworthy will alert you nine months
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.100]   before your passport expires.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.820]   So by putting the information in,
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.220]   you get this reward of like,
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.940]   hey, passport's expiring in nine months.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.060]   I don't have to think about it anymore.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.260]   I know that for all of our kids,
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.380]   I'm gonna get an alert nine months
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.020]   before any of those passports expire.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.380]   It relieves the mental burden of me having to think about.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.580]   This is an example of, because you're on the journey
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.620]   to try to find ways to buy back your time
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.100]   and you look at like where you've had friction in the past
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.340]   and you found a service like this.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.380]   So some people might hear about the house manager
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.300]   and go like, that's crazy.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.980]   I could never afford that.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.220]   Think about there's tools out there.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.500]   30% of what she does, the software automates it.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.380]   And I talked about that.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:57.380]   It's like automation.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.100]   I just feel like people need to really challenge themselves
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.780]   to value their time, to go on the journey, to build it.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.060]   Yeah, it takes work.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.260]   I'll actually give a real tactical thing for people
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.980]   if they're still like on the edge and they haven't done it.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.180]   This guy, Jack Canfield,
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.780]   he wrote a ton of bestselling books,
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.020]   bestselling author, like good dude.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.500]   He talked about creating this thing
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.940]   called the frustration list, 'cause it's a muscle.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.940]   And his argument was most people don't even see frustrations
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.100]   in their world to see opportunities.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.060]   It's a muscle you have to develop.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.140]   And his argument was like,
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.860]   as you go through your day in your home,
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.540]   think about things that frustrate you, okay?
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.580]   And just make the list.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.780]   I'm not asking you to solve the problem, just make a list.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.740]   So it might be, I'm downstairs working out
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.620]   and I don't have a cable to charge my phone.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.220]   Literally just write it down.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.780]   Like don't have a cable to charge my phone.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:51.100]   Or you get in your car and you realize you ran out of gum
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.340]   and you like this certain type of gum and it's not there.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.180]   Okay, write it down.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.980]   Or it's like, you get out of the shower
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.860]   and you don't have a hook for your towel after you dry off.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.460]   It sounds crazy, Chris,
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:05.260]   but I want people to do that for like two or three days
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.100]   because two things, one, honor those frustrations
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.820]   and build a muscle and a routine of solving those problems.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.180]   Make the list and actually wake up on Saturday morning
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.100]   and say, "Hey, I'm gonna work through this list
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.340]   and just see if I can be creative
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.660]   about how I solve this stuff."
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:21.980]   Some of it could be simple, like buy another truck.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.220]   And even that, it sounds so nuts, dude.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.020]   People won't even give themselves permission
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.540]   to own two cable chargers for their iPhone.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.380]   So there's one next to their bed and one in their office.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.140]   Like, isn't it weird, Chris, that they're like,
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.860]   "Yeah, no, I don't deserve that."
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.740]   - If anyone listening feels they don't deserve,
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.580]   I think I have like 20 extra iPhone chargers in my house.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.860]   I will gladly send you one.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.060]   - Of course, because you're like,
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.940]   "Hey, I wanna have the things that I need
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.900]   and I'm willing to pay for extra stuff
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.300]   so that it doesn't become a point of contention."
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.300]   Because what's worse is if you're in,
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.820]   like I do some back country skiing.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.820]   If I'm in trouble and my phone is dead
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.100]   because I didn't charge it when I should have charged it,
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.580]   that's a bad circumstance.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.020]   So I just really wanna encourage people to realize
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.220]   that if it doesn't feel natural to you right now
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.740]   to identify things in your life
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.980]   that you should be trying to buy back your time on,
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.460]   it's a muscle that can be developed
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.300]   by just writing down the things that are frustrating
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.340]   or not optimal.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.780]   Some of you guys are like, "I love life.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.700]   That's not a frustration."
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.900]   Look, just in a perfect world, wave a magic wand.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.860]   If you could live a perfect life and you go through life
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.460]   and everything's awesome, how would it look?
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.460]   Make that list and try to create that.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.300]   - Love it.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.340]   We've gone through a lot.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.660]   However, there are a few random things
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.420]   that I want to touch on before we go.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.420]   I think next year will be the year that I get started
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.060]   with trying to actually hire someone
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.420]   to help outsource a lot of these tasks.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.620]   I need to hire a virtual assistant to help me go research
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.020]   the best virtual assistant services.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.700]   I'm not ready for someone full-time yet.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.820]   But there are a few things that as I've listened to you talk
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.860]   and as I've done my homework and just known you
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.340]   that you've done that I think maybe don't fall
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.540]   exactly perfectly into buying back your time
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.860]   and the conversation we just had,
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.220]   but I think are worth running through
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.620]   because I think people will find a lot of value out of them.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.260]   One is on designing your perfect week.
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:06.180]   One is on thinking about the seven pillars of life.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.180]   And let's start there and then I'll get to the rest.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.860]   Cool. The perfect week.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.100]   And I actually have a diagram in my book
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.700]   that I put in there because I wanted people
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.820]   to actually see what that looks like for me.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.820]   I think it's on page 141.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.380]   It's literally the diagram.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   What's important is to design all the big rocks
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.500]   into your life so that you actually understand
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.980]   that you do have the capacity.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.420]   A lot of people go like, "I don't have the time."
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.420]   That's cool.
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.700]   Let's talk about that.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.860]   But let's just start by saying,
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.740]   "Okay, here's a seven-day template I give people."
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.220]   They buy the book, they go to the website
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.700]   and I give them the template.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.500]   Then they make a list of all the important things
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.460]   in their life, like spending time with their kids,
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.220]   going to the gym, their work, their creative stuff,
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.780]   their hobbies or whatever.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.620]   And then you take that and you put it into the calendar
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.980]   and you block them in.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.660]   The big stuff, it's like, "Go to the gym every day.
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.500]   What time do you want to go?
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.540]   It's an hour or 90 minutes, put it in there."
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.100]   And what I think people will realize
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.700]   if they go through the exercise
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.500]   is there is actually enough time in a week
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.580]   to do everything you want to do.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.060]   You just have to now then honor the calendar.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.860]   And the reason why I encourage all of my coaching clients
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.700]   to do this is because if you have the rhythm
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:24.180]   of your week designed, then when you hire somebody
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:26.780]   like a virtual assistant to support you,
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.420]   they know where certain things go
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.860]   so they don't have to bug you.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.540]   It actually is not efficient, Chris.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.220]   If you have somebody that's managing your inbox
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.100]   and your calendar and helping you
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.580]   with scheduling meetings and stuff,
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.060]   to have to ask you every time,
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.460]   "Hey, are you okay doing a meeting
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.460]   at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon?"
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.620]   Versus, "Hey, these are the two hour windows
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.060]   each day that I do meetings.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.420]   So if a meeting comes in, just put it there."
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.260]   I'll just give you an advanced tip on that
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.740]   for a virtual assistant.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.780]   We do three levels of priority.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:58.340]   So I'll sometimes do a P1, P2, P3 in the email reply.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.900]   A P1 means cancel something to make it happen
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.140]   at priority level.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.460]   P2 is make it fit as soon as possible,
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.060]   but don't cancel anything.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.860]   P3 is within the next two weeks.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.260]   And P4 is don't rush if it happens cool.
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.660]   If it doesn't, no harm, no foul.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.300]   Even just trying to create these systems and language
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:23.020]   around how you work with somebody to manage your calendar
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.580]   is important, but it all starts
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.940]   with designing the perfect week.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:27.940]   Does that make sense?
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.220]   Yeah, I was just actually thinking about some way
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.140]   that you could secretly encode that into your email
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.980]   so you reply to someone.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.060]   Here's how I do it.
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.900]   I leave an email draft and I write it in the draft
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.060]   so she sees it 'cause she's in my inbox.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:43.900]   Ah. Yeah.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.060]   Yeah, if someone's in your inbox,
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.420]   all my head could think about was like,
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.580]   "Oh, what if I had this secret code where I had a signature
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.020]   and if I end it with an exclamation point?"
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.620]   Looking forward to hanging out.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.300]   So you could do signature, enter,
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.260]   and put it right at the bottom and nobody even sees it.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.300]   Or different, you're onto the same pattern of the language.
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.340]   So it's like, "Can't wait to meet" means this.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.220]   "Looking forward to talking soon"
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.980]   means you can add that as a language signature.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.580]   It was superhuman they have these snippets.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.020]   So that snippet could be called P1.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.580]   I know that I just write P1
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.700]   and then it posts this line that means...
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.140]   Boom. So I love it.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.380]   The seven pillars of life.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.220]   Talk about it.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.060]   Seven pillars of life is a way
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.620]   that I create a feedback loop for myself
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.140]   on how I'm showing up in my life
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:31.780]   and at least creating a point of reflection to improve it.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.940]   And the reason why I designed this is a long time ago,
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.660]   I went through a challenging time with my fiance
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.900]   and that didn't work out.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.100]   But then I got married and I don't know about you,
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.380]   but people get divorced and it's crazy.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.100]   And you're just like, "Why do they get divorced?
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.700]   Why are they having challenges in their lives?"
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:52.380]   And typically it's because there's a fracture
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.620]   and then the fracture lasts for weeks and then months
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:56.820]   and then eventually a year.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.940]   And the fracture ends up creating such a wide divide
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.940]   that they can't repair it.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.940]   So what I've done is across these seven core pillars,
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.500]   it's actually a bonus chapter.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.780]   I wasn't even gonna include in the book
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.500]   and my editor was like, "Hey, I really think
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.540]   the seven pillars would be a great tool for everybody
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.180]   to just wrap it all up."
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.060]   And every Friday morning, I sit down for 30 minutes.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.380]   It doesn't even take me 30 minutes.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.180]   It takes me like five or six.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:24.140]   But I rate myself out of 10 on these seven pillars.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:24.980]   It's a spreadsheet.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.500]   I've been doing it for years.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:30.460]   And the seven categories are health, hobbies,
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:35.460]   spirituality, friends, love, finance, and mission.
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:38.460]   And I do those ones because they encompass
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.700]   kind of like how I wanna show up in the world.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.820]   Spirituality is important.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.060]   It doesn't matter if you believe in God
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.180]   or whatever God or the universal consciousness
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.700]   or spirit or energy, whatever it is,
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.460]   just asking yourself, do you have a relationship?
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.780]   Are you spiritual?
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.940]   Are you meditating?
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.780]   Whatever it is.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.100]   And like just giving yourself a rating on those things.
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.300]   Finances, like a lot of people,
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.540]   they don't wanna talk about money.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.940]   They don't pay attention to their money
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.660]   and then they wonder why they have none.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.140]   Or like hobbies.
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.620]   People are like, "Oh, hobbies must be nice."
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.860]   It's like, look, all I know is that
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.700]   after I go snowboarding with my buddies,
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.020]   I'm a better dad, I'm a better husband.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.500]   I recharge, I connect, I wanna do those things.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.860]   So what happens is I score myself on those seven pillars.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.700]   I'll actually give you today's.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.020]   That's always better, real time.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.820]   So today I scored myself pretty high.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.340]   I'm having a good time right now.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.660]   My two lowest scores, one was friends
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.100]   and the other one was hobby.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.540]   So here's the bonus one of this.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.060]   I got an eight and a seven.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.500]   I always write in the spreadsheet a note on how to fix it.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.820]   So the hobby one is book a snow biking.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:40.540]   So I do this crazy thing called snow biking.
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.380]   And then the friends one is low,
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:45.260]   but the good news is I go snow biking with my friends.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.060]   So I'm gonna get a double whammy.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:48.140]   And all I did, the action,
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.180]   that's why I give myself 30 minutes to do this.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.860]   I just made a list of all the dates
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.420]   that I'm free to go snow biking.
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.780]   And then I sent a text message to my five friends
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.140]   that I go snow biking with and says,
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.180]   "Hey guys, can we just schedule
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.540]   one of these days to go snow biking?"
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.700]   And I've accomplished it.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.820]   Literally, it's that simple.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.820]   It's just every week I assess myself
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.340]   on those seven dimensions.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.260]   I take my two lowest scores.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.340]   If it's love, 'cause I haven't been there for my wife,
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.820]   it might be, then I set a commitment to take action
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.100]   in the next seven days.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.740]   And that one might be like schedule a date night,
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.180]   give my wife night off on Monday, let her take a bath,
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.020]   whatever it is.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.260]   And because I do that, Chris,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.700]   I just feel like I get to live a higher quality of life
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.420]   because I'm not trying to fix things
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.020]   because there's a fracture that's been going on way too long
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.620]   around not seeing my friends or not taking care of my health
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.260]   or not focusing on my mission or whatever it is.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.460]   And it's been a big part of my life.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.300]   - I love it.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.740]   And on the topic of relationships,
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.020]   the last thing I wanted to chat about,
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.940]   you hired a coach to live with you
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:47.660]   and help the family and build deeper relationships.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.100]   For those of us who aren't gonna do that right away,
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:51.300]   or it's not in the budget,
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.700]   what lessons did you take away
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.020]   that maybe we could steal from you?
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:54.860]   - So many.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.860]   Her name is Brooke.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.340]   She is a angel.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.860]   We've been working with her for three years.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.300]   I'm just a big fan of hiring people
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.060]   to increase the caliber of our life in different areas,
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.460]   from fitness to business to our family.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.660]   We got to the point where Brooke and I,
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.460]   it's fun because she'll have private calls with my wife
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.460]   and she'll have private calls with me
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.860]   and then we'll do a group call.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.300]   But it got to a place where I was like,
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:18.060]   "I think there's another level of opportunity,
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:22.460]   but I think you'd have to see us instead of hear us."
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.460]   'Cause you think about it, Chris,
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.580]   it's like explaining to somebody what happened
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.980]   is like you recounting the situation.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.740]   It was always like their version, your version,
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:31.620]   and then the truth.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.660]   Versus them being in the room, seeing it,
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:37.140]   and then they get to get their interpretation.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.820]   So I literally offered to fly her up.
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:40.860]   She lived in California
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.460]   and she came and lived with us for three days.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:44.980]   She slept in our house, lived in our home,
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.300]   woke up in the morning, watched the morning routine.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.940]   So it was really fun to have her get a new level of insight
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:54.460]   into what all the conversations we were having
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.940]   meant in a real world scenario.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.180]   The things that I learned personally was
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.380]   she did some incredible work with my wife
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.580]   around reconnecting with her feminine.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.260]   You'd have to ask my wife about the impact it had on her,
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.380]   but I got to see it.
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:09.140]   She did some dancing when she asked, she invited me.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.300]   She's like, "Do you want to do it with us?"
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.180]   And I'm like, "I'm here to play Fallout."
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.060]   So 7 a.m. instead of going to the gym,
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.620]   I sat down and I danced with my wife and Brooke
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.700]   and it was pretty crazy, man.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.340]   Just like understanding how women's physiology
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.900]   and their feminine side of their connection
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.860]   is just part of it.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.700]   It's kind of crazy.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.540]   It's not what men do.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.700]   Men scream and charge off into war.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.300]   And again, it's masculine versus feminine.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:37.860]   It's not even a gender thing, but that was a big takeaway.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.260]   She worked with our kids.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.620]   So she did some exercises with our kids
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:45.020]   to understand the way they were building their worldview.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:46.500]   And what was important to them.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.060]   So she made them draw a picture of their family.
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:50.980]   You kind of see this in therapy sometimes.
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:53.100]   But then we had some issues, dude.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.940]   It was really cool.
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.020]   My oldest son had a meltdown.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.820]   So she got to see how we responded to it
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.620]   and then gave us some cues.
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:03.660]   She explained to my wife that these things are 100% normal.
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:05.860]   So it allowed her to feel less guilty
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.580]   about those things happening.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.220]   If you don't have an external perspective,
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.660]   you sometimes think like, "This is the end of the world
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.660]   and I'm such a bad parent because this is happening."
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:15.180]   Having an expert come in and say,
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.020]   "Oh, actually, that's super normal.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.300]   You handled that really well.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.220]   Here's why.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.420]   And in the future, if you want a little bit of coaching,
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.300]   do this."
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.140]   For me personally, sounds crazy.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:30.780]   I learned that my wife likes to tell me about her day,
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.220]   not because I'm going to have a test at the end of it.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.140]   So I have to remember everything,
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.140]   but just because it's her way of decompressing
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.940]   at the end of the day.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.020]   So this was a huge win for me
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.020]   because I now prompt it.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.900]   Where before I was scared of it,
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:47.980]   because I was like, "Oh my gosh,
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.860]   she's going to sit there and talk for 20 minutes
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.140]   and I don't know.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.420]   Am I supposed to help?
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.420]   Am I not supposed to help?
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:54.940]   Why is she telling me all this stuff?"
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.100]   And now I go, "Hey, babes, tell me about your day."
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.780]   This is literally the last thing we do every night
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.060]   because Brooke explained to me what was happening
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.940]   and that I'm not going to be tested
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:08.380]   and I'm not supposed to do anything other than listen.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.220]   So I will tell you,
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.980]   it might sound simple for some of you men out there,
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.140]   you will be the best husband in the world
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.420]   if you say, "Hey, babes, tell me about your day."
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.100]   Wow, that sounds tough.
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.100]   Tell me more.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.260]   Literally that language, "Tell me more."
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.580]   Game changer.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.980]   So that was big.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.780]   And then just really how to show up for your partner.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.180]   Some physical things.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.740]   Like a lot of women, they want to feel safe.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:34.660]   They want to feel seen.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.140]   They want to feel appreciated.
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.380]   That was a big thing.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.700]   This one that I think my wife really took away is,
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.100]   men hate to be criticized.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.020]   I don't know if you've ever had your wife criticize you
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.500]   or do it in front of another person.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.140]   There's certain things that are just like,
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.900]   for whatever reason, is really challenging.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:55.140]   Once she saw it and got some cues on it,
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:57.700]   it just changed the way we show up in public.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.580]   We worked on this.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.980]   There's a book, I can't remember the name of it.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.060]   This is another big one and I'll leave on this one
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.300]   is "Launchings and Landings."
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.620]   So she taught us the value of a launching and landing.
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.180]   I'm so driven by time,
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.660]   as you guys can all hopefully pick up,
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.900]   that I'll just like run out the door.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.660]   It's like, I'm leaving, going to the gym.
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.340]   I just ran out the door.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.340]   She said the two most important things
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:18.780]   you have to get better at as a couple
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.340]   is launchings and landings.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.540]   Meaning that when you leave,
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.260]   it is a deliberate go find the partner.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.620]   Hey, I'm leaving now.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.700]   I'm going to do this.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.380]   I will see you when I get back.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.460]   And then when you land, it's I'm back.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.940]   Here's what I did.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.500]   Do you need me for anything?
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.220]   And it might sound crazy.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:38.860]   We actually taught it to our kids.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.540]   Even before I come into my office in the morning,
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.260]   'cause I have a home office,
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.980]   I go and I do a launch with my kids
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.140]   where I give them little kisses
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.340]   and I tell them about them and say,
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.260]   I'm going to my office now, da, da, da, da, da.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.220]   And we call it a launch.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.940]   And then when I get back or at the end of the day,
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:54.580]   if I'm done early, I go find them and I land with them.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.420]   I'm like, hey, I'm done, da, da, da, da.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.780]   And they actually say, I'm launching too.
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.820]   And they'll tell us about them going to do stuff.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.540]   So I just think it's those little tweaks, right?
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.220]   In life, it's never about these big moves.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.380]   It's these one degree, these two degree changes.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.180]   And then when you follow that trend line
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.780]   over five, 10, 25 years,
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.580]   they have these huge pieces of impact on your life.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.580]   - So two things I took away, no Irish exits in the house.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.620]   That's for parties only.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.060]   But also I've just learned to get better about communicating.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.580]   Sometimes there's a person in a relationship
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.300]   that takes the mental burden of everything
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.500]   that has to happen.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.700]   And if you don't communicate that you're doing something,
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:35.900]   they feel like it's their responsibility to do it.
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.340]   So for me, if I don't say,
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.860]   hey, I am still planning on doing X,
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:42.380]   my wife might assume, oh, maybe you're not gonna do it.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.340]   - Emotional shrapnel saved.
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.940]   - All right, we went through a lot.
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.020]   We're way over time.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.700]   I got an advanced copy of the book.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.540]   So I've already read it,
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.860]   even though by the time anyone listening is listening,
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:52.700]   it will be out.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:55.140]   I highly recommend, you've got three on your bookshelf.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.060]   I was like, I'm gonna maybe have a bookshelf
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:57.900]   in this new studio.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.540]   Now I need to go get a physical copy.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.940]   I only read the digital copy.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:04.820]   But definitely tell everyone where they can find it,
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.220]   who it's for and everything,
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:07.260]   and where they can find you.
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.980]   - Yeah, book is designed for people
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.740]   that obviously want to become better time trader.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.060]   It's called Buy Back Your Time, buybackyourtime.com.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.740]   It's available on Amazon.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.580]   If anything I shared today serves you
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.220]   and you end up getting the book or whatnot,
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.140]   I would love, love, love a review on Amazon.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.540]   I'm working with my team to create a movement
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:27.180]   around business and executive level performance
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.580]   and just really help people understand
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:32.820]   how to build a life they don't grow to hate.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.500]   That's like my biggest thing, Chris.
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.380]   I just don't want people to go after
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:40.300]   this achievement lifestyle or this success ladder
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.300]   to just find it leaning against the wrong wall
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.140]   because they just don't know how to think about
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.700]   the energy and the time
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.740]   and just getting more of their life.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.540]   So that's why I created it.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.900]   It's been two and a half years of love and sweat
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.300]   and frustrations and just putting everything into it.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.060]   Yeah, I'm really proud of the book.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.540]   And the hardcover is cool.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.180]   And I'll tell you why, Chris, if you get a copy,
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.500]   you should get the physical copy.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.500]   I actually got my signature.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.820]   Take the jacket cover off.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:09.500]   I designed the whole, like people never see this stuff,
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.540]   but I cared about it and I'm really proud of it.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.500]   But yeah, buybackyourtime.com.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.340]   Awesome, and what about you?
