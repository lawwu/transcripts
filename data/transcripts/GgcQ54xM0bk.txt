[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.740]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.040]   We are continuing our discussion on God,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.760]   guns, and biblical manhood
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.540]   that we started back in episode 306
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.280]   and picked up last time in episode 317.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.560]   There's more to say about guns and biblical manhood,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.040]   especially for those in law enforcement and the military.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.760]   Pastor John, pick up your train of thought
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.040]   from yesterday's episode.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.960]   - Last time, Tony, I raised the question,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.760]   is the possibility of someone going to hell,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.360]   if you kill him, a sufficient warrant for not killing him?
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.600]   And I answered no.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.560]   This question today is,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.360]   is the New Testament commandment,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.680]   not to return evil for evil,
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.880]   a sufficient warrant for a Christian
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.500]   not to be a soldier or a policeman?
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.720]   And the reason that seems so relevant
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.880]   and several of our policeman friends asked it,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.800]   is that the New Testament is filled
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   with statements to this effect.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.040]   This is Romans 12, 14.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.200]   "Bless those who persecute you.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.400]   "Never avenge yourselves.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.200]   "Leave it to the wrath of God,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.340]   "for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.560]   "'I will repay,' says the Lord.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460]   "On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.520]   "If he's thirsty, give him something to drink,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.960]   "for by so doing, you'll heap burning coals on his head.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.140]   "Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.320]   Now, the question is, when a policeman reads that
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.800]   or a soldier reads that, should they say,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.380]   "Well, I guess I've got the wrong job
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.160]   "because I'm not waiting for God to take vengeance.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.840]   "I'm involved in it right now.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.400]   "I am returning evil for evil, harm for harm.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.040]   "I am not turning the other cheek with my billy club.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.560]   "I don't give to him who asks
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.800]   "to let him go on beating that woman.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   "I hit him and stop him."
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.600]   And so my answer to the question,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.840]   "Do those texts prevent a person
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.480]   "from being a policeman or a soldier?"
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.720]   is no.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.980]   In fact, I would go further and say,
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.980]   God has arranged that the spheres that make society work,
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.720]   all of them have God-ordained situations in them
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.060]   that demand that we not turn the other cheek.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.400]   The spheres I have in mind are the state,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   the family, business and commerce, the church.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.520]   God has built in to each of these spheres
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.300]   the necessary principle of justice,
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.800]   not just the principle of mercy,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.640]   where you treat people better than they deserve.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.760]   In other words, treating a person as he deserves,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.260]   as well as sometimes treating him better than he deserves,
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.260]   is essential for the loving, just working of these spheres.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.160]   Let me just give you four biblical examples.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.200]   The state, Romans 13, four,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.960]   "He is the servant of God, an avenger,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.760]   "who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer."
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   So he's talking about soldiers and policemen there
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.280]   who carry the sword.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.460]   They don't turn the other cheek.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.460]   They do strike in order to defend the fatherland
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.280]   or to defend the innocent citizen
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.720]   who's a victim of a crime.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.540]   So state.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.360]   Number two, commerce, business.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.500]   Paul said, 2 Thessalonians 3:10,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   "If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat."
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.900]   That's not mercy, that is justice.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.380]   The employer does not turn the other cheek.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.620]   If a man doesn't come to work day after day and says,
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.700]   "I just don't feel like it," he gets fired.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.980]   He gets paid less.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.980]   You can't run a business without the principle of merit,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   without the principle of a day's work for a day's wage.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.860]   Thirdly, family.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.060]   Fathers, bring up your children
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.900]   in the discipline of the Lord.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.460]   Parents who only turn the other cheek
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.500]   and do not return spanking for insolence,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.100]   breed brats, not pacifists.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.820]   And the Bible is so clear.
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   Parents have the right to operate on the principle of justice
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.260]   as well as mercy.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.220]   You have to spank your children, discipline your children.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.840]   Number four, the church.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.140]   Church discipline.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.840]   1 Corinthians 5:5,
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.860]   "You are to deliver the man over to Satan
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.620]   for the destruction of the flesh
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.020]   so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.740]   In all of these, we're hoping for the good of people.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.500]   But in the short run, we are not giving to him who asks,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.380]   we're not turning the other cheek,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.100]   we are returning some measure of harm
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.180]   because of behaviors that were harmful or wrong.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.380]   So the point is this,
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.380]   each of these teachings of the New Testament
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.380]   show that a just and loving society
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.540]   inside and outside the church
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.500]   requires more than not returning evil for evil.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.580]   It also requires, in the spheres where God assigns it,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.520]   a principle of justice that returns what a person deserves.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.260]   So my answer to the question is no.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.740]   Is the New Testament commandment
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.020]   not to return evil for evil
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.980]   a sufficient warrant for Christian
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.100]   not being a policeman or a soldier?
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.560]   No.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.940]   Both of these,
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.900]   that is, treating a person according to justice
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.620]   and treating him according to mercy,
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.900]   are essential in bearing witness to our God.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.700]   Just like I said last time,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.660]   in our personal Christian readiness to suffer
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.620]   and be cheated without vengeance,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.700]   we display something utterly crucial about God.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.180]   He's our all-satisfying treasure,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.420]   and he will reward us fully in the end,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.380]   and he will settle all accounts at the end of time.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.700]   And secondly, when we function as a policeman or a soldier
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.020]   or a parent or an employer or a church elder,
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.180]   we also apply the principle of justice
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.900]   and display something else about God,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.740]   namely, he has ordained that even in this world,
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.020]   even in the church,
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.020]   there be a limit to evil and a display of justice.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.500]   So there's just no doubt.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.900]   I mean, I realize as people are listening to this,
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.380]   they're saying, "Whoa,
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.340]   those two principles are gonna collide."
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.460]   (laughs)
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.020]   They are going to collide in my life.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.160]   And my answer is absolutely they're gonna collide.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.940]   This way of living creates tensions.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.420]   They bump into each other,
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.720]   and that's just the way it has to be,
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.700]   it seems to me, in a partially redeemed world.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.540]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.580]   I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.060]   And this is the third podcast that we've done on guns.

[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.700]   something you've been talking a lot about recently,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   Pastor John, and specifically,
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.400]   what's new about New Calvinism?
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.660]   That's coming up on Monday.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.100]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
