[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.800]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.240]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.720]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.880]   Today we continue our 7 Rings of Freedom series.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.040]   We're on ring number 4, spending liberty.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.160]   And in this series I'm talking to you about some specific things that you can do that
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.000]   will enhance your personal liberty.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.680]   My goal is liberty, freedom, because when people start to pursue financial independence
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.780]   I'm convinced that a majority of the reasons why people are pursuing financial independence
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.040]   come down to some expression of freedom.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.440]   Perhaps freedom over time, perhaps freedom over association, perhaps freedom over purpose,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.800]   over direction.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.640]   And there are some things that you can do while you're on the path to financial independence,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.720]   which of course is going to take time, many times years if not decades, that will lead
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.000]   you to a lifestyle of freedom so that you enjoy the process.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.440]   And today we're talking about spending liberty.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.600]   Now this is part 2 of the show.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.800]   In part 1 I talked about the value of being debt free.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.360]   And today I want to talk about the value of having savings.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.920]   And you would say, "Joshua, it's obvious, right?
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.080]   If having savings is valuable it's going to give you more freedom."
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:56.440]   But I want to point out to you that you can achieve freedom with less than a million dollars.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   And I've spoken about this before but I want it to be in one particular show where I want
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.840]   to talk to you about how even a small amount of savings, but savings that you can get your
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.620]   hand on, can open up to you freedom.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.360]   Now I want to make sure that you're debt free because being debt free will give you huge
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.280]   amounts of freedom.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.980]   But when I closed out the debt free show I made the statement that you also have to supplement
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.640]   being debt free with having a little bit of savings if you want personal freedom.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   I use this example.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.200]   I said, "Let's assume that you have $10,000 of credit card debt and you have $10,000 of
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   savings.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.160]   Now are you more free if you take the $10,000 of savings and pay off the credit card debt?"
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.960]   My answer is you're probably not more free or at least you're not more free if you can't
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.500]   quickly replenish some of that savings.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.800]   The example would be this.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   You're working in a job.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.080]   The job is not a great fit for you but you get a job offer on the other side of the state
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040]   in a place that you would enjoy living and it's a great job offer for you.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.520]   You're renting an apartment and you need to move out of this apartment.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.760]   But if you take the $10,000 and you pay off your credit card debt and you have no cash
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   you can't make that move and you can't take the job offer.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.320]   You might have to break your contract which means you may not get your security deposit
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   back.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.400]   You may wind up owing your current landlord an early termination fee on your contract
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   of some kind.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.200]   And now you're in a situation where you have no money to pay first, last and security on
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840]   another apartment.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.800]   So if you took your $10,000 and you paid off all your credit card debt, yeah, that's good
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.080]   and you're now debt free but that didn't actually get you much more freedom because now you
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.760]   can't move to take the new job offer.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.240]   So you wind up going back into credit card debt in order to have money.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.960]   So in that situation having $10,000 in the bank and simply having the obligation to pay
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.420]   $100 a month on your credit card gives you more freedom because now you have freedom
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.640]   of choice.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.400]   So being debt free is something that you should set as a goal and should pursue.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.080]   But along the way you're going to find that savings and having money saved is going to
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.720]   be extremely valuable for you.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.360]   Now I can't tell you exactly the order that you should pursue this.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.280]   If you're in a contented job, you feel like you're in a good living situation, etc. and
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.120]   you're paying off debt, I say pay it off.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.320]   Do Dave Ramsey's plan.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.060]   Save $1,000 in the bank and put everything else extra on the debt.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.200]   Pay it off fast.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.720]   But recognize that savings are going to give you additional levels of freedom.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.560]   One of the things I have observed is that most people don't ever experience the joy
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.160]   of actually having money.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.400]   There are surveys that are done and basically you'll find that about half of Americans can't
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.920]   put their hands on $1,000 if they needed to without borrowing money.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.020]   Now what's silly is that that doesn't mean that half of Americans don't have a net worth
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.020]   of more than $1,000.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.080]   It's that they can't put their hands on $1,000.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.720]   And one of the weird things that has happened in the modern American society is that a lot
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.760]   of our money is tucked away where we can't get a hold of it.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.000]   We can't have it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.840]   In some ways that's a good thing.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.280]   I found over the years that in order to help me control my spending, it's a lot of times
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.320]   good for me to put a little distance between me and my money.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   That helps me to spend less money.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.420]   There's a principle there that's really true.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.640]   But when you don't ever have money, then you don't ever feel rich.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.400]   You might have $100,000 in equity in your home, but that money's hard to access and
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.360]   hard to spend.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   You'll feel far richer as an individual and feel far more freedom about your future if
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.040]   you have $100,000 in your savings account and $0 of equity in your home than if you
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.240]   have $100,000 of equity in your home.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.760]   Because what'll happen is if you try to get the money, the $100,000 out in a home equity
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.160]   line of credit, which you could do, you'll feel like you're going into debt.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.200]   Whereas if you have the money in your savings account, you'll have access to the money.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.920]   Things like retirement accounts come into play as well here.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.200]   Where so many people have money in retirement accounts, but they don't think about it as
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.160]   part of their liquid assets.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   Is that a good thing?
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.000]   Again, a lot of times you might have people who have problems with their spending and
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.360]   they put money in their 401k and that's good for them because otherwise they'd spend it
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.040]   all.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.600]   In one sense, you could say it's good to have a little distance between you and your money.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.800]   But then you find people who have 30, 50, 100, 300, a million dollars in their 401k
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.640]   who are doing things like working a job they don't like or living in a house they don't
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   like.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.440]   And you look at it and you say, "Why on earth do you have all this money saved up for retirement
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.000]   when you're living in a situation that you don't like?"
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Change your living situation.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.880]   And many people don't stop to think about, "Hey, I could change this."
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.460]   That's silly.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.520]   Is it good to save money for the future?
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.280]   100%.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.040]   But don't ignore the present either.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:25.360]   Find a way to live a great life now in the present while also saving for the future.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.960]   And don't sacrifice one excessively for the other.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.560]   They're both important.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.300]   What I've learned over the years is one of the best ways to feel rich is to have a little
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.560]   bit of money.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.320]   It's silly, but it's true.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.400]   Let me add the next part of that sentence that makes a difference.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.960]   What I've found over the years is that one of the best ways to feel rich is to have a
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.940]   little bit of money that I can touch.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.000]   Some money close to hand.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.600]   Some money that's not locked away.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.640]   And I want to encourage you to save some money.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.080]   And not to save all of that money in a place where you can't get it, but to save it in
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.280]   a place where you can.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.320]   In my opinion, there are three numbers that you should set as a savings target.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.080]   You can put this on your goal list.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.440]   Many people can do it, but there are three numbers that you should set as a savings target.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.440]   These are round numbers.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   I can't scientifically prove them, but I think they're right.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   You judge for yourself.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.300]   The first number is $1,000.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.520]   You should save $1,000.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:49.320]   If you are a young person just getting started, if you are only earning a low income, something
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.960]   you're in a difficult situation, what you will find is that having the ability to lay
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:04.660]   your hands on $1,000 will move you away from that base level of poverty.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.540]   It will allow you to be insulated from a majority of those bad things that can just create a
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.680]   snowball wrecking effect in your life.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.320]   $1,000 will fix most car problems.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.420]   If $1,000 won't fix your car problem, $1,000 will get you a new car.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:30.160]   Things like that are a big deal in many people's lives.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.880]   What happens is most of us, we start to earn a little bit more and the wealth, the net
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.380]   worth and the earning level of the radical personal finance audience is astoundingly
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.320]   high, but it's not all astoundingly high.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.840]   I just want to encourage you, for those of you who are not at a massive net worth or
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.040]   a very high income, set a goal to save $1,000 and make that a very high priority.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.920]   Do whatever you have to do.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.600]   Little bit of extra work, pick up an extra gig, decrease your expenses, be radically
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:08.000]   frugal for a time, do whatever you need to save $1,000 because $1,000 will be a useful
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.440]   buffer between most things that happen in life.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.840]   Again, some of the most important ones would be things like a medical bill.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:23.280]   Many people get sick, go to an urgent care place, $1,000 will solve the problem generally.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.240]   Not everything, obviously not, but a lot of things.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.960]   Go sick, $80, $100, $200.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.880]   Those are the kinds of expenses when someone is just getting started that if they don't
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.520]   have them, they wind up starting to be in debt.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.200]   They wind up owing medical debt.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.640]   They wind up with credit card debt, and then they get behind in something else.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.360]   Whereas having $1,000, always having $1,000 will start to save you hugely.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:54.400]   $1,000 will allow you to live and to get by in most difficult situations.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.160]   Let's say you only have $1,000, but you lose your job.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.880]   If you've got $1,000, we can work out a plan.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.400]   You may have to move, may have to abandon the apartment, et cetera, but if you've got
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.000]   $1,000, you can make a plan.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.960]   I could live, even as a father of four children, I could live on $1,000 in a month if I had
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   to.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.680]   It'd be not so fun.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.000]   It wouldn't be great.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.200]   I may not be living in the house where I live in, but I could do it, and you could do it
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   too.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.680]   That $1,000 buys you time to get another job.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.280]   What happens is often if you study people who are deeply in debt, who are stuck in poverty,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.240]   there are little things that happen that a little bit of money would help them to avoid.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.360]   They lose a job.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.400]   Because they don't have a job, because they don't have any money, they can't put gas in
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.040]   a car and go to another job.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.560]   Then they wind up going to a high-interest loan shark of some kind, where they wind up
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.160]   owing debt, and they have a credit card.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.680]   They get behind, they get behind, and it starts to snowball.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.720]   Because they have a bad credit score, then they can't rent a good apartment at a cheap
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720]   rate, et cetera.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   It just goes on and on and on.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.520]   I don't want to belabor the point too much, but simply to say that if you're just getting
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.360]   started, $1,000 should be your first goal.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.160]   In addition, because there's two sides to savings, number one is the emergency buffer,
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.760]   $1,000 solves many problems in life, but also $1,000 starts to open up opportunities for
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.000]   you.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.800]   It starts to allow you to do things that other people can't do.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.520]   These opportunities allow you to take advantage of opportunities in life.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.400]   Perhaps you're living in a place where you don't have a job, but yet you have a cousin
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.280]   or a friend who posts on Facebook.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.960]   Maybe you just randomly come across on Facebook or on YouTube some video of a guy talking
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.680]   about how much money you can make in the Texas oil fields.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.320]   If you got $1,000, you can get yourself to Texas.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.760]   $1,000 will rent you a minivan for a couple of weeks.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.480]   You can live in the minivan, and $1,000 will give you gas to put in the minivan so you
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.280]   can drive from, I don't know, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Houston, Texas.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   If I were on the edge, that's exactly what I would do.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.440]   I would go and I would rent a minivan, possibly buy one for $500, but maybe you need a little
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   bit more than that.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.960]   I would rent a minivan, and you can rent a minivan as long as you rent it in a place
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.760]   that's not a tourist destination.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.920]   You could rent a minivan for a couple of weeks for a few hundred dollars.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.520]   I'd go to—if I were that broke, I wouldn't go buy an air mattress.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.380]   I'm going to say go buy a $10 air mattress, but if I were that broke, I'd just get some
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.920]   cushions from a couch that somebody threw away on the side of the road, put the cushions
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:37.160]   in the back of the minivan, fold all the seats down, and I'd drive to Texas, pick up some
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.820]   cheap food along the way at the grocery store, grab a little stove with a little butane stove
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.040]   that I can cook on and a frying pan from Goodwill or something like that that I can cook on,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.200]   and I'd go get myself a job in Texas in the oil fields.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.080]   A thousand dollars means you can always do that.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.040]   Those are the kinds of things that when I think about it, especially as a father, I
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.280]   think, "Okay, what if I lost my job?
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.520]   What if I were out on the street?"
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   I'd send my wife and children to go live with family.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.680]   I'd rent a minivan or I'd borrow a minivan or I'd buy a minivan.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.640]   If I could find a $500 one and I'd drive to Texas and I'd go get a job in the oil fields
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.440]   or some other version of that.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.920]   You have opportunities to increase your income through good employment.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.440]   That's life-changing for a lot of people.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.520]   Thousand dollars will start to allow you to take opportunities of buying things that you
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.480]   need that are a good deal.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.240]   Number of years ago, I bought a car, a Toyota Corolla, paid $500 for it.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.840]   It was owned by a little old lady that I knew.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.560]   She drove it for a lot of years, but she didn't like driving the manual transmission.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.920]   She was getting a little older and she wanted to buy a car with an automatic transmission.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.880]   The car was worth about $1,000, but it was in terrible shape.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.680]   She was happy for me to pay her $500.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.280]   I fixed a couple of things on it and cleaned it up.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   She was happy.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   I was happy.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   I paid $500 for that car.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.360]   That car is still going strong.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.000]   I sold it after a few years for $1,000, but the car is still going strong.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.680]   It's the kind of thing that's perfectly reliable transportation.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.280]   1998 Toyota Corolla, four-cylinder, manual everything.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.680]   I love that.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.480]   If I didn't travel so much, I'd still have it just as a car around, an extra car.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.200]   It had zero repairs, nothing.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.600]   Nothing has gone wrong with it because there's nothing to go wrong with it.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.920]   That's why I bought it.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.640]   The reason I'm saying that, the point is, when you look at people who are really just
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:32.600]   getting started, a lot of times they make short-sighted decisions.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.680]   Things like buying cars that are not reliable just because it was available.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.640]   A lot of times it's done to financing.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.360]   You go down and you go to the buy here, pay here lot, and you buy a car for $3,500 that
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.640]   the dealer paid $600 for on a trade-in, but you finance it through the dealer.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.120]   Then you wind up buying a car that's just simply not reliable.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.260]   A lot of the cheap cars are not reliable.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.100]   The problem is that you can't predict when those inexpensive little cars come along.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.160]   It's one thing to buy a car from somebody that you know, a little old lady that you
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.720]   know who is getting rid of this car that she's had for 12 years, and you know everything's
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   going to be fine on it except for the stuff that I can clearly see.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.800]   I see that this is broken, this is dirty, et cetera, and you can just simply buy it
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.840]   confidently.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.880]   That's very different than going to a car lot and buying that same car that you know
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.840]   nothing about the history of it.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   It's not nearly as safe of a bet.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.200]   You can't make those things be produced all the time.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.160]   When you see a deal like that, it's kind of like Costco.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.500]   When you see a deal at Costco, you got to buy it now because you know they're going
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.200]   to get rid of it in two weeks and that's their whole scheme.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.080]   Deals like that, you got to buy them now.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.120]   When you come across somebody who's selling a boat and they need the money this weekend,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.160]   you got to buy it now.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.960]   You can't wait, you can't think about it, you got to buy it now, which means you need
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.040]   money.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.920]   Having a thousand dollars can help somebody to have a backup car or it can help somebody
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.120]   to have reliable transportation so they can get out of a bad car alone, something like
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   that.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.000]   A thousand dollars starts to get you to those opportunities.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.680]   Now, I want you to have more, but I want you to understand a thousand dollars gets you
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.280]   options.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.440]   A thousand dollars starts to allow you to take advantage of bulk buying.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:16.360]   One of your biggest cost-saving measures is to be able to do bulk buying.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.780]   Instead of buying small packages of things at high retail prices, you buy large packages
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.680]   of things.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.980]   If you eat candy bars, get a friend who has a Costco membership to allow you to go into
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.920]   Costco with them and buy a box of them instead of buying them at the convenience store.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:39.200]   If you need food, go and buy big bags of rice and beans and a big box of chicken and set
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   it aside.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.080]   If you look at the way that many people run their finances, because of limited available
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.000]   money, limited cash flow, often they're paying the most expensive price for food.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.920]   One of the basic skills that you have to learn to develop in your financial journey is to
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.720]   lower all of the costs in your life.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.080]   I used to do construction.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.480]   I've worked construction.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.200]   I've worked on a farm.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.840]   I've done lawn maintenance.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:14.160]   I've worked with a lot of blue collar and sometimes low income workers.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.620]   One of the most astounding things to me is how somebody who's making $10 an hour can
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:25.060]   afford to buy gas station coffee, can afford to buy gas station drinks.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:33.380]   If you go to most places during lawn care season, if you go to most fast food restaurants,
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.300]   you'll see landscaping trucks and whatnot parked there.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.860]   Usually the Spanish guys, all the Latino guys are usually a little smarter.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.720]   They've got tacos and beans and rice and whatnot from home.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.000]   But you'll often see, especially the native born Americans that are working in those kinds
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.740]   of jobs, buying fast food.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.740]   You can't afford it.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.900]   It's too expensive.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.340]   The first skill you have to learn is to change away from that.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.540]   You start to save some money and you put together your food.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.580]   You go and you buy a 20 pound bag of chicken.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.580]   You put that in the freezer.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.380]   It'll keep fine for months in the freezer.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.660]   Then you cook some up in advance.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.180]   Then it lowers your per meal cost.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:16.820]   Instead of spending $5 to $8 a day on gas station food, coffee, etc., it drops your
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.800]   total daily food cost to $1.50 a day.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.160]   Those savings add up big time.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.060]   But the $1,000 gives you the flexibility to start to spend it on that.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.120]   The very basic level, the first goal should be $1,000.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.360]   Save $1,000.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.720]   Then always keep that $1,000 available.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   That'll give you more freedom.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.640]   What about other freedom oriented things?
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.680]   Things like changing jobs.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.360]   Many people don't change jobs because they can't even go a few days without a paycheck.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   Sometimes people can't even go a week without a paycheck.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.680]   $1,000 gets you the freedom to change jobs.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.460]   And so when the pay periods don't line up, you have the ability to still cover what you
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.980]   need to cover.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:59.400]   If you don't have $1,000 right now to your name that you can get your hands on without
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.580]   borrowing it, it's a full emergency.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.140]   You should not eat.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.220]   Or you should not eat anything except rice.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:15.920]   Whatever the tortilla, corn tortillas, or rice, or flour.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.540]   You shouldn't eat until you get $1,000.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.960]   Don't do anything until you have $1,000.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.920]   And then resolve to never have less than that.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.100]   If you have to spend it, if you have an emergency, immediately replace it.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.860]   And go to full stop everything.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.860]   Turn off the air conditioner.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.740]   Cancel the cable.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:40.580]   Do everything to get you back to that $1,000.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:48.920]   Life below that number is simply far too risky.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.940]   It's too much uncertainty and you have no freedom whatsoever.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.880]   So save $1,000.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.860]   Now my only addendum to this would be if you don't have $1,000 on your person right now
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.720]   and/or within your ability to go among your belongings, your house somewhere, and get
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   the $1,000.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.920]   It doesn't have to all be on your person, but it probably should be.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.680]   If you don't have $1,000 on your person, then stop and do that.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.600]   So many people say, "I've got plenty of money in the savings account," but they don't have
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.560]   any money where they can touch their hands on.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.040]   And so for an adult of a decent earning, not at poverty level, et cetera, to not have $1,000
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:34.200]   on your person and/or in your effects, some in your car, some in your house, et cetera,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.420]   it's irresponsible.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.240]   It's crazy.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.400]   And yet in a credit card driven world like most of us live in, that's where most of us
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   are.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.520]   So you're behaving irresponsibly if you can't put your hands on $1,000 right now and you
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.700]   have it.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.760]   The only exception I'll make to that is somebody who's living in a very vulnerable situation,
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.800]   multiple roommates, high chance of theft, minimal personal belongings, very transient
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   situation.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.480]   In that situation, bury the $1,000 in a jar and put it in a flower bed somewhere.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.400]   Conceal it at a public park or something like that.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.200]   But make sure you can always lay your hands on $1,000 of cash.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   Now what's the next number?
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:20.400]   Well, for me, one of the things that no one told me about was $10,000.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:28.340]   And I had $10,000 saved for a very long time from a very early age.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:34.680]   But what I didn't have was $10,000 saved in a place where I could have it because I prioritized
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.520]   so much investment accounts.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.920]   And I was always setting the money aside, setting the money aside, and investing, investing,
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   investing.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.440]   And it wasn't until I was old, I don't know the exact age or I'd tell you, but it wasn't
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.120]   until I was older where I finally had $10,000 and I was like, "Wow, this is pretty cool."
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.040]   Because when I got $10,000 available to me in a savings account where I can just simply
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.600]   swipe my debit card and get it out, all of a sudden I felt rich.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.760]   And what I came to realize was that the majority of life-changing decisions that I wanted to
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.200]   make were within my grasp.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:18.120]   Now when you have $10,000, you are of course insulated from the vast majority of problems
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   in life.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.240]   Not all, but the vast majority.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:29.320]   It's hard for me to think of a problem that can't be solved and/or at least deferred for
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.120]   $10,000.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:38.080]   For most people, $10,000 would represent, especially people without debt or with minimal
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.520]   debt, for most people $10,000 would represent at least a few months of living expenses.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.920]   And if it doesn't represent a few months of living expenses for you, it could.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.980]   You might spend $10,000 a month because you have the money, but if you had to spend less,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.360]   you could do that.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.800]   You could live on $10,000 for a few months, especially if you don't have any debt or you
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.640]   have modest debt.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.360]   If you've got $5,000 a month student loan payments, can't help you.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.920]   That's what the last show was for.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.480]   But $10,000 represents at least a few months of expenses.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:15.080]   That's powerful because that starts to give people a sense of certainty and security that
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.840]   is really life-changing.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.200]   Now it doesn't represent six months of living expenses for all people, even necessarily
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.080]   for most people.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.600]   But there are so many people who are earning six figures, who are so deeply in debt just
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:37.240]   because they committed to a debt lifestyle, who when they first have $10,000, it's changing.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.640]   And there's so many people who are earning $30,000, $40,000 per year, who if they could
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.240]   save $10,000 would help them to start to feel rich.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.920]   So from a security perspective, it's fantastic security.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.400]   Again, what about those things that happen in life?
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.320]   The unexpected illness that somebody misses some work and misses some paychecks, $10,000
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.000]   protects against that.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.200]   Unexpected medical expenses, $10,000 protects against a lot of those.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   All of them?
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.200]   No, of course not.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   A lot of them.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.840]   $10,000 protects against the car accident that breaks down your primary vehicle.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:19.160]   Let's say that you're a tile setter, a construction worker for a living in some way.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.280]   And so you need a truck to carry your tools and all of a sudden you get hit this Thursday
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.840]   morning sitting at a stoplight by an uninsured motorist who runs away.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.760]   And now your truck is broken and you've got no insurance payout for it and you can't get
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.320]   to work on Monday.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.960]   $10,000?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.000]   Give me one day in any city in America and for $2,000 to $5,000 we'll have a reliable
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.920]   pickup truck or a reliable minivan or a reliable big van or a reliable station wagon, something
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.200]   that can carry your tools and you can be back at work on Monday morning earning an income.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.640]   That's so powerful.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:01.080]   $10,000 will bail you out of prison in most situations.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:07.960]   $10,000 allows you, your grandma dies and you've got to buy a last minute plane ticket.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:13.560]   $10,000 flies you across the country or across the world to go to grandma's funeral or to
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.800]   go and help an ailing parent, et cetera.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.360]   $10,000 allows you to be covered from most of those emergencies.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:31.800]   $10,000 also opens the door to any, I have to qualify that, to almost any, basically
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:37.000]   to almost any life change that I can think of.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.360]   Need to move from Miami, Florida to Seattle, Washington?
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.720]   $10,000 will do it.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.600]   So if you're just done with Miami, Florida and you want to go to Seattle, you can do
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   it.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.680]   $10,000 is enough to drive you there, cover the cost of gas, maybe a hotel if you need
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   one.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.520]   $10,000 is enough to pay first class and security on an apartment.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.840]   $10,000 is enough to float you for a couple of weeks while you find a job.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.800]   And so if you're trying to escape life in sunny South Florida and you want to move to
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.360]   Seattle, Washington, you can do it.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   $10,000.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.960]   $10,000 allows you to start so many businesses.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.080]   Not all, but so many businesses.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.920]   $10,000 will finance tools, equipment.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:26.600]   You want to leave your soul crushing corporate job and start a pressure washing business
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.280]   or a catering business or something like that, $10,000 is enough to get you in business.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   And this goes on and on.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:39.240]   I don't want to give too many examples, but almost any decision can be done for $10,000.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.760]   Even some of the big ones, you're stuck in Chicago, Illinois, you got a house, you got
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.240]   a mortgage, but all of a sudden you hear about an exciting opportunity in another state.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:55.280]   Again, $10,000 moves your family there, covers the mortgage for a month or two, allows you
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.320]   to paint the place, replace the carpet and get a tenant in there to cover your mortgage
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.080]   or it covers your mortgage for a few months while you get it on the market and try to
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.440]   get it sold quickly so you can move.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.680]   This is the kinds of freedom and opportunities that are opened up by having money.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:17.000]   But it's got to be money that you can touch, that you can get your hands on.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.600]   In addition, $10,000 allows you to take advantage of buying opportunities.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.840]   Now here of course the buying opportunities get a little bigger.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.480]   We're not worried about buying a 25 pound of chicken, pound bag of chicken at Costco
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.240]   to save money on lunches.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.280]   But you want to buy a boat?
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.600]   Well $10,000 and somebody who's watching Craigslist will create a great family boat for you anytime
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.440]   you want.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.680]   You can move down, move with cash, they got it listed for $10,000, you offer them $6,000,
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   here's cash, you might drive away with a boat.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.080]   $10,000 gets you great cars.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.960]   $10,000 allows you to buy an RV, use it for a while, sell it when you're done with it.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:01.320]   $10,000 opens up so much entertainment and fun and those kinds of things.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:07.880]   And what happens is that middle income people often have the money stuck in a retirement
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.440]   account, but they're stuck in the expensive middle income world.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.320]   So instead of going and buying a cheap boat on Craigslist to use for a few years and then
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.640]   flip it for net cost of a very little amount, they go and they buy a new boat with payments.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.280]   And that new boat they pay $25,000 or $35,000 or $135,000, whatever it is, and it depreciates
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.040]   drastically.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:38.160]   Instead of buying a reliable minivan for $8,000 or $7,000 or $5,000 or whatever, and then
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.400]   from time to time just simply replacing it every few years and going ahead and buying
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:48.480]   another one so they never wind up with an old one, they go out and buy a brand new one.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.160]   Depreciates quickly and wind up without any money.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.120]   Those are the kinds of decisions people make all the time.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.440]   Instead of figuring out a...
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.120]   I don't need to give any more examples.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.680]   With $10,000, it's hard for me to think of the thing that can't be done, especially if
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.520]   it's accompanied by debtlessness.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:14.800]   It provides dramatic safety, resiliency, a buffer from the majority of things that happen
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   in life.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.960]   You die, you don't have any life insurance, you leave behind a wife and five children,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:27.080]   $10,000, it's enough to buy a casket at Walmart, stick you in the ground in the family cemetery
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   plot, it's enough to allow her a few months to figure out who's going to watch the kids,
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.960]   it's allowed her to update her resume and go and get a job.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   It's a buffer.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.200]   It's a really, really important buffer.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:49.800]   As I close out and move on to the next number, I would emphasize to you that probably, unless
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:58.480]   $10,000 is the only money that you have, $10,000 is probably the kind of number of cash that
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:04.360]   you should be able to lay your hands on in a relatively short period of time.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:12.480]   Now maybe you walk around with $10,000 in your boot, some people do, but more likely,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.880]   it's just an amount of money that needs to be in your home safe.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.680]   It's an amount of money that needs to be in safety deposit box at the bank or split out
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.760]   in a number of different situations.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:29.840]   Again, I sometimes feel like I'm the number one advocate for cash, but I see so many people
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.760]   who have so much money who can't actually lay their hands on it if they want to.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.960]   And so your brother is, you know, your brother gets put in prison, you can go bail him out,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.920]   but you don't have the cash to do it, or your car breaks and you need a replacement this
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.400]   weekend, but you can't get any money out, so you wind up not being able to buy the cheap
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.160]   one on Craigslist.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.800]   That was one of the places where I first started to pay attention.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   I needed a minivan.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.000]   My wife and I were in an accident.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.240]   I wrecked one of our cars.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   We needed a car.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.920]   I was searching for a minivan.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.760]   I got a deal on one, went to look at it on Saturday morning.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   It was a great deal.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.560]   I think I paid, it was going to be like five or $5,500.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.200]   It was what I was looking for, but it was a few thousand dollars under market.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.760]   But it was hard for me to get my hands on the $5,000 that I needed.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.720]   And so I called the bank and was able to work it out.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.960]   They increased my ATM limits.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.200]   I went to half a dozen different ATMs and made all the ATM distributions, and I was
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.760]   able to get the money out.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.460]   But it made me realize how ridiculous that was.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.280]   How ridiculous is it that I can't just go and buy a minivan on Saturday morning because
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.920]   I don't have the cash, and I resolved, never going to happen again.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   I'm never going to have all my money stuck in a bank account and not be able to buy a
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.400]   minivan.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.840]   And so things like that are so valuable to be able to do.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.880]   And so you should have probably at least $10,000 secured in a way where it's protected from
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.480]   theft, protected from damage, et cetera, but it's available to you.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.520]   You never know when you might need it.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.900]   Never know when your accounts get frozen.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.840]   Never know when you might have bank errors.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.080]   I find more and more that I'm having more and more problems with my banks.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.440]   Now, it might be due to some of the weird things that I do and my weird travels and
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.560]   whatnot, but the amount of trust that I have in my banking institutions to release my money
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.280]   to me when I need it has substantially diminished.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.160]   And I've realized how vulnerable I am if I don't have cash.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.280]   Sat there and you're trying card after card after card, and something is flagged, but
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.600]   I can't get the message and I can't release it.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.440]   And so it's important.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440]   Pay attention.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.840]   Now, the third number in my list is $100,000.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.680]   And I can't defend that number again scientifically.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:02.840]   All I can tell you is, of course, it's a round number, but round numbers work for me.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:11.320]   But when I hit $100,000 in savings, not locked away from me, I experienced something that
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.000]   I never expected.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.680]   I experienced a sense of freedom.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.840]   And that freedom is something that I would never trade.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:29.320]   Because what I realized is, I have the ability to make the choices that I believe are in
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:35.040]   my best interest and my family's best interest without worrying about what anybody else says
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.880]   or does.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.720]   I have the ability to go anywhere in the world that I want to go.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:49.120]   I have the ability to do almost anything in the world that I want to do.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.480]   I have the ability to live in almost any way that I want to live.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.360]   Now, am I financially independent?
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.720]   Could I just stop working and never earn an income?
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.480]   No, I'm not.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.960]   But I never have to worry, as long as I have $100,000, I never have to worry about being
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.120]   destitute.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.040]   I never have to worry about being stuck.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:21.920]   I can't imagine the situation that I couldn't get out of in that circumstance.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.200]   I will concede that the $100,000 needs to be mixed with some frugal living skills and
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.160]   some flexibility of mind.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.200]   There are many people who, their mindsets are so rigid and so inflexible, they're not
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.520]   willing to ever make any sacrifices and they're stuck even with $100,000.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:48.480]   But for me, a man who possesses a fairly flexible mindset, who's fairly adept at thriving in
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.760]   different situations, the $100,000 means total liberty.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:00.640]   Can I go and buy a house in Miami, Florida for $100,000?
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.760]   No.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:10.240]   But if I need a roof over my head, I can go to Youngstown, Ohio, or I can go to Biloxi,
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   Mississippi.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.800]   I can pay $50,000 cash for a house, own a house, no mortgage, ready to go.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   Perfectly good.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   Suitable.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.440]   I'm not abusing my children by making them sleep in a minivan on the streets.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.280]   I'm in a good situation.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.200]   I can have a stable situation.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.760]   I can start all kinds of businesses.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.680]   And so if this business fails or another business fails or et cetera, as long as I've got money,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.220]   got $100,000, I can pivot.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:43.280]   I can pay personal expenses for years if I'm living frugally.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.920]   Six months, a year if I'm not.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.960]   But years if I'm living frugally and still have the ability to acquire equipment.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.600]   And what happens is you move into much more profitable businesses.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:01.960]   You buy a food truck trailer or you buy a snow cone equipment or I go and I start buying
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.800]   bounce houses to rent out, et cetera, or I do something online.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.520]   The world is open to you.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.640]   And so when you've got investment capital, is it enough to make you financially independent
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.120]   on the 4% rule?
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.760]   No, it's nothing.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.680]   It's nowhere near enough.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   Obviously not.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.760]   I can't live on the 4% rule on $100,000.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:29.120]   But what I can do with $100,000 is I can start a bounce house business that makes me $3,000
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   on a weekend.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.680]   It's fully or $2,000 on a weekend.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.800]   It's fully rented out because I'm running 10 bounce houses or 20 bounce houses depending.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.840]   And I can supplement that with somewhat something else, right?
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.120]   Electric cleaning business or something like that that's available to me, low barrier of
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.080]   entry but I just got to have some equipment and then I can make money quickly.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.280]   Now I can still be the master of my time.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.680]   I can still be in control of my schedule.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.720]   It's enough money that if I want to pivot and go and become educated for something new,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.280]   I can go and re-educate for something new.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   I can cover my living expenses for a period of time while I go back to school.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.000]   I can do whatever I need to do.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.320]   So there's a famous quote where Warren Buffett when he's talked about how much money he was
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.120]   going to leave to his children, he said, "I want to leave them enough money that they
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.760]   can do anything but not enough money that they can do nothing."
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.600]   And that quote is lauded as being very wise.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   I like it.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   I don't have a problem with it.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.440]   I think it's nice to leave, to provide for your children the opportunity that they can
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:40.360]   do anything but not so much that they can do nothing.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:47.080]   But as I've thought about applying that to financial independence, I'm presently convinced
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:58.760]   that $100,000 is enough money to do anything but not enough money to do nothing.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.000]   That's why I prioritize it so highly.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.720]   It's enough money to do anything but not enough money to do nothing.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:13.320]   Now I don't think doing nothing is anything to aspire to, which is why although I work
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.560]   towards financial independence and I want to encourage people to work towards financial
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.720]   independence, I think that the common goal of financial independence is this pivotal
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.600]   capstone thing is silly and short-sighted.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.200]   I think that financial independence should be a point along a journey and that your goals
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:34.760]   should go beyond financial independence while you look forward to reaching that crossover
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.040]   point.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.800]   If doing nothing is not the goal for Warren Buffett and his children, then why should
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:46.280]   doing nothing be the goal for you or for me?
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.040]   My opinion, $100,000 is the number.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:56.560]   It's enough money to do anything but not enough money to do nothing.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.840]   Now will I change my tune when I'm a millionaire and a decamillionaire and I don't know, centamillionaire
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.760]   and whatever it goes on beyond?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   Probably.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.120]   You listen to rich people talk about things and you hear them say funny things that you
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   can't even conceive of.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.200]   How can you live on $100,000 a month and things like that?
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:20.000]   But I appreciate the bluster and the bravado and perhaps that's how they really feel, but
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.040]   I can't find any logical reasoning to it.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:31.200]   If you've got $100,000 saved and maybe the income level is $100,000 a year, I don't know,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.920]   but basically there's a crossover point at which you can basically do just about anything
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   you want to do, just perhaps not with quite exactly the same luxury that you would do
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.200]   it otherwise.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:53.920]   I don't know what I can't do at this point in life that I could do if I had $100,000,000
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.600]   except do everything that I do now with more fanciness around.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.120]   There is a massive difference for somebody who's just starting out or somebody who is
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   very broke.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:12.340]   There's a massive difference between hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck versus having
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.680]   some buffer and some margin and some safety.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.400]   But once somebody has $100,000 in the bank and has a business that provides for their
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:26.120]   lifestyle, it's all just variations on the same theme.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.360]   You can go on vacation.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:33.280]   You can just go on fancier vacations when you're more, maybe longer, I don't know.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:41.120]   I think that $100,000 number is so doable for so many people that it should be the first
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.040]   goal.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.520]   It may take you 20 years to save $1,000,000, but it won't take you 20 years to save $100,000.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   Even on a modest income, you can save $100,000 quickly.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:00.120]   I just want to encourage you, if you don't have $100,000, set it as a goal and achieve
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.400]   it quickly.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.200]   One of the neat things about $100,000 is it can be achieved through a variety of means.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.840]   Can you save your way to $100,000?
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.680]   Yes, you can.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:17.160]   But you can also do something very simple like buy a house, live in it for a few years
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.080]   and sell it, have $100,000.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   You can possibly do it through some savings plus a little bit of part-time entrepreneurship.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:30.800]   Pick up a side hustle gig that makes you $1,000 on the weekend and pretty quickly, you've
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.560]   got an extra $100,000.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   Can you do that?
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   Of course you can do that.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.640]   There's lots of things that you can do to do that.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.600]   If you set it as a goal, you start seeing ways to achieve it.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.240]   Now, back to savings.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.400]   If you only have $100,000, should you save $100,000 in cash?
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   No.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.440]   That's far too risky.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   One of the major problems with cash, with physical currency that you have to be cautious
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.640]   of is through the risk of theft and the risk of destruction, loss through some other means,
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.960]   fire, flood, earthquake, etc., that kind of thing.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.320]   You want to make sure that you don't put your currency at risk.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:16.360]   There's a scale between $1,000 of cash versus $100,000 of cash where the risk that comes
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.800]   from not being able to put your hands on it versus the risk of loss, if that represents
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.600]   your life savings, is just simply far too substantial for you to turn the risk of having
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.000]   all that money in currency.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Don't do that.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   The next thing is, does the $100,000 all have to be in your bank account?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.980]   My answer is no.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.720]   It doesn't.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.240]   If you can put it in your bank account, you'll probably feel different.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.520]   I'm not opposed to 401ks, IRAs, Roth IRAs.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.520]   I think they should be used.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.000]   I think they're useful tools.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.920]   I especially like them as simply creditor protection tools, things like that.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:59.240]   I would not go to an 18-year-old or a 22-year-old who is working at a job and say, "You should
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.120]   not put money in a 401k until you have $100,000."
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.240]   I think that's silly.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.400]   I think you should put money in the 401k.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:10.160]   I think you should put money in the Roth IRA.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.080]   I'm being a little wishy-washy on this particular goal to try to account for some of those
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.200]   realities that I think need to be accounted for.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.040]   My number one priority for you is that you set it as a goal and that you achieve it because
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.560]   it'll be a point of freedom for you.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.200]   It'll mean that you can invest.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.640]   I skipped over all the investment opportunities, but are there investment opportunities with
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   $10,000?
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Yes.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   There's a lot more with 50.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.860]   With 100, though, you get to the point where you can invest in almost anything.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.320]   You can buy rental houses.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.240]   You can invest in pretty cool businesses.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.360]   You can buy franchises.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.000]   You can buy in with other people.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.620]   There's all kinds of things you can do that you can't do before.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.680]   That money needs to be available to you is the point, but even if it's all in a 401k,
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.680]   I'm okay with that.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:04.120]   I'm not okay if it's all in a 401k, but I'm okay if you're funding a 401k, but you're
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.800]   mentally moving it to money that's available to you.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.760]   The big point is for you to have money that's available to you, not money that's locked
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.900]   away in a mutual fund until you're 65.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:22.360]   What I would do if I were starting over at a young age, knowing what I know now, I would
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:28.080]   take advantage of things like 401ks, but I would put money in a Roth IRA.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.480]   What I might do is I might be slow to invest the money in the Roth IRA, meaning I might
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:37.120]   put it into the Roth IRA, but I might keep it in a cash account for a time just so it's
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.800]   stable, so it's not wandering around with the stock market.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.440]   I might mentally earmark that as my opportunity fund.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.040]   If I see something that I think is a better opportunity than mutual funds, I'll go ahead
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.920]   and take the money out and spend it on that.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.880]   Could be college education or college degree.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.960]   That's one option.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.920]   Could be a cheap little rental house for me to live in.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.200]   Could be a new car.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:04.280]   Could be anything, but I wouldn't mind using those accounts.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.160]   I just don't want to prioritize those accounts and not have any excess money.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.220]   So I think you need 10 grand in your savings account, and then you need to be increasing
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:16.240]   that number while you're also increasing the other accounts.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.880]   I know that's a wishy-washy answer.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:23.880]   I just want to be responsible with my language and drive home the point of saying $100,000
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.240]   should be a goal and that that money should be available to you, not locked away in your
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:32.880]   home equity, not locked away in your retirement accounts.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.600]   That's what I believe, but there's a prudent path to get there.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.120]   I don't think you should have $100,000 in cash and a bunch of debt.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   Pay off the debt, but move towards having some liquid money.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.160]   And then you do need to think about where to store it safely.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.640]   So where to store it?
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.980]   Retirement accounts are fine.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.200]   Savings accounts are fine.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.760]   Some amount of it in physical currency is fine as long as it's protected.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.840]   I don't mind life insurance cash values being part of that.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.160]   I don't mind even some conservative investments, but I just want to make sure that a lot of
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.640]   it is cash and that you reach the point where in your mind you say, "I can do anything that
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.800]   I want to do.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.100]   I have the ability to do that."
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.640]   Then go back to your life from a place of financial independence, from a place of financial
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.840]   abundance and look at how you're living, where you're living, what you're doing, etc. and
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.640]   say, "Since I'm rich now, is there anything that now that I'm rich?
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.800]   I would do differently if I were doing this over again."
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.280]   And then start adjusting to that.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.480]   Don't ratch up your expenses necessarily.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.340]   That can be dangerous.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.400]   If you are rich, you got $100,000 because you made frugal housing decisions and you
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.520]   bought a reasonable house in a nice neighborhood, but then all of a sudden you go and you buy
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   an extravagant house, well very quickly you're not going to be rich anymore.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.480]   You're just going to have a big extravagant house.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.640]   To be thoughtful, but approach your life from that perspective of confidence.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.480]   That's what savings gets you.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:11.240]   The ability to be free.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:17.320]   When I think of freedom, I'm not looking for the ability to not have to work.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.540]   Someday, yeah, and I'll tell you what it's really like when I get there.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.400]   Maybe I just don't know what it's like.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:29.960]   But I value very highly things like freedom of time, freedom of association, freedom of
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.600]   choice.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.200]   Those are some things that really make a big difference to me.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   And I found that they can be achieved with a lot less than a few million bucks.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.940]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.480]   As we go, I want to ask you, if you've enjoyed today's content, do me two favors.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.720]   Number one, tell a friend about the show.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.800]   Share with them an episode that you have enjoyed and tell a friend about it.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.700]   One of the things that I'd really like to do is I'd really like to be able to reach
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.700]   more people.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.960]   And the number one way that people find podcasts, and well they find them through searching,
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.720]   but one of the most effective ways is they have a recommendation from a friend.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720]   And so tell a friend about the show.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.560]   And then number two, if you would, it would be very helpful to me if you take a moment
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.360]   and just review the show on whatever platform you're using.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.600]   If you're using an Apple device or iTunes, review the show on iTunes.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.280]   If you're using an Android device, review the show on Google, whatever you're listening
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   to.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.000]   Just whatever the app is that you use to listen to the show, take a quick moment and look
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.080]   to see if it's got a way to rate it.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:39.480]   If you're on Spotify, just give me a quick five star or whatever you can.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.880]   And if there's a way to put in a sentence or two, that's so helpful.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.960]   Just the ratings and the sentences make a big, big difference.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.440]   Don't think that it needs to be very long.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.760]   Of course, you're welcome to write as many paragraphs as you like, but just one sentence
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.200]   is super great.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.880]   At this point in the growth of Radical Personal Finance, it's a fairly large show.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.680]   And the most impactful thing to demonstrate that to new listeners is simply the number
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   of reviews.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.960]   That's why I say that one or two sentences is fine.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.480]   I welcome, of course, multi-paragraph reviews.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   That's great.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.560]   New listeners do find those.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.560]   But at this point in time, a lot of those do get buried.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.960]   And so just one sentence.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.360]   So that would mean so much to me and be so helpful.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.520]   If you would just take a moment right as you do this, the next traffic light or pull over
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.820]   right when you get to the office or just take out your phone and whatever you're listening
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.980]   to me on.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:33.440]   Take a moment, look to see if there's a way to rate and review it and do it there.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.320]   If not, if you have an iTunes account, that's the big daddy of podcasts still.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.320]   So review me on iTunes.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.880]   That'd be so helpful.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.880]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.360]   Thank you for telling a friend about the show.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.600]   And I'll be back with you very soon for ring five, six and seven.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:55.160]   We're going to talk about increasing freedom with rings five, six and seven.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   The LA Kings holiday pack is back.
