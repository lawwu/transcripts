[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.800]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.920]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   And before we get started, I just want to give a shout out to a listener named Jeff.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.040]   He emailed me to share that he reached out to the manager of his hotel that he was
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   about to stay at, just like we talked about in episode one.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.800]   And when he checked in, he got upgraded to an executive suite on the top floor of
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.200]   the hotel. It makes me so happy to hear stories like that.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.040]   So if you're putting these hacks to good use, please let me know so I can share it
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.720]   with everyone else. So today's episode is all about money hacks.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.560]   And I'm joined by Lisa Rowan, who's a staff writer in consumer finance at
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   Forbes. She was previously a staff writer at Lifehacker and before that at the
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.400]   Penny Hoarder. She runs a top fashion podcast called Pop Fashion.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.120]   But more relevant to our conversation is that she's the author of Money Hacks, a
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.200]   new book that shares over 275 ways to decrease your spending, increase your
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.160]   savings and make your money work for you.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.920]   I couldn't be more excited to talk with someone as passionate about money hacks
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.040]   as I am. But before we jump in, I'm obliged to let you know.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.440]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.560]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.440]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.640]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.600]   investment decisions.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.360]   Lisa, thank you for being here.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.400]   I am excited.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   Oh, my gosh, thank you so much for having me, Chris.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.600]   It is always a thrill to talk to someone else who has hacks in their business name
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   because it means I know I'm in the right place.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.160]   Of course, I got your book and my wife was like, should you just give up?
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.400]   Someone else already did this.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   No, keep doing it.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.320]   We need more.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.440]   I only have 275 in this book.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.640]   There is room for plenty more.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.200]   I was actually surprised at the end.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.880]   There's 280.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600]   Did you not want to say did you not want to say 280 hacks?
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.720]   Doesn't really look good on the cover.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.280]   And do you know them all by number?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.160]   Absolutely not.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.960]   I was like, I thought it'd be great.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.760]   I just run through and I'd be like, Lisa, talk about number 135 and we just see
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.360]   what happens.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.760]   There was a time when I did when I was going through the process of writing this
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.320]   book and editing this book where I could rattle off like what number a certain
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.120]   hack was. But it's been a couple of months since the book came out and all of
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.640]   that information is no longer essential and it's just dripped out of my brain.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.920]   And I've just let it go.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.440]   I have to be OK with it leaving my brain.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.200]   I think that's fair. And how did you get so obsessed with money hacks yourself?
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.520]   This is something I sort of fell into and not to say that I my life has not all
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.680]   been serendipity. Right.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.080]   But it was by accident that I got into writing about money because I used to be a
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.400]   freelance writer and I was taking basically any subject that came along.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.720]   And the one thing that kept coming up over and over again happened to be small
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.920]   business for a couple of years because I owned a very small clothing store back in
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   Washington, D.C.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.280]   And so I was always thinking about small business or running one.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.800]   And I kept writing about business, small businesses, small business finances,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.920]   surviving as a small business person. And that ended up flowing over to personal
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.480]   finance when one of the content marketing companies that I was writing for picked up
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.640]   the penny hoarder as a client.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.960]   This was before Penny Hoarder had a staff of several dozen people.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.520]   They had one guy and a couple of freelancers who were writing content about all
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.640]   these weird ways to make and save money.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.960]   And I was like, sure, I love to get paid for writing.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.160]   I will pick up some personal finance concepts to be able to get paid to write.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.600]   Like, I'm game, sure.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.360]   And I am not someone who's good at math.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.760]   I barely, barely spelled my name right on the math portion of my SAT.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.880]   And so I never thought that I could really do personal finance because I just can't
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.440]   do math. But I always thought, well, oh, I can teach people about it.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.040]   As long as I'm not doing the math portion of the class, I can teach people about
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   it. So I started writing for the penny hoarder eventually so much that I ended up
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.560]   being a full-time writer with them.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.840]   And that really was just like doing a cannonball into the personal finance world,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.320]   just learning constantly, picking up tips, learning the to-don'ts that a lot of the
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.640]   time we don't speak about because there's so much embarrassment and shame around
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.120]   talking about money sometimes.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.960]   And at the same time that I was starting to write more and more and more about
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.640]   personal finance, I was also realizing that people maybe could learn from all of the
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.960]   money mistakes I had made in my life.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.880]   So I was probably, I was like 28 when I first really started writing about personal
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.160]   finance. And I was in a whole lot of debt.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.600]   I had made a lot of mistakes.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.560]   I had had a business that had opened and closed with a bunch of debt.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.600]   And so I really felt like, OK, if I'm honest with people that, you know, I am not a
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   mathematician, I am not, you know, a financial advisor, but I can pick up these
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.880]   concepts and better my financial life.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   Like you can, too.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.920]   Anyone can do it.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.840]   And so I just like sort of got caught in that wave.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.600]   And just even though I've been doing this since 2013, 2014, I still feel like I learn
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.480]   something new every day.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.040]   Wow. All right.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.640]   I similarly, I mean, I guess not similarly.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.680]   I was the opposite.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.720]   I was the do great on your math portion and like fail.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.920]   Like the only reason I had a good SAT score was because I did well on math.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.960]   The writing section was mine.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.040]   We must have like opposite sections of our brain that are like the strong ones, like
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.040]   put us together and we could conquer the world.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.400]   I mean, that's I mean, that's the plan.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.560]   That's that's this episode is let's conquer the world, at least at least from from
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.200]   money hacks perspective right now.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.800]   And we'll see where we can take it from there.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.520]   So, you know, when I read through this book, I found some hacks that I was like, of
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.240]   course, I tell people about this all the time.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.920]   I found a lot of hacks that I was like, I didn't know that and put them to use.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.640]   I thought maybe a good way to run through this, because we're not going to sit here
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.160]   and read 280 hacks as much as I think that could be interesting.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.360]   If you guys want 280 hacks, buy the book and then you can read all 280 hacks.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.440]   He's already doing it right.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.480]   He's already selling the book.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.120]   Good job. Yeah.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.000]   I mean, that's the you know, there are some great hacks.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.640]   So but I'd love to hear some of your favorites in kind of the sections.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.400]   And then I have some thoughts and favorites and other hacks that kind of
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.480]   complement maybe for edition number two.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.920]   And we can just go from there.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.760]   OK, so you kick this book off talking about curbing mindless spending, something
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.520]   that I think covid over the last year has made harder because we're just all
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.640]   sitting at home. I'm very excited to have more time outside to stop.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.880]   Well, I guess stop spending money online and start spending money in the real
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.320]   world. What are what are some of the hacks here that you think are the most
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.640]   exciting to talk about right now?
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.040]   Oh, gosh. And like I if you want to talk about impulse spending during the
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.000]   pandemic, like just there's just like a target right on my face.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.800]   It's like she she is the one who had the delivery guys at her home every day.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.360]   But one of the things that I like to think about when it comes to impulse
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.480]   spending is to think about the long term and the short term at the same time.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   So I have a tip. It's hack number forty four in case you want to like open your
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.080]   muscles to, you know, page forty nine and it's called pay yourself to splurge.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.760]   And what I like to think about is if I am thinking about spending money that
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.080]   maybe I wasn't planning to, maybe I'm browsing in a store, I'm just like
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.200]   cruising around online because I clicked on a sale advertisement.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.120]   I can think about what's in my cart, what the total is and say to myself, well,
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.640]   can I put the same amount of money in savings right now?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.080]   And if I'm going to buy this stuff, will I put the same amount of money in
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.880]   savings? So like I spent forty four dollars at Ulta the other day online.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.800]   The box is sitting next to my desk full of stuff to put on my skin.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.960]   I love it. But what I should do that I haven't done yet is put forty four
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.240]   dollars in my savings account.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.440]   And it helps me now because I've got sunscreen on my face.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.200]   It helps me later because I've got just a little bit more that's sitting in my
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.960]   savings account should I need it later.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.200]   And so I don't have to worry as much about splurging because I know that I'm
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.560]   covered on both sides. Right.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.200]   I can satisfy the now I can satisfy the later.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:04.320]   I will give the caveat here that it does not work for every every amount.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.080]   If you're thinking about splurging on, say, a new Corvette, you may not have
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.160]   the cash for that and the same amount of cash to put into savings.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.400]   But maybe then it is time for a larger reality check.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.600]   Maybe that is not going to be an impulse buy or a splurge.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.760]   Maybe you should plan ahead to buy the beautiful Corvette.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.720]   I think if you're buying a Corvette and you're worried about your savings,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.920]   there's there's definitely a bigger problem.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.960]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.760]   But if you're thinking about, oh, should I stop on my way home from work and pick
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   up some French fries because I really have a French fry craving like, OK,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.200]   that's going to cost you maybe five bucks.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.840]   Can you also transfer five dollars in your savings while you're sitting in the
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.520]   drive through line? All the better if you can and if you actually do it.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.160]   So I think if you can pay yourself to splurge, it's sort of builds up a defense
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.200]   to anyone who says to you, like, oh, that impulse buy was a waste of money.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   And you're like, whatever.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.640]   I handled my business and I'm handling my later business.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.720]   I like that. It reminds me of hack 18, which was saving 100 percent,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.760]   which is, you know, you see this thing and you're like, this is 40 percent off.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.600]   That's a good deal. I should get it.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.080]   How do I make sure that I save for the future while I do it?
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.280]   Why don't you just realize that if you don't buy it, you get to save 100 percent?
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.560]   And it seems so ridiculous.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.240]   But I see myself being one of those people that see something on sale and thinks,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.800]   well, I got to get it because it's a good deal.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.960]   And then now I just start telling myself and my wife reminds me that if you don't
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.400]   buy it, you get 100 percent off.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.000]   And I'm like, that's an even better deal.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.520]   Yes. And it's one of those things where you really have to trick your brain and
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.760]   just realize that like you're you have like a lizard brain that just wants stuff
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.320]   and wants and just so longs to exchange money for things.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.040]   And you have to rewire your brain to not do that.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   I'm a sucker for deals and and I've been using this to rewire my lizard brain.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.720]   What what else on spending?
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.000]   Since I just mentioned that I was shopping online recently, I'll bring up hack 14,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.680]   which is don't fall for the free shipping trap, because anyone look, any of us who
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.240]   might be elder millennials who grew up like learning the Internet as it was
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.880]   developed, you know, that as online shopping got more and more popular,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.080]   these retailers were like, please come shop with us.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.240]   We will give you free shipping.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.200]   And then they were like, we'll give you free shipping if you spend twenty five
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.240]   dollars. And then a couple of years later, they're like, we'll give you free
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.880]   shipping if you spend one hundred seventy five dollars.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.560]   And all of a sudden to get free shipping, you feel like you have to spend like way
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   more than you plan for.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.960]   Maybe you went online to buy a specific type of socks and now like you're in the
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.160]   whole one hundred bucks.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.320]   You're buying all these accessories that you don't need and you're like, wait, I
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   just came here for socks.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.720]   So if you've ever started browsing online and you start looking for something to
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.200]   add to your cart so that you get the free shipping, you need to stop and look at
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.920]   what's in your cart and say, am I willing to pay seven dollars and ninety five
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.120]   cents to have the ship to me?
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.720]   Because if you are, you should just pay for the shipping, because I guarantee you
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.200]   whatever you find to put in your cart is going to cost more than seven ninety five
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.920]   and all of a sudden you're going to spend more than you planned.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.880]   You're going to just overspend.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.040]   The box is going to come and you're going to be like, what the heck did I even like?
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.360]   Was this all even worth it?
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.120]   Like, why did I get this extra sock, one sock individually?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.000]   I don't know what you guys are shopping for online, but it's so easy to get out of
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.520]   control when you're shopping online.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.080]   And you know that there's like a little prize at the end if you get there, if you
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.160]   add up your cart to amount to that much.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.240]   But that can also just make you overspend and then you blow your budget and you're
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.800]   not happy.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.040]   So my version of this hack is let's say you're shopping online and you're trying
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.200]   to get shoes and you're like, oh, if I just spent another forty dollars, it's free
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.840]   shipping and there's free returns.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.680]   Don't add another pair of shoes.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.760]   You might like add a pair of shoes in size forty five.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.440]   Like add, you know, a triple XL like basketball jersey that you're never going to
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.880]   need because then you definitely will return it.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.000]   So don't add one more thing that you may or may not want to return.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.840]   Add something you will certainly return.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.440]   Obviously, it takes time to drive it to UPS or wherever you have to go to drop it
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.640]   off and time is worth money.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.080]   But, you know, if they offer free returns and you want free shipping and the amount
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.520]   you'll save is worth it, just get something else.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.600]   But ideally something you don't need.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.840]   Yeah, and before you do that, make sure even if they say they have free returns,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.600]   make sure that it's not going to be really complicated to actually do the return.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.120]   Like make sure you'll be able to print a return label at home or you'll be able to
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.280]   just drop it off at a place that's convenient for you.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.400]   Like say they use FedEx, but there's no FedEx office within like 30 miles of your
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.280]   house. That's not going to make sense for you.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.520]   It's just not worth it.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.840]   You have to you have to like think the process all the way through before you hit,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.400]   you know, purchase on the cart, which we get.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.880]   It takes some of the fun out of online shopping.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.680]   But if you're thinking smart while you're adding things to your cart, you might make
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.000]   a better financial decision than you would have expected for yourself.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.400]   And to wrap up spending, you know, in the last year, I think we've probably all
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.360]   added at least a few subscriptions to ourselves.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.720]   So, you know, talk about hack 20, which is all about stopping these free trials.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.320]   And then I think there's a hack right before it about subscriptions.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.720]   Y'all really I'm speaking to myself directly in this hack, but y'all really need to
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.360]   look at your billing statements each month and see all the stuff that you are paying
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.320]   for. Like why do we all have seven streaming memberships and why do they all cost
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.400]   $14.99? Like what?
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.200]   I thought we were supposed to be saving money on this.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.720]   My point is there comes a time when you realize that you're getting nickel and dimed
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.040]   in your budget because you're signed up for all these things that you may not be
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.760]   utilizing, whether it's a workout membership, either, you know, streaming or in
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.360]   person. If it's streaming music, streaming video, if it's like an online learning
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.120]   platform that you haven't used in three or five months, you know, there are all these
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.280]   things that just like languish and they just leech money out of your budget each month.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.960]   So it is worth going through and sort of doing a little audit on all your subscriptions
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.400]   and going through and saying, what day of the month does it bill me?
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.200]   How much does it cost and am I using this?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.520]   When is the last time I logged in?
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.200]   When's the last time I actually use this?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.120]   And if I haven't logged in recently, is there a legitimate reason?
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.840]   Maybe it's a seasonal thing and that's fine.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.760]   But if you can find two, three, four of those subscriptions that you don't need, you
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.160]   could be adding twenty, thirty, forty dollars back into your budget each month and you
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.560]   could be using that for things that make you happier or take the money from canceling
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:49.160]   your streaming workout program and then use it to like splurge on one or two group
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.480]   exercise classes each month.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.640]   Now that we're finally emerging from our pandemic cocoons, remember that you have
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.720]   options with your money.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.560]   You don't have to keep a subscription forever just because you signed up for it.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.520]   And, you know, canceling might take some calls to customer service, some emails back
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.240]   and forth. But it's worth it if it means you can get money back into your budget every
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.880]   month. Yeah, I recently signed up for something that had a 30-day trial.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.320]   I forgot to cancel it.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.720]   And then I had this bill just lingering and I was trying to figure out how to prevent
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.080]   this in the future. And now I've switched.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.240]   And anytime I sign up for a free trial on anything, I use Privacy.com.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.960]   And so at Privacy.com, you can go put in your bank information and they will give you a
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.680]   virtual card and you can create one for every different vendor and then you can
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   immediately turn it off.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.320]   So if you're thinking, I really want to watch this movie, it's on Showtime.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.240]   They have a seven-day free trial.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.000]   You sign up, you put in your privacy card number.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.560]   Then as soon as you've signed up, you go and cancel the card.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   You turn it off. Now, Showtime, instead of having to email them or call them or cancel
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.360]   your membership, they're going to cancel it for you because the card's not going to
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.880]   work. And so whenever I'm doing something where I want a subscription for a year and I
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.360]   can't cancel it, I'll just put in a privacy card number and then turn it off and know
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.480]   that there's no way that I'm going to get charged again in the future.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.880]   That's perfect. It is way more efficient, it's way hackier than my method, which is
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.920]   when I sign up for a free trial, I'll write a reminder to turn it off like three days
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.240]   before it actually ends in my paper planner, which is just like, I think that's just
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.480]   being organized. I don't think that's a hack, you know.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.840]   But does it always work?
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.000]   Because I always put a little calendar invite and then sometimes I just miss the
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.360]   calendar invite. And so I had to get I had to get a new system.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.280]   No, I will live and die by my planner.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   So sometimes I double up to I'll put it in my planner and I'll put a reminder on my
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.760]   phone. So I like I try to make it fail proof, although like, look, things happen.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.680]   And, you know, worst case scenario, like there have been times that I've emailed
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.080]   customer service and been like, look, I messed up.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.320]   Can I have my money back?
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.800]   And sometimes that works and it doesn't hurt to ask.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.440]   I do that. I'm like, oh, I meant to cancel this.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.120]   I'm really sorry. And most of the time I've been able to get money back and it's
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.840]   worked pretty well. Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.120]   It never hurts to ask.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.040]   So that's spending.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:18.160]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.840]   emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.760]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.840]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.040]   Thirty seven thousand, twenty five, one.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.440]   Thirty seven thousand.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.320]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.880]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial

[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.440]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.840]   good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.880]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.720]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.840]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.560]   two hundred and fifty year old tea trees rich in minerals, theraflavins and
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.600]   catechins. Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.400]   and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.560]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.400]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.760]   friendly. They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.320]   green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh, which helps
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.600]   kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.240]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.520]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.560]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.800]   other teas in the world.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.760]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.160]   free US shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.960]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.840]   The number of hacks that I wrote in this next chapter on being a savvy saver was
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.520]   so many that I feel like we could do a whole episode on this, but I want to hit
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.680]   on some of the top ones.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.760]   But first, what is your kind of one or two always want to make sure people know
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.600]   from this section?
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.640]   Okay, I want to make sure that you know about hack number 70, which is pay less
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.760]   for prescription drugs, which sounds like the most unsexy topic ever, but it's
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.040]   something that I actually got to put into practice a couple of weeks ago.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.520]   And I think in these changing times where like you might have insurance from your
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.360]   employer, you're doing stuff on the exchange, like it's confusing a lot of the
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.880]   time to figure out prescription drugs that you need and what you're going to pay out
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.640]   of pocket for them.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.120]   So this is something that really worked for me recently.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.720]   I was seeing a doctor and she told me she wanted me to take this particular drug,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.640]   but she warned me.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.720]   She said for this particular use, it's not covered by insurance.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.360]   And I was like, all right, well, like tell me how much it's really going to cost.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.640]   Like I can think about, you know, like what this is going to mean for me.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.640]   And she said, no, no, I've got a coupon.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.800]   And so she text messaged me a coupon from, I think it was a good RX coupon.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.680]   There are a couple of different options out there so that I would be able to get a 30
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.880]   day supply for $30, which to me is way better than a 30 day supply for $85.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.720]   So that was really meaningful to me that she was like thinking ahead of like, OK, I
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.160]   want my patients to be able to have this.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.840]   But like, here's she figured out the hack for me basically.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.200]   But it got even better when I called the pharmacy because I got that text message
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.800]   that was like, insurance rejected your, your prescription.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.840]   What do you want to do?
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.520]   And so I called them and I was like, hey, I know this isn't covered, but my doctor
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.360]   gave me a coupon and they said, oh, I think we have the same coupon.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.960]   Hold on. Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.080]   Thirty dollars for a 30 day supply.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.240]   I was like, look at these heroes working for me so that I don't spend too much money.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.400]   There are a lot of times when your doctor or your pharmacist will know of a way to
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.600]   save money on a drug.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.040]   So it's always useful to ask when you're sitting in the doctor's office, you know,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.360]   do you have any idea how much this will cost?
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.440]   Do you know if there are any ways I can save on this?
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.280]   No one's going to fault you for being cost conscious and worried about your health at
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.360]   the same time, you know?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.920]   No. But if you are not sure, you can check some of the apps.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.760]   The one I mentioned is good, our apps.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.200]   And so you can do some research online to find out prices at different pharmacies for
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.360]   the drug that you need.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.560]   So maybe you go a little bit out of your way to take it to a pharmacy that you don't
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.520]   usually use, but you could save a bunch of money.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.560]   So it's worth doing a little bit of research before you pick up a prescription.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.800]   Granted, if you are feeling really sick and just want to get home, like don't, this
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.920]   isn't going to matter. Like just get it filled, get whatever you need.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.560]   But if it's something where you don't need it, you know, that same day, it's worth
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.360]   taking 15, 20 minutes, maybe max, to find out how much you can expect to pay and if
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.240]   you can save anything.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.040]   Yeah, and I don't think this just applies to prescriptions.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:31.000]   I've had multiple situations where I asked a doctor, "Hey, if I'm not going to be
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.400]   able to get this done with insurance, is there a different price?"
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:39.320]   And one time I needed these like cortisone injection and they were like, "Well, if we
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.600]   send it to insurance, it's like $175.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.560]   But if you're paying out of pocket, we can do it for $30." And I was like, "$30?"
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.000]   So now I've gotten in the habit, especially if you're on a high deductible health
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   plan, to just ask, "Hey, what is this out of pocket if I can't cover it with my
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.160]   insurance plan?" And in all different areas, I've seen it work in dental.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.600]   I've seen it work with kind of regular doctor's treatments.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.280]   I know that some hospitals have a program for people going through IVF if you're
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:13.960]   like, "I can't afford all these drugs." So just ask doctors for coupons or discounts
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.680]   or special pricing and it can save you a lot of money.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:27.280]   Yeah, yeah. And it can be so anxiety-ridden to ask a medical professional about money
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.720]   stuff because you don't want to seem like you're afraid to spend money on yourself.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.440]   But if you just ask, "Tell me about the costs I can expect or tell me the difference
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.640]   between paying for this with insurance and paying for it out of pocket," just to open
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.360]   it up to a discussion, you'll be surprised what they're willing to tell you and how
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   they're willing to work with you to make sure that you can get what you need and
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.880]   also not exhaust your deductible on one visit.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.440]   Because let me tell you, that high deductible health plan is really great until
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.000]   you're like, "I'm sorry, it costs how much?"
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.080]   It's unbelievable.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.200]   You've got like a doctor's appointment can somehow be hundreds of dollars.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.960]   So, yeah, definitely worth asking.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.200]   And I know you talk a little bit about, I don't remember the hack number, but how
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.520]   everyone should be trying to search online for promo codes and coupons when you're
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.880]   checking out. There are so many sites out there.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.120]   Honey has a browser extension that will let you search for it.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.080]   The add on to that, that this made me think of because we were talking about getting
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.000]   coupons from doctors, is I've recently started just live chatting with the brand.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.960]   So if there's like a live chat at the bottom and I say, "Hey, I'm looking to check
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.880]   out. Is there a coupon?"
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.560]   They're not on commission.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.600]   If there's a coupon and they're going to get you to get you to the sale, they're
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.280]   going to be excited. And it doesn't always work.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.640]   But I've gotten coupons for things where after searching on the Internet, looking
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.080]   for promo codes, I can't find anything.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.840]   And then I just ask and they're like, "Oh, yeah, here's 10% off."
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.360]   Nice. I love that.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.480]   Yeah, because they're not there to be salespeople.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.320]   No, they just want to help you get checked out.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.240]   And I'm sure if they help you with your order and you check out, it looks good for
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.120]   their metrics. So they're definitely trying to just get the order done.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.520]   Okay. I want to do some quick hits here because we don't need to spend forever.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.560]   But these are things that I actually have never heard of or don't know how to take
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.040]   advantage of. So can you talk like rapid-fire repair cafes?
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.640]   Yes. Oh, repair cafes are a thing where you can take a thing you own that's broken
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.440]   and people will teach you how to fix it.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.520]   You get to use their tools.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.960]   Yes, it's totally free.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.680]   A lot of them happen at local libraries or local like different like artists
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.560]   workshops. And they will teach you how to fix something.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.880]   They will share their tools with you and they will send you home with newfound
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.400]   knowledge about how to fix your thing, whether it's like your blender or a bike.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.040]   And you can get more life out of that thing instead of tossing it and buying a new
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.800]   one. Yeah, this was awesome.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.480]   I didn't even know it existed.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.360]   You had another one on pawn shops.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.960]   I've everyone's seen pawn shops.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.280]   I've never even thought of how to use them.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.800]   How can you use a pawn shop to save money?
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Yeah, they're not all like you see on TV or like whatever like seedy thing you have
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.600]   in your mind. Pawn shops have all of those things that you want, but aren't really
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.360]   sure if you want to invest on something new, maybe like a piece of lawn equipment or
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.280]   an electronic item, something where you're not quite sure if you want to pay full
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.960]   price, but you don't really want to roll the dice at a thrift store on something that
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.080]   may be used or may not be in stock when you go to find it.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.800]   And the thing that I recommend is calling one before you go to see if they have that
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.160]   type of item you're looking for.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.000]   If you want a weed whacker, you don't want to show up and they never carry lawn
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.040]   equipment. So call them first.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.120]   Say, "Do you have this type of item?
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.920]   What's your price range for this?" And do a little bit of comparison shopping before
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.040]   you go. They're always willing to answer questions because they want to sell stuff.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.360]   And if they don't tell you about stuff, they're not going to sell it.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.040]   Now, what about the flip? If you need to sell something, do you sell it at a pawn shop
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.800]   or where do you sell things you no longer need?
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.400]   If you want cash today, maybe a pawn shop is the best option.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.240]   If you are willing to wait a couple of days, maybe do a Facebook marketplace, do a
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.040]   Nextdoor marketplace.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.840]   Craigslist even is still a good place.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.360]   Or if you have like a specialty item that might be something like on Poshmark or
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.760]   StockX or something like that.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.160]   But they can be a good place to sell items.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.080]   Again, it's worth making a call first to see if they're even buying that item.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.720]   So one other one.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.920]   What do you do when you get to the grocery store?
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.000]   Well, I immediately go to the baked goods because I want all of the pastries.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.840]   But what I really do is grab a cart and I start on the right side of the store and I
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.280]   work my way around to the left side and it ends up being counterclockwise.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.360]   And if you're thinking about this, you're like, Lisa, you're crazy.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.440]   But look, the next time you walk into your grocery store, the entrance is on the right
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.920]   side. They want you to go counterclockwise.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.760]   The reason is because more people are right handed.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.920]   They want you to steer the cart with your left hand and shop with your right hand.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.840]   Instead of trying to shop creatively and risk knocking over all the canned goods on
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.720]   someone, what you can really just do is go clockwise around the store.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.480]   Go in the same entrance as everyone.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.840]   Don't be crazy, but just just go backwards.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.760]   Start at the opposite section and work your way around and do it the other way.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:20.120]   You will. Scientists say you will spend two dollars less on every transaction if you go
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.920]   clockwise instead of counterclockwise.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.640]   Two dollars may not be worth it for you, but there may come a time when it is worth it
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.680]   to you. Yeah.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.840]   And this is every time, right?
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   Once you get used to walking around the grocery store clockwise, now that just becomes
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.880]   second nature. So, yeah, it's going to be annoying the first time.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.480]   And then you switch it back.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.760]   You know, just keep keep switching it up, because if you break your routine, you're not
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.120]   going to be mindlessly grabbing things.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.440]   And that's really what it comes down to.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.720]   I also used another hack of yours this morning, which was not getting a cart.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.000]   So I recently moved to a suburban town where carts fit in the aisles, unlike the ones in San
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.560]   Francisco where you have mini carts.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.320]   And I found, you know, you're just always putting stuff in the cart.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.920]   There's unlimited room in the cart.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.440]   So I was like, I'm going to grab a basket this time, because if you just walk around the
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.760]   grocery store in a basket, you're not going to buy that thing you don't need because you
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.120]   don't have room for it. I got in and out quick.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.880]   I spent half of what I normally do at the grocery store.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.360]   And so that was a great hack.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.240]   I did this the other day at the hardware store where I really thought that I could get
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.360]   everything I needed and just hold it in my arms.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.960]   And then I got to the register and while she was ringing up my items, I was like, excuse
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.640]   me, I'm going to go get a cart so I can get all these things out of the store now.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.000]   And I kind of failed at my own hack.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.080]   This is me trying to save 10 cents ridiculously at the grocery store.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.160]   I'm like, do you need a bag?
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.920]   And I'm like, no, I can balance my eggs on top of my flour and some vegetables and I'll
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.200]   put them in my jacket pocket because I know I don't want to spend an extra 10 cents for
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:53.240]   a bag. I've literally filled pockets with groceries to save 10 cents, which is an
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.920]   embarrassing thing that I should not be doing.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:00.720]   The one other thing that I didn't see in the book that has been a fun one, especially
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.080]   watching what happens when I told my parents about it.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.480]   Depending on the city you live in, you may have multiple different energy plans.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.600]   And so I know in San Francisco, PG&E is our gas and electric provider.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.040]   And on their website, you can choose different energy plans.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.720]   You can say, I want the plan that has a tiered usage.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.880]   As you use more, it gets more expensive.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.200]   You can use the plan that's really expensive from like 3 p.m.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.000]   to 10 p.m.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.520]   And they're even third parties.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.960]   So there's this website called Ohm Connect, and you can create an account and link it
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.480]   to your energy plan.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.120]   And they have some relationships such that they'll send you times where if you limit
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.000]   your usage of energy, they'll send you money.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.960]   And so it's so funny.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.480]   I'm at my parents' house and they're like, everybody, everybody, it's 5 o'clock.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.040]   We have to turn all the lights off, unplug the fridge, unplug this.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.000]   And I'm like, our daughter is sleeping.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.800]   I'm like, can we leave the sound machine on?
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.240]   And they're like, oh, I guess you can leave the sound machine on this time.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.880]   But like everything else has to be off.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.760]   And we're like all sitting in the dark for one hour.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.040]   And at the end of the time, I'm like, what did we save?
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.480]   And she's like, probably seven dollars.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.440]   And I'm like, well, maybe on the one family getaway where we come visit you, we could
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.280]   just not worry about the seven dollars.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:16.000]   Right. But a lot of times they're not even home or they're going to go sit on the patio
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.640]   and enjoy a glass of wine on the patio.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.320]   And you could just turn the power off in the house.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.120]   You can turn your fridge off.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.560]   And so I think they've probably saved a few hundred dollars in the last year doing this.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.520]   And they're loving it.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:36.120]   That is amazing. And it taps into like our our sense of like how much we love games.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.760]   Right. Like we always want to win and we always want to win the game.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.880]   And so when they're like, oh, turn everything off, we're about to win.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.920]   We're about to save some money.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.160]   And then they look at their granddaughter and they're like, how much do we love her?
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.920]   She can stay, but we still want to win the game.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.480]   We did this in San Francisco before we got an electric car, which ruins the whole thing
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.760]   because you can't be on the electric car plan and the game plan.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.720]   So unless you have an electric car, get on the game plan and make saving money fun at
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.640]   home in the dark.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.000]   And maybe if you work from home full time, maybe this doesn't work right for you because
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.640]   you'll be like, oh, I can't get on that conference call.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.480]   I must turn off my computer now and unplug it.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.320]   Goodbye. I'm trying to imagine that.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.440]   We're called Yeah. Four o'clock doesn't work.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.760]   That's the hour I have to have my electricity off.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.000]   They're like, where do you live? And you're like, California.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.400]   Yeah, I live in the city.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.800]   I just get paid seven dollars.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.480]   So your mileage may vary on that one, but I do want to check it out.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.960]   Yeah. Ohm Connect.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.040]   I don't know if it works in every city, but it is pretty cool.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.840]   So we're spending a lot of time on spending and savings, which I think is really like
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.520]   the bulk of a lot of the hacks that I talk about with people.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.160]   But there's some really good ones in the next section.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.680]   So I don't want to miss out in getting debt free, which I know is something that you talk
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.080]   a lot about personally in the book.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:56.160]   There are a few things in here that I think you have to hit on because I was blown away
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.400]   asking a landlord for rent.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.480]   I've never even heard of this.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.920]   And I know a lot of people start out with no credit.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.480]   Can you talk about how to do that?
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.880]   Yeah, your rent is typically something that's not reported to the credit bureaus who
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.560]   calculate your credit score.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:16.280]   So usually your credit score is made up of your debts and maybe you don't have any debts,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.920]   but you're just starting to build your financial, you know, your financial foundation.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.240]   You don't have any credit accounts yet.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.640]   And like, how do you show that you're trustworthy with money?
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.960]   Right. You can actually ask your landlord to report your rent to these different
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.600]   agencies, and a lot of them work as a pass through for your rent.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.360]   So they sort of confirm that, like, OK, this person has paid their rent and they will
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.320]   report for you to the credit bureaus that you are paying your rent on time.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:48.720]   And by having this account with this company that will monitor your rent payments, they
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.760]   will report it to the credit bureaus and then it gets added to your credit score.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:57.800]   And so you can really start building your credit profile by doing the thing that you
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.160]   already do every month, which is pay your rent.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.600]   You're going to do that no matter what, in most cases.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.280]   Right. So if you can have it add to that picture of your financial health, all the better
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.000]   for it. The only caveat here is that if you feel like you might be in, you know, sort
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.160]   of a chancy housing situation, you know, for a couple of months or there might have
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.920]   been a couple of months where you're late by a couple of days on rent, this may not
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.840]   be the best thing for you because, you know, the negative marks also show.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.200]   So you want to make sure that you have a really healthy history at paying this very
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.560]   important bill before you add the extra step of requesting to have it added to your
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.160]   credit report. Yeah.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.920]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and Trade Coffee is a great
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.320]   addition to your new year routine, and I am so excited to be partnering with them today.

[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.160]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.760]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.640]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.880]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.760]   Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.280]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.120]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit

[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.920]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:52.120]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.000]   cooking at home?
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.480]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.880]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.120]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.680]   from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.720]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.440]   microwave.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.800]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.240]   the process so much.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.240]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.760]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.480]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly recommend
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.040]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.440]   It is so good.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.560]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year,
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.040]   you have to check it out.

[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.240]   And then a thing that I've been doing for a while, and it makes me so sad when I hear
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.360]   people not know about it, was your Hack 107.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.200]   So if you're asking your landlord to report your rent, often that's to help boost your
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.680]   credit. But if you don't know what your credit is, a lot of people I know use Credit
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.240]   Karma and they go get a credit score, but that's not the same credit score that gets
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.680]   pulled when you buy a car or when you buy a house.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.720]   They're pulling your FICO score, and it turns out that you can get your FICO score for
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.320]   free if you have a bank account at a lot of institutions.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.360]   And so Hack 107, can you share a little more?
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.480]   Yeah. Always look for opportunities to get your free FICO score.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.160]   It's something where if you're paying out of pocket, it costs maybe $30 to access your
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.800]   score in this current date and time.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.680]   Right. It's something that can change a lot.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.960]   So you can look it up once, but that's not going to guarantee that it's not going to
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.720]   change tomorrow. Right.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.440]   But the services like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame, they show your Vantage score, which
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.960]   is good. It helps you get a picture of your financial health, but it is not the one that
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.560]   lenders use, like Chris said.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.840]   So I'll give you an example from my own life.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.360]   I have accounts with Bank of America.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.600]   I have a MasterCard credit card.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.320]   I have a Visa credit card.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.760]   And all three of those give me the opportunity when I log into my online account to
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.440]   click and look at my FICO score today based on my activity that they've pulled.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.000]   And it's a service that they provide to their customers, sort of like an added benefit.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.520]   So I can, you know, while I'm doing my normal checks of my finances and my usual
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.560]   accounts, I can check in on that FICO score and know that that's the one that if I
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.720]   wanted to buy a car today or if I wanted to apply for a mortgage today, you know, I
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.520]   would have a really good idea of what my quote unquote "official" credit score is
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.200]   because the FICO one is used so much more by lenders.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.240]   And remember, it's free. Do not pay for your credit score.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.280]   Just know where to look.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   And you're probably already using an account that provides this service.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.560]   Yeah, I got mine for years from Wells Fargo for free.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.280]   So there's so many companies that offer this.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.920]   OK, there's one hack in this section.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:24.960]   I don't know why it's in this section, but hack 125 about getting your missing money.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.160]   Oh, my gosh, this is my favorite of all time.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.920]   So I'm going to start backwards.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.200]   I'm going to tell you why claiming you're missing money is in the section about
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   paying off debt, because in theory, if you find money, if you get a windfall, you can
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.880]   put it towards your debt and pay it off faster.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.480]   That is the ideal situation when you have any sort of spare cash.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.120]   That's why it ended up in this chapter.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.280]   But the more fun part is finding the money.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.760]   If you like treasure hunts, if you like anything related to like the thrill of the
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.360]   hunt, this is the one for you.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.480]   Every state has a repository where money goes when they can't get it to you.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.080]   It might be companies that you made a deposit with and they couldn't get it back to
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.040]   you, like a utility deposit or a last paycheck from an employer.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:17.520]   Or even I had a refund from CVS, from the CVS pharmacy, that they couldn't get back
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.560]   to me in some way. They'd mailed a check to an address that I wasn't at anymore.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.040]   And years later, I found it in Washington, D.C.'s unclaimed money fund, my refunds
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.720]   from CVS. So all this money is there.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:37.400]   It is a matter of you figuring out whether you're owed any.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.720]   So it's up to you to look yourself up in your state directory or any state you may
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   have previously lived in.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.440]   Don't forget those. And then if your name pops up, you might not know how much you're
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.400]   getting, but it'll show you who owes you money and you can withdraw that.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.720]   You have to verify your identity by taking a couple of steps, but you'll get a check
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:02.040]   in the mail or a PayPal deposit in some cases for this money that just could never make
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.240]   its way to you that you're owed.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.640]   So my recent example is that I got refunds from CVS.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.240]   I got like eleven dollars total.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.400]   It wasn't very exciting.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.840]   But I have a friend who told her parents about this and they went on New York State's
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:22.120]   program and found some like old stocks that her dad's workplace, you know, had given
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.440]   him or he'd gotten through the retirement plan there.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.760]   And for some reason they got lost in the system or whatnot.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.720]   But they were worth thirty five hundred dollars.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.800]   And so when he got the check for thirty five hundred dollars, they were able to plan a
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.320]   trip to Italy, you know, with this like basis of like this money that they had had no
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:47.120]   idea existed. So like I said before, if you find this money, you could you could take
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.400]   thirty five hundred dollars and put it in your on your debt and pay it off that much
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.520]   faster or go to Italy.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.560]   It's up to you. This is goes back to the game idea.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.800]   Like this feels like a game.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.720]   Like when I go on these websites, I'm like I'm on a treasure hunt.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.280]   I feel like there is money to find and I want it.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:09.200]   If it's ten dollars, the satisfaction of getting ten dollars that someone owes me that
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.640]   they never gave me is probably worth even more than ten dollars.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.200]   But for us, we just found a fifty dollar Delta gift card.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.760]   They were like, you had a gift card.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.360]   You never used it. Do you still want it?
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.840]   We're like, yeah, we want that gift card.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.480]   We're going to go somewhere now.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.960]   We're not going to go anywhere for fifty dollars, maybe like, but it'll maybe make a
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.880]   flight a little cheaper.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.200]   Yeah, and those little amounts can add up.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.240]   I had a friend recently who was looking herself up after my eleven dollar windfall and
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.680]   she's like, oh, it's like, you know, 50 bucks.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.160]   But, you know, it's under my maiden name.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   And like to have that documentation, yada yada, I got married years ago.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.040]   I was like, girl, get your money.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.200]   Like, why is it sitting there in the District of Columbia's bank account?
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.520]   Get your money.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.360]   Use it on snacks.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.280]   Like, think clearly here.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.040]   So I was trying to convince her to like take the 20 minutes to pull out her marriage
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.920]   license and whatnot and and do it because I think it's worth it.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.400]   Yeah. And it's fun.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.880]   I there's nothing that makes you feel better than getting money that's yours, that
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.200]   someone else has, at least for me.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.320]   Finding money that I didn't have to work for is is fantastic.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.000]   But it's the best feeling.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   There's this whole section that that's about making more money.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.120]   Some of it you do have to work for some of it you don't.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.760]   When someone comes to you and says, look, I've saved everything I can.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   I've spent I've lowered my spending.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.840]   I've increased my savings.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.320]   And I just want more money.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.200]   I have some time.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.320]   Maybe I don't. How can I just get more money?
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.720]   I feel like that's a common thing people want.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.840]   How do you help people get more money?
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.440]   You've got to figure out how to make it.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.360]   And generally you have two options.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.760]   One is to figure out how to make more money at your current job or your day job or
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   your what might be your primary job.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:58.440]   Your other option is to start working, doing something different, maybe a side
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.360]   hustle, maybe something that you add on to your primary work.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.840]   So it's sort of a, you know, six of one, half a dozen of the other situation,
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.760]   because, you know, a lot of people, it's maybe you're capped out in your current
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.440]   role, so you're going to have to add somewhere else.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.480]   Or maybe you don't have time to take on a side hustle.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.200]   So you really need to look to your current job.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   Right. But you have to figure out where you can find that money.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.640]   And let me tell you, if you haven't updated your resume in a while or your
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.120]   portfolio in a while, like here's your reminder to keep it updated because you
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.000]   never know when an opportunity will arise.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.600]   And it's funny how annual review time will sneak up on you at work and suddenly
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.960]   you're thinking back and you're saying, oh, what did I do all year?
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.920]   What were my accomplishments?
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:44.160]   What have I done? What are my reasons that someone should pay me more money for
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.480]   the good work I'm doing?
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.400]   So you have to be ready to seize those opportunities, whether it's because you
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.480]   can go for a promotion, you know, annual reviews are coming up and you'll be able
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.520]   to ask for a raise or if, you know, maybe you're just thinking about your skills
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.560]   and how you might be able to add income through a side hustle.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.760]   It's good to be thinking about those accomplishments, those skills, what's on
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   your resume, what's on your LinkedIn so that you can think smart about how to
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.560]   bring in more money.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   Yeah. And on the side hustle category, there are a bunch in here and I'm curious
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.840]   how many of them you know about or have done.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:22.120]   So I'm going to start with have you actually put yourself up for rent as a
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.600]   friend? I have never signed up for rentafriend.com.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.240]   It is a real website.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.360]   It is not as salacious as it might sound.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:38.960]   It is really like a rated G place to find people to hang out with for, you know,
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.360]   maybe you are making friends in a city or yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.280]   You pay them for the the honor of spending time together.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.040]   I have never done that, but I would be willing, would I be willing to do it?
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.840]   Let's be real here. I'm kind of an introvert.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.480]   Maybe I wouldn't be willing to do that.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.160]   Maybe I'm just offering it for the right person out there who's listening or
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:00.600]   reading.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.520]   OK, what are some on here that you have done to make a little extra money on the
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.600]   side? Wait, so have you sold your junk mail?
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.440]   I have not sold my junk mail, but you could sell your junk mail.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.800]   There's actually a program run by a thing called SBK Center.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.760]   It's a market research company, and they want to know what kind of junk mail
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.240]   you're getting. So you bundle up all of your junk mail.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.640]   I think like every month you send it to them.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   They give you points.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.240]   Eventually you get enough points to get like a prepaid gift card.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:35.000]   And it's like you just got paid to bring in your mail every day.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.880]   Yeah, which I'm already doing.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.560]   Right. I'm already doing.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.120]   I'm already I'm just throwing it in recycling all the time.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.600]   So if someone wants to pay me and if they give you a prepaid envelope and I
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.560]   can just put it back in the mailbox, I'm going to start doing that.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.920]   One side hustle that I'm not allowed to do because of my profession, but I think
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.880]   is very much worth your time in a lot of cases, is to participate in focus groups.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:05.960]   You can get paid for your opinion on everything from snack foods to shampoo to
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.800]   any other product under the sun.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:14.680]   Companies are always looking for people to test ideas on when they have products
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.720]   in development or they're thinking about new flavors or new colors, that sort of
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.120]   thing. So you, as I say in the book, you probably can't make a living off of
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.680]   participating in focus groups because you're not going to be a match for all of
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:29.040]   them. Some of them will take place at times of day that may not be convenient
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.200]   for you, but you could make up to $200 to participate in a single focus group
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.520]   session. And this is just to provide your opinion.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.640]   This is not like like medical test groups where you might be taking like a
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.960]   placebo for several months and be getting paid.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.000]   This is just to share your opinion on something or maybe taste some food.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.440]   So it's pretty low stakes.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   There are there are a lot of companies out there who do this.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.040]   The if you Google focus groups near you or near your city, just keep in mind that
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.960]   legitimate ones will never charge you a fee to sign up or to access
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:09.160]   opportunities. But you can, you know, make a notable side income just by sharing
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.400]   your time and your opinions.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.680]   Yeah, and it doesn't have to be an in-person focus group.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.720]   I know at Wealthfront, I build a lot of products and we do both user testing and
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.560]   idea testing on platforms like D-Scout is one that you can sign up and get
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.680]   selected to go on these, they call them missions.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.640]   And a company will show you an app and you have to, you know, try to use it out
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.200]   and give feedback on how it's working.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.480]   User testing is one that we've used.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.040]   So you could do this from home or you could do this on online products.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.040]   And, you know, I get a ton of value from talking to people about how they feel
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.240]   about our products and we pay for that.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.200]   Yeah, yeah, you no matter how much thought or effort you put into something
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.880]   you're working on at your company, you don't really know how good it is until
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.840]   you put it in front of real people and have them like try to break it, right, or
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.240]   tell you how they really feel about it.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:06.400]   And so it's really important for people to be willing to do these kinds of tasks.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.320]   And if there's a monetary reward for you, like all the better for it.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:10.980]   Okay.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.840]   Let's combine the last two sections, planning for the future and protecting
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.640]   your money and do a fast round greatest hits.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.200]   What are your favorites here?
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.380]   Okay.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.400]   One of my favorites is don't watch the stock market.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:30.320]   It is really tempting, but if you're someone who has really, really simple
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:35.440]   investments, maybe you have things in index funds, if you're doing that kind
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.800]   of thing, you do not need to be looking at how Tesla did yesterday.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.400]   Okay.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.080]   Like that is not something that is going to help your financial goals.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.080]   Don't worry about it.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.720]   If people are freaking out about the stock market, don't worry about it.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.800]   Uh, I think Chris would tell you that like the, the return tends to be like.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.320]   7% a year on average.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.640]   So I would never make any promises about what the return would be, but
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:04.040]   historically you could probably say historically the stock market tends to
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.080]   grow over the longterm, if you are investing for the longterm, stop looking
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.600]   at the stock market, it's going to stress you out.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.880]   That's just a tip from me to you.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.280]   It's in the book too, but it's also from me to you.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.720]   Just, just another quick tip that like came up in my life recently.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.920]   Don't click on text messages that say they're from your bank.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.800]   Those are not real.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.480]   Those are a good way to lose money and have your identity stolen.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.200]   And then that's going to open up a whole financial can of worms for you.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.400]   There's a whole bunch of friends and I recently got text messages, um, that
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.680]   said they had some like, like do this to, you know, like confirm your account or
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.880]   whatever, and we realized pretty quickly that somebody was trying to scam us
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.360]   into giving away our information.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:52.920]   So if your bank, your credit card, your mortgage, if any financial account sends
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:57.440]   you a text message and they want you to do something or click on something, don't
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.040]   do it because financial institutions don't do that.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.600]   They don't contact you that way.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.960]   So just like keep your guard up when you're flipping around in your phone and
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.680]   you're getting text messages in, do not let your guard down and start clicking on
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.280]   things because you want to be efficient and you want to like answer the request
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.240]   that obviously your bank has.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.680]   No, they don't have a request that they're sending you that way.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.320]   If you're really nervous, like call them and be like, hi, are there
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.400]   any alerts on my account?
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.480]   I got a weird text message.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.080]   And they'll probably tell you that it's a scam.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.760]   So just remember to have your guard up.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.160]   Yeah, totally.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.400]   Anytime I get a message, if it's not a six digit number that I asked to be sent
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.840]   to me so I could log in, I'm not paying attention.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:42.080]   And speaking of six digit numbers, I think at this day and age, if you haven't
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:47.240]   added two-factor authentication to all of your financial accounts, I prefer the
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.200]   method of adding to Google Authenticator or something that's not a text message
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.800]   just because if someone gets your phone, if someone gets your phone number, if
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.000]   someone convinces Verizon to change your number, which has been known to happen,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.360]   then you drop your phone in a puddle and can't, can't get the code for the
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.960]   next seven days, been there.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.040]   So I, I'm a big fan and this is actually probably, it's a short-term non-money
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.400]   hack, long-term money hack.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.760]   So I use one password.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.720]   You can store all of your authentication in there.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.880]   So my six digit codes that come up when I log into my bank, those are stored there.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.040]   I drop my phone, they're online.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.680]   I remember my one password and that's it.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:32.720]   And I even have like a security recovery key version of it in an envelope in a
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.160]   safe that if something ever happens, my wife knows where to find it.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.240]   And so I use that.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.400]   It actually costs money.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:44.280]   I, you know, I, I tend to like to pay for things that make my life better and not
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.200]   pay for things that don't.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.400]   And in this case, I'm happy to pay for that service.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.240]   Yeah, that's one of the things that I pay for too, because it just gives me peace
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.560]   of mind to know that there are backups to the backups and it's not just scraps of
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.880]   paper that like I used to tape under my desk.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.120]   Like I used to write my password on a post-it note and tape it under my desk.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.640]   And like, thank God I grew up from that point in my life where I thought that I
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.320]   could just manage my life that way.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   But like you said, a lot of these things that we talk about when it comes to
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.480]   managing your money, they're not sexy and they're not something that will directly
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.720]   help you make or save money, but they're going to help your overall financial
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.200]   health or just like your mindset about your finances.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.840]   And I think that's so important to remember because you can get caught up in
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.280]   trying to hack every hack, but if you're thinking holistically about just sort of
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:32.360]   like having that healthy path for yourself and your money, that's going to
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.560]   take you the furthest.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.040]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.720]   So I have a totally off the wall question.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.200]   Was there a hack that you liked that the publisher wouldn't let you put in the
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:41.560]   book?
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.800]   No, but there was one that I thought they weren't going to let me put in there.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.360]   It is hack number 78, which says stop buying books.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.720]   I was like, she's never going to let me keep this in.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.960]   I need to sell books.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:57:01.360]   But especially during the pandemic, this has become a lifesaver to be able to
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.120]   borrow books, including electronic books, instead of buying each and every title
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:06.640]   new.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.160]   I just tore through books during the pandemic.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.880]   So this is one that really came in handy.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.080]   So there are a couple of different ways.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.240]   There's the library extension app, libraryextension.com.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.440]   It's a browser that you can add to Chrome and Firefox.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.480]   And when a book is available at your local library and you are searching for books
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:27.600]   on like a bookstore on the internet, it will tell you that your library has it and
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.840]   it will prompt you to be like, do you want to put this book on hold instead of
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.120]   spending $21.95 for it?
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.800]   So that's genius.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.080]   I'm also a fan of the Libby app to check out e-books from your library.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:43.120]   You can also check out magazines from your library and electronic versions that are
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.640]   nice to read on the iPad, right?
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:52.120]   So I am someone who loves to buy books, but really does not need to buy that many
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:56.680]   more books. So it's funny that I'm here to promote my book that I wrote and hope
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.960]   that people buy it. But I'm sharing this like secret hack with you that's like stop
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.040]   buying books. But they let me keep that in.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.920]   It made it in. It's on page 78.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.280]   So we've gone through a bunch of hacks.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.800]   Obviously, if someone wants more hacks, there are so many in the book.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.520]   Are there ones that you're just like, wait, wait, wait, there's one more.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.640]   I have to say this.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.520]   Hack 89 is called Try Every Weird Tip Once, and this is the one that I want to like
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:28.400]   leave you with, because when you see a book that has more than 250 hacks, you might
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.040]   think to yourself, I'm going to try all of them.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.480]   I'm going to be so good at this.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.880]   I'm going to make them all work for me.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.280]   If I apply them all, life would be great.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:39.360]   But no, you will get overwhelmed and it's not going to be fun anymore.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.760]   And you're just going to become a crumbling mess of hacks.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.640]   So what this specific hack recommends is try every weird thing you read once.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   Just give it a shot.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:54.760]   And if it doesn't work for you, leave it be, abandon it and do not feel bad because
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   you tried it. So if you think of a frugal blog or a book that's telling you about the
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.960]   frugal lifestyle is like a little too frugal and like maybe you don't want to wash
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:09.000]   your tinfoil to get two or three uses out of it, you don't have to do that.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.360]   You can choose what works for your financial lifestyle and your day to day.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:17.640]   So embrace the weird, find what works for you.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.960]   If there are things in either this book or other places that you're listening or
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.560]   reading and they just seem a little bit off the wall, just remember you only have to
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.360]   take what you like or take what works for you and leave the rest.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.680]   You know, those other tips might be for someone else.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.080]   And don't get bogged down by this feeling that you have to be an overachiever and
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.880]   try them all. You can just find a couple that really work for you and just embrace
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.600]   them. Yeah, I think this is my whole purpose behind this this show and all the
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.960]   hacks is trying to find them all.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.000]   It's not to do them all. It's to find them all.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.080]   And then you can decide which ones make sense for you.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.320]   So, yeah, this was fantastic.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:55.360]   If you're listening and you want all the hacks about money, you can buy Lisa's book.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.280]   It's incredible.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.360]   Where else can people find you online?
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.640]   So you can find me at LisaRowan.com.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:07.120]   That is my website. It also has a link to buy the book if you are looking for an easy
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.080]   route. I'm also everywhere on the Internet at Lisa Teller, which probably I mean, you
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.160]   can find me on Peloton.

[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.440]   I deleted that account, but find me on the Internet at Lisa Teller.

[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.880]   to share. Yes, thanks for hanging with me and letting me share some of my favorites.

[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.360]   Awesome. That was amazing.

[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.240]   I wish we could have gotten through more of Lisa's money hacks because some of the ones
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.160]   we missed really are great, but I'll try to include them in a future episode.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:58.000]   Also, thank you so much for all the listener support you've given me over email and
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.200]   Twitter. It has been fantastic.

[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.600]   hacks, you can find me at Chris@AllTheHacks.com or @Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.840]   Finally, if you're enjoying the show, please consider sharing it with your network or
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.120]   leaving a rating and review in the podcast app.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.400]   That's all for today. See you next time.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:39.280]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.080]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.240]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.320]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.160]   clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.720]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.760]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.920]   entertaining. I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.520]   recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.280]   your mind. And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.720]   participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.360]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.320]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.200]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.560]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.720]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.120]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.560]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
