[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   I should like to call your attention this morning to that great incident in the life
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.600]   of Moses and of the children of Israel, the account of which we read at the beginning,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.120]   as it is to be found in the book of Exodus in chapters 32 and 33.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.880]   But I want to deal particularly with that first section in chapter 33, which runs from
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.080]   the first verse to verse 11, the first 11 verses in the 33rd chapter of the book of
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.160]   Exodus, if you like, in particular the fourth verse.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.020]   And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, and no men did put on him his
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.520]   ornaments.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.920]   Now this record here, this 33rd chapter in particular, is one of the great chapters of
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920]   the Old Testament.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.120]   Judged from any standpoint whatsoever, it is a great and a glorious chapter, and it
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.120]   certainly is one of the crucial episodes in the long and chequered history of the children
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.280]   of Israel.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   And as the New Testament tells us, these things were written for our ensembles.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.960]   There is no doubt at all that the Holy Spirit led the early church, even when it had become
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.520]   mainly Gentile, to incorporate the Old Testament scriptures with their new scriptures for that
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.600]   very reason, that the Old Testament is full of illustrations and full of teaching, which
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.400]   are of great and of profound value to all of us who are in the Christian life and the
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.040]   Christian faith.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.080]   That is why it is the height of folly always to ignore the Old Testament and to fail to
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.280]   see the gospel and the principles of gospel teaching in the Old Testament as well as in
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.560]   the New.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.240]   And so you find the New Testament writers constantly referring back to what happened
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.560]   to the children of Israel.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.640]   They were, if you like, the church under the old dispensation.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.400]   But now I am calling attention to this in particular because it again throws very great
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.900]   light indeed upon this whole question which we are considering at the present time, namely
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.440]   the question of revival and of spiritual awakening in the church.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.940]   It is, as I say, in many respects again one of these perfect Old Testament illustrations
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.360]   of what happens to the church when she is in a period of aridity and dryness and then
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.720]   comes out into a period of reawakening and of revival.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.760]   What we shall be considering here is something that has been repeated many, many times in
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.240]   the long history of the Christian church.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.480]   Now the peculiar feature about this particular account is that it enables us, perhaps more
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.840]   clearly than anything else we have considered hitherto, to realize how revival comes.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:32.640]   The kind of process, the mechanism which is to be seen so clearly in the coming of revival
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   into and upon the church.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.880]   Let me make this quite plain and clear.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.320]   While I am thus dealing with it mainly and chiefly in general, considering the church
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.840]   in general and the need of revival, obviously at the same time it is a perfect message for
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.920]   the individual.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.880]   What revival really means is, of course, something happening at one and the same time to a number
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.120]   of individuals.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.360]   But there is no need for us to wait until revival comes to have individual experiences.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   So all we shall be considering has an immediate and direct application to any individual who
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.880]   may be in the condition that I am about to describe.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.000]   This is something, I say, that is personal and individual as well as more general.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.320]   Now here what we are told about the way in which revival comes is brought before us in
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.560]   a particularly instructive manner with regard to this point, that there are, generally speaking,
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.280]   stages and steps in the coming of revival.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.240]   You will never find practically in all the histories of revival that the church suddenly,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.360]   in one move, as it were, in one step, passes from her condition of lifelessness and almost
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:08.200]   moribund state immediately into a condition of mighty power and revival and influence.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.840]   No, there are generally particular steps and stages.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.000]   And the glory of this particular incident here is that it helps to bring out very plainly
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.640]   and clearly in this anecdotal manner these steps and stages.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.160]   Very well, all I have got to do is to put the story before you.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.720]   It indeed almost preaches itself.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.440]   Nothing could be simpler than the exposition of this particular incident in the life of
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   these children of Israel.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.920]   Well, very well, let us start with the position.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.560]   What was their condition?
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.440]   And I read that portion from the thirty-second chapter in order that you might have the background.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.400]   Here was one of the most serious declensions that ever took place in the story of these
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.040]   people.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.780]   You remember how, almost from the very moment that they were delivered from the captivity
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.040]   of Egypt, they began to grumble and to complain and in various ways to backslide.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   But this is certainly the most serious thing that they ever did.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.520]   Moses had been called up unto the mount by God in order to receive the law.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.560]   And there he had remained a number of days, leaving the people behind with Aaron, as it
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.280]   were, in charge of them.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.200]   But you remember, as the record tells us, the people became impatient.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.520]   They said, "Where is this Moses, this man who persuaded us to come out of Egypt and
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.200]   who has landed us here in this wilderness?
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   What has happened to him?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.800]   Does he not care about us?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   Where is this man?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.840]   And where is this God of whom he spoke, who was going to give us such blessings and who
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.600]   was going to lead us into a land of milk and honey?
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.520]   What has happened to this fellow Moses?" they said.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.000]   And they became utterly impatient.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.560]   And they turned to Aaron and they said, "Look here, we are tired of this.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.440]   We are not going to wait any longer for him, nor that God whom he claims to represent.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.520]   Make us another God."
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.720]   And you remember that Aaron told them to pull off their earrings and so on.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.680]   And he took all these and he threw them into a fire and they were all molten and he fashioned
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.180]   it into the form of a golden calf.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.560]   And they proceeded to worship the golden calf and said, "This is the God that brought us
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.720]   up out of Egypt."
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:42.880]   And not only did they worship the golden calf, but they proceeded to open sin and vice and
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   evil.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:51.640]   They danced before him and behaved themselves in an utterly and thoroughly disgraceful manner.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.600]   Now that is the essence to the background.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:03.560]   It is a story of disobedience, a story of rebellion, a story of their making their own
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.800]   God and proceeding to worship him.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.640]   There it is, false worship.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.000]   Man arrogating unto himself the power to decide who is to be his God.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.760]   And in turn, of course, it led, as I say, to sin and vice, open immorality and shameful
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.120]   and disgraceful behavior.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:35.560]   Now we have not got time to go into the application of these things in detail, but surely anyone
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:41.280]   who has any spiritual sensitivity at all and any knowledge of the Scriptures and of the
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.640]   history of the last hundred years in the Church will know that this, alas, is far too true
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:56.120]   a portrayal and representation of the state of the Christian Church at this present moment.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.760]   The Church has been repeating this very thing, chiefly, of course, in the matter of setting
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   up its own God.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.600]   How do you demonstrate that, says someone?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.560]   Well, unfortunately, but too simply.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.060]   What has been happening, you see, for the last hundred years in the so-called new critical
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.680]   attitude to the Scripture, has been just a repetition of this very thing.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.080]   Man has no longer been receiving the revelation and submitting to it.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.880]   He has been setting himself as a judge on the revelation and has been determining what
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   it ought to be.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.280]   It has been the making of a golden calf.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.920]   It has been the setting up of a new God.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.680]   The Church, and I am speaking of the Church particularly, has set herself over the book
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.000]   and above the book.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.740]   Philosophy has taken the place of revelation, and men have not hesitated and still do to
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.400]   express their opinions on the God of the Old Testament.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.160]   A prominent Church leader in another country has referred to the God of the Old Testament
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.600]   as a bully, in whom he did not believe.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.240]   There are men calling themselves Christian preachers in this country who say they do
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.160]   not believe in that God of the Old Testament sitting upon Mount Sinai and blowing out his
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.160]   threatenings.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.720]   They say they believe in the God of the New Testament, of the Lord Jesus Christ, as if
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   he did not believe in the God of the Old Testament.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.600]   Well, I need not keep you with these things, but you see, it has been a repetition of this
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   story.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.480]   Men have been fashioning their own God.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.360]   They have done the same with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.840]   They do not believe in miracles, therefore they say they did not happen.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.920]   These are but myths, not having real actuality in fact, but representing spiritual truths.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.200]   They deny the virgin birth, the miracles, the literal physical resurrection, and so
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   on.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.280]   Now all this, of course, is but a repetition of this story.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.680]   There they did it in a very crude way.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.120]   They actually fashioned and made a calf out of gold, these golden earrings and so on,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.000]   and set up some objective God.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.920]   But in principle there is no difference whatsoever.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.200]   It is man making his own God, deciding and determining what he is like, and who is to
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   be believed and what is to be believed.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.920]   And then they proceed to offer some kind of worship to their own creation.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.560]   And of course, as invariably happens, you cannot separate these things, you know.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:40.280]   Once man begins to do that, inevitably you get a moral declension following.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.460]   These people did not stop at making a golden calf and worshipping him.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.680]   They began to dance and to drink and to sin.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.080]   They became guilty of gross immoralities.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.880]   And of course we have witnessed the same thing.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.200]   These clever people who said that they were going to make this new God because the old
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.240]   evangelical religion was not ethical and was not moral and social.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.960]   These people who did that in those terms have produced the moral conditions that we have
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.160]   today.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.340]   You cannot have morality without godliness.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.680]   The most moral periods in the history of this country have been the periods that have followed
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.920]   revivals and spiritual awakening.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.480]   And though men fashion their new God in the name of ethics, what happens is a decline
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.760]   in ethics and a collapse of morality.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.040]   So we have had the selfsame thing in the church and in the world.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:45.960]   False worship, false religion, false gods, and an appalling state of evil, sin, and vice.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   What happened?
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.200]   Well, you remember what happened.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:57.400]   God punished these people, and he always punishes sin.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.600]   God punished these people.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.240]   I have said many times from this pulpit, I repeat it again, I regard the two world wars
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:11.600]   which we have experienced in this century as God's punishment of the apostasy of the
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.800]   last century.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.080]   I see no other adequate explanation of it.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.640]   God punished the people in a terrible manner, partly physical.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.600]   He did it through Moses.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.120]   And then you remember there was this great call that was issued by Moses, who came down
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.840]   from the mount and saw this appalling condition.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.760]   Moses sends out his great challenge.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.040]   Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, "Who is on the Lord's side?
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:48.480]   Let him come unto me." and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.080]   That invariably happens after such a state of affairs.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.680]   A clarion call is issued, and there is a kind of separation.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.320]   And thank God we know something even about this.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.360]   There is a separation in the church today.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.960]   Let's be perfectly clear about it.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.920]   There are those, thank God, who always protested against this new attitude to the scriptures.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   There have been those who have kept the flame, who have realized that this is the truth and
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.280]   none other.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.520]   And there is a call today to separation.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.360]   And it's the only distinction in the church which I recognize at all.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.960]   Those who submit to the word of God and its revelation and its teaching, and those who
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.160]   don't.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.320]   I have no interest in denominations.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.760]   My one interest is in this separation.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.600]   Who is on the Lord's side and who worships his own God and his own ideas and his own
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   thoughts?
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.800]   That's the first thing that we are told.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:56.160]   But then, and this brings us to our immediate matter, Moses interceded, you remember.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.760]   It's one of the most glorious statements found in the whole of scripture on the lips
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   of a man.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.480]   Moses returned unto the Lord and said, "All these people have sinned a great sin and have
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.720]   made them gods of gold.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.920]   Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin."
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   And a dash.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.920]   He paused.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.920]   He didn't go on.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:30.440]   And then he resumed after a while, "And if not, block me, I pray thee, out of thy book
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.320]   which thou hast written."
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.200]   Moses becomes an intercessor.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.640]   He becomes a kind of type of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.320]   He becomes a mediator.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   He stands between the people and the wrath of God and says, "Punish me."
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   He couldn't bear it, of course.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.480]   It was too much.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.000]   And yet the noble spirit of Moses shines out so clearly in this great incident.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.800]   But I say the thing I'm anxious to call attention to is God's reply to Moses' intercession.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.280]   And that is what we have in the first three verses of this thirty-third chapter.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.480]   The Lord said unto Moses, "Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.520]   brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swear, and to Abram, to Isaac,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.060]   and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.000]   And I will send an angel before thee, and I will drive out the Canaanite, Amorite, Hittite,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.040]   Perisite, Hivite, Jebusite.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.560]   Go unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:37.800]   For I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.680]   consume thee in the way."
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.480]   Now this is the significant thing.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.720]   God's reply to Moses was to this effect.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.640]   He said, "I have given this promise to these people, that they shall go to that land of
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.080]   promise, that land of Canaan, which is flowing with milk and honey.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.000]   And therefore I tell you now, lead them up.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.160]   Take them to the land of promise.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.920]   In view of what they have done, I am no longer coming up with you.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   I have been in the midst of you."
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.880]   And he had represented his presence, you remember, by the cloud and the pillar of fire by night.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.680]   He said, "I am not coming up any longer amongst you."
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.600]   In a sense, he says, "God, I dare not come, lest I may consume you.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.800]   I am going to send an angel to lead you and to remove your enemies from before you."
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.000]   "So very well," he says to Moses, "lead them up.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Go along.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.280]   I have pointed you as leader.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   Take these people up.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.440]   Enter into the land of possession and of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.920]   I am not coming with you, but I am sending an angel who will help you.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   Go ahead."
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:50.120]   Now then, that is the position.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:57.800]   And what is of such great interest to us is to see the reaction of Moses and the Church
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   to that.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:09.080]   Now then, this is the first stage always in revival.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.600]   You see the position they were in, the sin, God's pronouncement, God's judgment upon
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.600]   it.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.200]   What is the first stage, the first step in revival?
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:28.160]   Well, here it is, a realization of the position.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.480]   These people who had rebelled and turned their backs upon God and had blasphemed his name
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.080]   and had criticized his servant Moses and had caused Aaron to make the calf and worship
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.280]   him and who had sinned, suddenly they are arrested.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:48.760]   They realized something at Inuit of the situation in which they were.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.560]   Now obviously this is a matter of final importance.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.800]   There is no hope of revival apart from this.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.080]   It is an awakening, I say, to the situation.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.960]   It is a consciousness of the seriousness of the situation.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:18.240]   It is an awareness of the implications of what God has said, that he is going to withdraw
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.880]   his presence from them and that he has done so.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.640]   The cloud had disappeared.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.960]   The pillar of fire was no longer in evidence.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   God had said he'd withdraw and God had withdrawn.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.640]   The visible signs and symbols of his presence had gone.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   And furthermore, there was a consciousness and a realization of his displeasure.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.720]   Now I defy you to read the history of any revival, any record that has ever been written
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.680]   of any great spiritual movement in the history of the Church, but that you will find at once
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.080]   that this always happens, without a single exception.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.280]   You remember the dawning consciousness in the case of Martin Luther of the abuses in
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.400]   the medieval Church, all the sale of indulgences and things like that.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.600]   That was the first thing with which he really began to deal.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.760]   Before he was clear about his doctrine of justification by faith, he became aware of
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:27.120]   the appalling state of the Church, the sin of the Church, the disgraceful condition,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.320]   and all the idolatry that had come in and was concealing the worship of the true God
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.920]   and of his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.800]   He awakened to that, exactly as these people did.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:48.960]   And this is of necessity the first stage.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:55.120]   I would be very much happier in this pulpit this morning if I could say with confidence
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.600]   that there was evidence of this in the Church today, speaking generally.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.440]   I would thank God if I could say that there was some indication that men and women had
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:13.760]   been halted and were pausing and were beginning to face the facts and beginning to see the
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   true condition of the Christian Church.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.720]   Is there any evidence of that?
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.680]   There is no hope of true revival until there is, in some moderate.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.960]   This is the first step.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:40.000]   Dare I say even that I don't see much of this in the evangelical section of the Church.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.880]   Our peculiar danger, of course, is to segregate ourselves in mind, in thought, and then to
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.960]   be so busy with our meetings.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.720]   They come round every year, our anniversaries and our meetings and the reports of what we've
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:58.320]   done, our summer campaigns and winter campaigns, and it's all so marvellous and so wonderful.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.800]   We don't seem to realise that anything is wrong.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:10.040]   But my dear friends, the way to test the condition of the Church is not to compare and to contrast
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.980]   her with that which is evidently and obviously wrong.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.520]   The way to test the condition of the Church is to examine her in the light of the New
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.000]   Testament picture of the Church, or to examine the Church in the light of what she has been
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.840]   like always in every great period of reformation and of revival, with the presence of God in
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:41.880]   the midst, with great spiritual manifestations of his presence and of his glory.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:48.360]   And I wonder what even the evangelical section of the Church looks like when she compares
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:57.280]   herself with that, when she estimates herself in terms of spirituality, when she estimates
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.120]   herself in terms of her knowledge of God.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.520]   Not a knowledge about him, but a knowledge of him, direct experiences with him and of
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.680]   his presence, the thing that I shall be going on, God willing, to deal with in subsequent
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.880]   Sunday mornings.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.140]   Are you satisfied with the condition of the Church?
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.440]   Are you satisfied with your own condition?
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.520]   You believe the truth, you're evangelical, you're not a liberal in your theology.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.500]   All right, but is that enough?
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:34.540]   What is her spiritual state and condition in reality?
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:42.580]   How do we feel when we read the experiences of these apostles, the apostle Paul and others?
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.000]   Can we say honestly with him that we're in a kind of state of tension, as he was,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.240]   saying that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.320]   his sufferings, not as though I had already attained, forgetting the things that are behind
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.060]   I press forward?
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:05.120]   Do you feel the tension, the concern, the stretching, the pressing on?
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.200]   How much do we know of that?
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.000]   Can we honestly say that we rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ with a joy unspeakable and
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.960]   full of glory?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:26.640]   Can we say with Paul that to us to live is Christ and to die is gain, that we may be
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.480]   with Christ which is far better?
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.120]   How do you feel when you contemplate death?
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.080]   How do you feel when you take an ill and lay it aside and begin to have to think about
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   possible death?
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.640]   How do you feel?
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.320]   Now these are the ways in which we are to test ourselves.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.720]   There is no hope, I say, for true prayer for revival and intercession unless we realize
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   that there is a need.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.280]   He's all well with us.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.440]   Can we be satisfied?
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.080]   Can we sit back and fold our arms and say things are going marvelously?
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.280]   Look at the reports.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.160]   Are we like these people at this point or are we like the Laodiceans saying that we
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.960]   are rich, we have abundance, that all is well with us and failing to realize that we are
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.200]   poor and wretched and blind?
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:28.360]   While I say may God give us grace to examine ourselves and to be honest with ourselves,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:35.240]   do we realize the difference between the church as she is depicted in the New Testament and
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   ourselves?
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:43.560]   Do we realize that God's displeasure is upon the church?
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:50.960]   Why has there been such a long interval since last God came down amongst his people in revival?
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.000]   Why this appallingly long period?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.940]   Why are things as they are?
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.480]   Why is the church counting for so little?
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.440]   Why is she so ineffective?
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.120]   Why is it that men and women are living in sin as they are and things are going from
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.600]   bad to worse?
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.760]   My dear friends, the first step is that you and I have to realize these things, have to
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.400]   be pulled up by them, have to begin to think about them, become concerned about them, have
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.160]   a deep awareness of the position as it is.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.520]   But of course it didn't stop there.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.140]   That is of no value in and of itself.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.040]   You go on to the second thing which is mentioned in verse 4 of this 33rd chapter.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:43.060]   When the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, they mourned, and no man did
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.160]   put on him his ornaments.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:50.500]   Here's the thing, repentance.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.620]   You can't of course repent unless you face the facts.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:59.100]   But having faced the facts, the question is, do you go on to repentance?
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.700]   There is a cursory superficial facing of the facts that is of no value at all.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.460]   Isn't that the difference really between remorse and repentance?
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.500]   The man who suffers remorse is a man who in a sense looks at the facts, but he doesn't
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   spend much time about it.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   "Oh," he says, "I was a fool.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.620]   I shouldn't have done that, and I'm suffering now because I did."
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.420]   Forgets it, goes on.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   That's remorse.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.780]   It's of no value.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.260]   Repentance is a much, much deeper thing.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.620]   Now let me read to you the classical statement as to what repentance means in order to save
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   time.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:39.140]   The apostle Paul has put it for us once and forever in the second epistle to the Corinthians
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.580]   in chapter 7.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.740]   Let me begin to read at verse 8.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.540]   He says, "For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.860]   For I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season."
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.860]   Now listen.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:59.700]   "Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:08.660]   For ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:15.980]   For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.420]   world worketh death."
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.820]   That's remorse and that's useless.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:26.340]   "For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.660]   What carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation,
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:38.940]   yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:45.220]   In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.540]   Now that is a perfect definition of what is meant by true repentance, but look at it in
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:54.140]   the case of these children of Israel, where it is illustrated so perfectly.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.140]   What does repentance mean?
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.060]   Well it doesn't mean that you just are pulled up and are aware that things are not as they
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.220]   ought to be and that there is something seriously wrong.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:11.780]   No, you go on to a realization of the seriousness of it all and of its appalling character.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.600]   They hated themselves for it.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.020]   That is what Paul is saying about those Corinthians.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:25.600]   You didn't merely glance at it, you examined yourself, you pummeled yourself, you hit yourselves,
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:31.220]   you punched yourselves, you hated yourselves, you took revenge on yourselves.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.420]   And that my dear friends is an essential part of repentance.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.140]   A man awakens to the seriousness of what he has done.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.860]   These people said, "We've turned our backs on God, we've made this God this golden
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.100]   carpenter, we've worshipped him and we've sinned, we've disgraced ourselves, there
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:54.260]   we are in our nakedness, we've been dancing before a mere idol created by our own hands."
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:59.100]   And it came home to them and they hated the thing, they abominated it, they condemned
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.060]   themselves root and branch.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:13.620]   Ah, but still more important than that, they realized the seriousness of sin in God's
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.620]   sight.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:20.620]   They said, "If it's this to us now that we've come to ourselves, what must it be
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.780]   to God?"
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.060]   Oh, the prodigal son knew that, didn't he?
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.580]   He thought he was wonderful until he found himself in that field with a swine, he came
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.940]   to himself.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.780]   And the first thing was, he saw himself what a fool he'd been, and he kicked himself,
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:40.260]   he hated himself, he condemned himself, and then he thought of his father.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.260]   If I see it like this, what must it have been to father when in my arrogance I asked for
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.980]   my share of the goods and left home and spurned all that he and home had represented to me?
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.420]   If it's this to me, what was it to him?
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.220]   How can I go back and face him?
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:00.980]   Oh, how he must have suffered.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.420]   Do we ever think of what our sin is like in the sight of God?
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.660]   I know realization of sin makes us feel uncomfortable, and we want to get over it quickly, so we
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.660]   ask of forgiveness.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:21.100]   Do you go through the stage of realizing what it must be to God that we, his creatures,
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:26.660]   his people for whom he has done everything, should turn our backs upon him and in our
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.860]   folly and selfishness make our own gods and go our own way?
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.860]   Oh, go, I say, and read the history of revivals again.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.500]   Watch the individuals at the beginning.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.220]   This is the first thing that happens to them invariably.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:45.580]   They begin to see what a terrible, appalling thing sin is in the sight of God.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.900]   They even forget the state of the church temporarily and forget their own anguish.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.140]   It's this in the sight of God, how terrible it must be.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   Never has there been a revival but that some of the people, especially at the beginning,
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.940]   have had such visions of the holiness of God and the sinfulness of sin that they've scarcely
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.420]   known what to do with themselves.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.580]   Some of them have felt it so acutely as we've seen that they've even collapsed physically.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.580]   That doesn't matter.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:18.060]   The thing is the realization of sin in the presence of God, and especially this.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:25.300]   What these people suddenly came to realize was that because of their sin and because
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:34.660]   of God's view of sin, God was withholding his presence from them and was telling them
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.300]   to go up to the land of Canaan without him, sending an angel.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.620]   But he wasn't going to come.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.820]   The God who'd entered among them as it were in Egypt, the God whose power they'd felt
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.540]   as they were traveling in the direction of the Red Sea, the God who was there amongst
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.780]   them with Piahiroth and Belzephon, one on each side and the hosts of Pharaoh behind
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:02.260]   and the Red Sea in front, the God who'd come down and had divided the sea, this mighty
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:09.460]   presence, this holy, glorious God, he's no longer going to be with them.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.780]   That was the thing, you know, that filled them with dismay.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:19.220]   That was the thing that alarmed and caused these people to mourn.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:26.140]   When the people heard these evil tidings, and that was the evil tidings, "I will not
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:30.580]   go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee in
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.580]   the way."
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.740]   What troubled them was not the threat of being consumed, but that God had said, "I'm not
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.740]   coming with you.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.180]   You've got to go up alone.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.460]   I'm sending an angel, but I'm not coming."
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.340]   Oh, this is a tremendous thing.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.980]   This is the heart of the whole matter.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:54.780]   Men and women, when they're truly awakened, begin to realize that there is nothing which
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:01.260]   is so serious as to be without the presence of God.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.960]   Do you get its full force?
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.260]   God was sending them to the promised land.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.260]   God was saying, "Go up.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.820]   I've promised you the land of Canaan.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.900]   I'm going to give it you.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.020]   You shall go to the land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.740]   I'll send my angel before you to destroy these enemies, these Amorites, these Hittites,
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.740]   Go along.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.900]   Go up to your promised land.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.940]   I've brought you out of the captivity of Egypt.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.940]   I'm sending you on.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.940]   Go ahead.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:27.940]   Lead them, Moses.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.700]   I'll send an angel with you."
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.020]   The people said, "No.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.380]   If you're not coming with us, we don't want to go."
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:41.780]   Now that's the essence of spiritual understanding.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:47.340]   And that's the thing, my dear friends, that you and I have got to come to.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.020]   You see, here were the people who suddenly awakened, who came to this tremendous, profound
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:59.500]   realization that to be given every other blessing is of no value if God doesn't do it with
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   you.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   What's the value of Canaan?
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.100]   What's the value of milk and honey?
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.820]   What's the value of having possessions?
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:10.260]   If you are not with us, they saw that the realization of the presence of God, having
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:18.100]   his fellowship and company, was infinitely more important than everything else.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:22.500]   Need I apply this to the church today?
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:29.540]   You can have successes over your enemies, you know, without this great realization of
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.100]   God in the midst.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.500]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.300]   There are angels who can do that for us.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.820]   Destroy certain of our enemies, take us to the land.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.820]   We're in Canaan.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.260]   We've got the milk and honey.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.660]   Yes, everything seems to be all right.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:52.220]   There's an appalling verse in Psalm 106 where we are told to the children of Israel, "God
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:58.180]   granted them their requests but sent leanness into their souls."
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.460]   You can have an outward prosperity and affluence.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.380]   The church may seem to be doing remarkably well.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:09.020]   Good finances, good figures, successes, conversions, enemies defeated, everything going well.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.820]   And the newspapers report it.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.300]   The Christian newspapers report it.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.020]   It all seems to be marvelous.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.940]   But the appalling question I ask is this.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.620]   Is God in the midst?
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.340]   Is he really amongst us?
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.740]   Are we aware, as we should be, of his glorious presence?
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.500]   That's the thing that got these people.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.860]   And what they said in effect was, "Canaan's no use to us.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.380]   Milk and honey are of no value.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.220]   We're not interested in these enemies.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.340]   We want you."
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:50.840]   "Oh," says the Psalmist, "it is for thee I cry out as the heart panteth after the waterbrooks.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.940]   So panteth my soul after thee, O God."
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.180]   He's not after blessings.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.580]   He's after God, the living God.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.140]   "Yes," says Paul, "oh, I've been a successful evangelist.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:08.220]   I've done so much, but oh, I'm not satisfied that I might know him and the power of his
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.740]   resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings."
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.140]   "No, no," they said, "we can't go on without you.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.460]   The presence of God is essential."
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:24.060]   They came to that realization.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:35.500]   And as I say, their realization was that no outward prosperity and no type of success
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:41.460]   can compensate for the absence of God.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:50.340]   What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.860]   I'm not asking you this morning whether you're living a good life.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.540]   I'm not asking you whether you're happy.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.220]   I'm not asking you whether you read your Bible and whether you pray.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.380]   I'm not asking whether you're active in church work or in some other form of Christian activity.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.860]   What I'm asking you is this.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.340]   Do you know God?
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.780]   Is he with you?
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.540]   Is he in your life?
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.540]   Is he in the camp?
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:20.060]   Or are you traveling on with God as it were somewhere in the distance, giving strength
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.860]   and power by his angel and by his leader and so on?
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:33.580]   But the question is, what of you in your personal relationship and your personal dealings with
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.740]   God?
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.380]   These people repented.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:43.660]   And the end of repentance and the ultimate of repentance is just that, to realize that
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:48.820]   nothing matters except my relationship to God.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:56.340]   That nothing, please nor pain me, apart, O Lord, from thee.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.700]   They not only faced the situation, they repented.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:08.420]   But you see, and oh, how perfect the Scripture is, they gave absolute proof that they had
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.420]   repented.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:15.900]   And again, this is one of the differences between remorse and repentance, because repentance
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.860]   is not just a passing, temporary feeling.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:24.300]   Repentance is something that is so profound that it affects a man's will.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.900]   As the apostle again puts it in 2 Corinthians 7, in the verses I read to you, it leads to
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   action.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.420]   You put things right, Sir Paul, you did something about it.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.820]   And a man has never repented until he has done in practice what he feels he ought to
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.820]   do.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.820]   And these people did it.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:43.300]   Here it is, "And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.820]   But no man did put on him his ornaments.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:51.220]   For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   people.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.660]   I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.460]   Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:10.220]   And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the Mount Horeb."
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.960]   And we haven't repented truly until we've done that in whatever shape or form it may
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.520]   be true of us.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:24.020]   It means this, that having had this profound realization of our sinfulness and especially
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:30.040]   in his sight, our one desire now is to do everything we can that is well-pleasing in
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.540]   his sight.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.540]   And what is it?
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.500]   Well, it means forsaking sin and doing his commandments.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.260]   "Pluck off your ornaments."
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:46.820]   And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.540]   Yes it was these ornaments that had led to their downfall.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.600]   These were the things out of which the golden calf had been made some of them.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.620]   And they hate the very thought of the whole thing.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.580]   And God says, "Strip yourselves of them."
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.580]   And they stripped themselves.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.460]   Oh, I needn't keep you.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.220]   You've only got to read Christian biographies.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.940]   And I say again, the story of revivals, to see exactly what I mean.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.180]   There is always this stripping.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.140]   Men and women are aware that they've been doing things that they shouldn't do.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.900]   They may not have been very harmful in and of themselves, but they stand between them
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.900]   and God.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   So they must go.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.780]   Ornaments vanish.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.260]   Strip themselves.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:38.820]   And they gave themselves to God in a new consecration and in a new dedication.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:49.380]   This I say again is of the very essence of repentance, that we realize that we've got
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.660]   to act.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.500]   We've got to take some steps.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.380]   It's not for me to tell you what they are.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.100]   Because if I do, I shall be preaching to some and not to others.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.500]   But every one of us has got to be stripped of something.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.540]   Every single one of us, without a single exception.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.900]   It's no use just pointing at smoking and drinking or this and that.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.300]   There's something in everybody's life.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   Some ornament.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   And it must go.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.460]   Well, it isn't for me to say that though God did command it.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.060]   What I'm saying is this, that when a man realizes his sinfulness and that the state
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.460]   of the church is due to the fact that he and others are so sinful and what it means in
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:36.140]   the sight of God, a true repentance will lead to such an examination and one will see certain
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.780]   things and one will deal with them gladly and readily.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:46.020]   They strip themselves of their ornaments.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:50.380]   Well, our time has gone again.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:54.100]   And we'll have to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:58.100]   But that isn't all, obviously.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:07.980]   These are but the first steps, the first beginnings, the dawning realization that there is something
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.180]   wrong and profoundly wrong.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:25.940]   And that the call is a call to a godly sorrow, a profound and a deep work of repentance.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.500]   Are you happy about yourself?
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.180]   Are you happy about the state of the church?
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.180]   Is all well?
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.300]   Can we go jogging along?
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.300]   Meeting services, activities?
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   Wonderful!
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.300]   Is it?
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:46.700]   Where is the knowledge of God?
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.180]   Is he in the midst?
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.260]   Is he in the life?
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.740]   What is our relationship to him?
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:05.060]   Face that question and it will lead to this true godly sorrow and repentance which will
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.740]   manifest itself in a practical manner.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:18.740]   May God have mercy upon us, open our eyes to the situation and give us honest minds
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:24.300]   and truth in our inward paths.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.220]   Amen.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.140]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
