[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Love you guys. Hey, if you guys are around, you know, and you
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.960]   want to get a glass of wine and some wine later, maybe next
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.040]   week or something. Who knows? Maybe we'll get together in
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.320]   person. Have a glass of wine. I see you soon. I love you guys.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.400]   You're about to come to Italy and basically you're gonna gain
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.360]   15 pounds.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.640]   Okay, so we were there in Italy.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.800]   This is a long time ago. This is when we were in Venice.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.080]   The quality of Italian white wine is outrageous. Really? It's
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.960]   outrageous.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.840]   Do they have a men's bikini for you? For when we're in Italy? I
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.320]   would buy that.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.120]   Let's just say thank you to the amazing people of Italy for
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.560]   having what an incredible greatest country for adults to
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.520]   go on vacation and what an incredible country.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.640]   Here we go in 3, 2, hey.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.800]   So I was going to everybody. Well,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.760]   Motorcycle. Try it again.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.520]   3, 2, hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the all in
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.480]   podcast. We are here in beautiful Portofino, Italy. And
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.440]   we have found a new bestie. Introduce yourself. Natalie is
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.840]   your name?
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.040]   That is my name. And don't be surprised by my surname.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.520]   Ah, you've got a surname. What is the surname?
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.520]   Pollyangria. No, sorry. Pollyhapitia.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.960]   Pollyhapitia. So your cousins apparently, and you run a
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320]   biotech business, I understand here in Italy.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.800]   In my spare time. Yeah. When somebody else doesn't consume
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.640]   the life out of me.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.760]   Got it. Okay, so you're dealing drugs in Italy. And welcome to
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.600]   the all in pod. In all seriousness, we are here in
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.280]   Italy. Because Chamath and Natalie got married. Big round
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.080]   of applause.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.920]   We decided we tape an episode very quickly. But tell us what
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.520]   was it like at the wedding? Marrying Chamath Pollyhapitia?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.600]   Tell us about the wedding.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   It was, was a lot of work. And Chamath was, as you can expect,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.720]   completely, utterly useless. Yes. We've seen this. In fact,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   in fact, counterproductive. He showed up at times really,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.840]   really frustrating. Yes. But I love him nonetheless. So here
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.480]   we are. Very happy.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.640]   This is the moment I would like to take credit for 30% of the
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.040]   wedding. And then a number that you can't dispute. You don't
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.280]   really know what it means. Yeah. And then everybody ends up
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.520]   thanking you effusively. Because they're like the 30% that they
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.640]   love the most. That was me.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.360]   Yeah, if you want to make an estimate, 20-30% chance is, you
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.600]   can't go wrong. Friedberg and Sacks are with us, the Don.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.200]   Sacks, you had a lot of clandestine meetings here. Are
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.360]   we any closer to peace in Ukraine, Russia? I saw you
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.080]   talking to some Russian emissaries. You've been on the
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.560]   continent for a full month. Tell us how much...
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.360]   Yeah, where did you go for 12 hours yesterday, Sacks?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.680]   Yeah, I know that you've been on some of these crazy yachts out
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.880]   here trying to broker peace. How close are we? And how are you
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.400]   enjoying your time in Europe this summer?
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.840]   I don't think we're too close. But let me say a word about this
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.680]   happy couple here. So Natalie is brilliant and unstoppable.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.160]   Chamath is superficial and plastic. So this was like the
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.120]   wedding of Oppenheimer and Barbie. And in that analogy,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.080]   Chamath, you're Barbie.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.720]   Yes, absolutely. Lots of substance and fire over here. And
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.720]   complete narcissism and plastic over here. Also the genitalia,
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.680]   the same size, they can be very smoothed over. Just barely a
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.080]   bump. Yeah. Okay.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.840]   I'm going to leave you guys at your genitalia.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.240]   Okay, we'll do a show. Natalie, congratulations. We love you,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.480]   sister.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.160]   Congratulations.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.640]   Thank you, J. Cole, because you celebrated our...
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.200]   Okay, that's enough.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.720]   Enough. Okay, here she goes.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.280]   I wasn't talking about Chamath.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.040]   Oh, yeah. Cut you off.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.960]   Okay, here we go. Here we go. What a great, great week we've
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.080]   had here. Lots of friends came in.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.200]   Lots of friends. Lots of special friends.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.880]   Lots of poker.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.680]   Lots of friends. Lots of poker.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.480]   Lots of poker players that weren't invited to the wedding.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.000]   I mean, we walked into the poker game last night and there were
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.440]   all these guys that I didn't see at the wedding. And you invited
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   these guys to come to your poker game.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.520]   No, let's be honest.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   And they didn't get invited to the wedding.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.000]   Let's be honest. I think it was the most unbelievably eclectic
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.720]   guest list of any wedding that's ever happened.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.400]   That's very true.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.120]   I mean, literally, it's like a two by two matrix of villainy,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.760]   wealth, fame, and infamy.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.280]   Yes.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.240]   I mean, you had every quadrant covered.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.640]   Yes.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.600]   It was incredible.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.280]   Sky and I were joking. It's like walking into the bar on
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.920]   Tatooine. Star Wars.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.280]   (Singing Star Wars theme)
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.640]   Got smoking hookah in the corner.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.680]   We don't serve your kind.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.000]   We don't serve your kind.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.720]   People chained up.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.040]   I mean, it was a whole rigmarole last night.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.200]   I could tell that when I was doing my toast, which Shemoth
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.600]   told me, "No holds barred. Just go for it."
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.800]   Because my toast, he really meant roast.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.240]   Roast. Yeah, he roasted.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   The Italians did not get the jokes by the way.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.320]   So half the audience was laughing.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.160]   The poker guys were laughing.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   And then the family section, not laughing.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.840]   No, no.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840]   A lot of stunned silence.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.480]   I think a lot of them got the jokes and they were in on it.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.560]   But what an amazing week we've had here.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.960]   And thank you for hosting us, John.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.320]   Oh, you're welcome.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.720]   It was absolutely wonderful.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.600]   This really is in so many ways.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.560]   By the way, we should cut in some shots in the video on
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.440]   where we're sitting right now.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.800]   This incredible beach club.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   We're looking out here.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.320]   This is a photo odgy, right?
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.120]   Incredible photo odgy.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.000]   People sleuthed it out.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.920]   I posted a photo of us just meeting out there during our
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.400]   little board meeting and people immediately sleuthed out.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.880]   You're at Langosteria.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.440]   Or what's it?
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.760]   Langosteria Paraggi.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.520]   Langosteria.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   I guess famous red beach restaurant.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.640]   I mean, Langosteria has these two incredible
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.600]   restaurants in Milano.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.240]   Three.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.920]   They're just top of the top.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.240]   And they have this incredible beach restaurant here and it's
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.160]   the hotel or sorry, it's the restaurant that is beside the
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.200]   beach club that's also owned by the Splendido where we're,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.360]   where you guys are all staying.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.240]   So yeah, it's been, it's been an amazing couple of days.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.760]   This little block is called Paraggi?
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.800]   This part is Paraggi.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.200]   And then if you go just a little bit further, you're in
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.280]   Portofino proper.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.000]   Amazing.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.440]   Wonderful food.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.720]   Incredible food.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.400]   Unbelievable.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.280]   We've eaten like Kings and Queens as the case may be.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.000]   And just the hospitality in Italy is amazing.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.800]   One of my favorite places.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.160]   I just want to say to all of you guys and to all of our
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.320]   friends, I mean, you guys literally flew halfway around
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   the world for three days.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.960]   You did ruin all our summer plans.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.040]   I mean, it was incredible.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.520]   And frankly, I picked the, we picked the three worst days
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.880]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.000]   If you had a job, you had to work.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.120]   A certain person had two rooms rented at the Splendido just
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.160]   for meetings and he would just be running back meetings and
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.960]   then trying to go to the, I mean, it's incredible.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   You guys, it really means a lot.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.480]   I think this whole thing was a conspiracy to convene a high
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   stakes poker game.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.040]   You knew you were spending the summer in Italy.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   There was no poker here.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.440]   And you're like, how do I get the poker game to come to Italy?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.600]   He probably netted a profit to cover the wedding.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.320]   No, not to cover the wedding.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.480]   But I did, I did win a $1.2 million pot from.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.000]   That was crazy.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.720]   That was crazy.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.200]   My favorite poker story is that you got a call out of the blue
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.800]   from neighborhood.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's the best.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.520]   Get a text.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   Oh my God.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.560]   Need room Splendido.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.040]   I'd like two in the morning.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.400]   And I was, I looked at my phone and I'm like, why is texting me
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.040]   at two in the morning?
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.320]   Need room Splendido.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.480]   And I said, it's Chamath.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.280]   Is everything okay?
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.360]   Do you need any help?
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.960]   Need room Splendido.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.840]   And I said, I'm not your fucking travel coordinator.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.000]   And he goes, can you help me get a room at the Splendido hotel?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.960]   I said, what you're here?
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.720]   So I said, well, why don't you just meander into our game?
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.760]   And so he actually came to the wedding.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.640]   Was he randomly in the neighborhood?
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.960]   He was in the area.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.240]   Well, he was spending a night in, so he thought he would hop over.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.440]   Hey, oh, that's such a bad joke.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.640]   I stole that joke from you.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.320]   You stole it from me.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.840]   I stole it.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.320]   Oh, that's how it works in Hollywood.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.760]   Okay.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.560]   There's a little backstory to all this.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.200]   What happened was Chamath told me in the spring, hey, listen, J-Cal,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.400]   I'm finally, I'm so excited.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.360]   I'm going to marry Nat.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.320]   And I said, oh, that's great.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.640]   You had the kids and now you're getting married.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.440]   It's not the traditional way to do it, but congratulations.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.880]   And he said, yeah, we're going to have like a little thing with our families
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.200]   in Italy, very bespoke, the kids, parents, that's it.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.320]   And then, you know, back in Silicon Valley in the Bay Area,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.120]   we'll have a backyard party for everybody else.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.760]   And I said, great.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.960]   Let me know where in Italy we're going.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.960]   And Nat said, Amore, it's just going to be the immediate family.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.840]   And I said, great.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.640]   Where am I going?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   Tell me the location.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.480]   And if you need an officiant, I'm in.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.080]   And then a week later, we get an email.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.240]   Nat and Chamath discussed it and they said, you know what?
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.400]   J-Cal's right.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.920]   We should invite everybody to Italy.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.120]   And so thanks for making that decision.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.760]   Thank you guys for coming.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.960]   Honestly, it was a dream.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.120]   You didn't tell anyone J-Cal was going to officiate.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.080]   So we're sitting there Italian style for like two hours assembling for the wedding.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.360]   Nothing happens.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.800]   You're all just standing around waiting for something to happen.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.760]   And then Chamath comes in.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.960]   Natalie comes in beautiful, dressed amazing.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.440]   The music is incredible.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.000]   And they sit there for another 10 minutes and they turn around and they say,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.280]   the officiant, we just got a letter.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   The officiant is sick.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.800]   We need someone.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.560]   We need someone to step in.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.480]   And then J-Cal pops up in the back.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.120]   I got it.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.040]   I'll officiant.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.520]   Knocks the Italian royalty to the right and the left.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.560]   Plows his way through the audience, makes his way to the top.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.440]   Pulls out his American bow tie or whatever he had and says, let's do this.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.640]   And then we had J-Cal officiate.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.880]   You did a wedding in a very J-Cal way.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.040]   Yeah. Were you surprised?
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.640]   Yeah, I was surprised.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.240]   You were surprised.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.000]   Yeah. A lot of people were surprised.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.400]   Yeah, you got me.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.760]   Because your original email said J-Cal was going to officiate.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.240]   But then we heard nothing for two and a half months.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.160]   Yeah. And no one really knew.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.560]   And but it was a big secret, right?
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.480]   We kept it a big secret.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.520]   Why not it to be a surprise?
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.880]   And it was just the avows and the poetry.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.920]   Oh, the poetry.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.080]   Oh, the shared was amazing.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.960]   Amore, amore.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.720]   Don't make her. Don't make her.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.640]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.680]   You want to do that?
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.200]   Can you do a dramatic reading of the poem that I wrote for you?
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   Oh, this was a.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.720]   Chamath wrote a poem.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.880]   Roses are red.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.480]   And we'll do the setup that comes before.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.400]   So this the setup was
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.880]   that Nat would read Chamath's poems and Chamath would read Nat's poems.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.520]   And so Nat had this incredible
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.080]   Puello poems, incredibly well thought out.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.840]   And then Chamath wrote a poem from Anonymous
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.960]   that he found at a rest stop on the 280
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.160]   written on the inside of the bathroom stall.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.520]   Roses are red.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.120]   Violets are.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.600]   No, go ahead. Go ahead.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.080]   OK, you remember it.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.280]   You should have it committed to memory.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.840]   Let me think. Yeah.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.880]   Roses are red.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   Pickles are green.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.560]   I love your legs.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.760]   And what's in between?
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.120]   Oh, God, God, it's so embarrassing.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.720]   It was so embarrassing.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.840]   And she had to read this.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.000]   She literally just dropped it in front of all of the Italian.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.480]   And the Americans, the Americans all rolled laughing.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.720]   Horrific.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.480]   It really was like a tattoo.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.000]   Her her her first poem was a sonnet from Malene Shakespeare.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.400]   My first poem was Beyonce's Cuff It.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.240]   Yeah. Where where the last line is, will you sit on top of me?
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.320]   Which she has to say, looking at her dad.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.960]   It was so it was so awkward.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.400]   Then her second poem was
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.760]   something by.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.840]   T.S. Eliot, who was it?
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.400]   Gregory Hoffman, I think it was something Hoffman.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.600]   Yeah. And then mine was.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.280]   Yeah, this anonymous thing.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.480]   And then her third was he Cummings in mine was Dr.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.840]   Seuss. But that was charming.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.360]   It was nice.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.560]   But Dr. Seuss was quite a Daniel Hoffman.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   Yes. Well, we had a great time.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.000]   There's been a lot of news.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.880]   And you got here early, right?
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.640]   And weren't you like camping along the coastline?
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.920]   Because you want to. Yes, I went to camp.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.160]   Decided to bring San Francisco to this beautiful, pristine.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.560]   Yes. Defecating everywhere.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.880]   Leaving a trail of needles in his wake.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.400]   Cosmic needles.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.760]   We're going to have to crash.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.480]   You were trying to show.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.560]   I did. I did post a thirst trap.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.080]   I'm very proud. I'm down 41 pounds from the peak.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.000]   20 pounds with hiking and using the fasting app that Kevin Rose built.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.320]   And then the other half is zero.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.080]   Great fasting app.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.480]   And the other half was Ozempic.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.200]   We go. I understand.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.640]   What does an app do to help you fast?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.480]   You just fast. You don't you click a button.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.280]   Do you eat the app?
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.560]   Gives an animation and then it counts down the clock.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.360]   What you're trying to decide whether to eat or not.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.080]   You push a button.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.600]   Should I eat or not? And it says no.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.680]   Yeah. It shows you a picture of yourself.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.960]   Just a mirror.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.080]   A fat picture. It shows you a fat picture of yourself.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.840]   Yeah. Fat picture.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.400]   That's what I did.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400]   I took a picture of myself like Fat Jason.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.040]   And I just every time I open the refrigerator, it's there.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.000]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.320]   Yes. Is it is it are you not allowed to talk about
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.000]   like fatness now or.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.080]   I have strong feelings on this.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.760]   I think when I ran marathons my whole life,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.920]   I was very svelte, 165 pounds until I was 32.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.520]   And then I added two or three pounds until you guys knew me.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.960]   And I hit 213 at my peak.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.360]   I'm 171 now. 172.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   And, you know, I wish more people would have done an intervention.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.320]   You were very clear with me.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.240]   Hey, you got to lose weight.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.680]   We did. Oh, my God. I have to tell.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.320]   No, no, no, no, no. I'm telling the story.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.520]   No, I can't fucking spike the story. I'm telling the story.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.840]   No, no, no, no. You can't spike the story now.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.280]   This is your wedding present to me. OK, thank you.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   J. Cal. J. Cal is bordering on morbidly obese.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.560]   I was this is when I was two, 13, and you're how tall?
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.720]   Five, nine on a good day. Five and a half.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.080]   Yeah, on a good day, by the way, for all
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.560]   all these people on Twitter, everybody who who meets me always says,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.200]   oh, you look so much shorter on camera.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.440]   Maybe it's because I slouch, but I'm six foot two, just in case everybody's
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.560]   curious on a good day.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.000]   Anyways, J. Cal.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.520]   J. Cal is is bordering on morbidly obese.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.760]   So I make a weight bet with him.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.040]   Yeah, I was two thirteen. I said I can get to one ninety three.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.560]   One. Yeah. One ninety three.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.120]   And I was like, I'll give you 10 K a pound or something.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.240]   Whatever. It's 100 K bet. It was one hundred thousand dollar bet.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.800]   And I had a year. He had a year.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.920]   A year goes by. I put it in my calendar.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.800]   And what I do is I schedule the poker game
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.360]   for the day before knowing that we're going to play through midnight.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.680]   So I'm like, oh, I'm going to set this guy up.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.920]   So I waited a whole year.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.800]   Unbelievable. We play poker.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.440]   The clock strikes midnight and he had been eating pizza and ice cream.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.440]   I'm watching him the whole time.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.320]   I'm going to win this hundred thousand dollars.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.000]   I never said like that.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.840]   I say, hey, it's time. It's twelve.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.920]   Oh, what? It's time for the wait.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.640]   He says, what? Wait, bet.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.840]   And I said, motherfucker, you made a weight bet with me.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.560]   But now I just want to hear ago.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.400]   I have been one ninety two, one ninety three for months.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.440]   I have hit the thing.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.560]   So he says he starts panicking.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.200]   He does. I weigh myself in the morning.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.640]   He says he's panicking.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.760]   He says, OK, give me a few minutes.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.000]   He runs into my child's bedroom and takes a shit.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.840]   I just took a lead. I took a lead.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.880]   Try to lose your graphic.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.840]   He tried to lose the way to admit who can poo at midnight.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.160]   Nobody can poo at midnight.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.400]   Anyway, I get on the scale. I'm one ninety five.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   And so he wants me to take all my clothes off.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.640]   I'm like, no, I say we have to do the way.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   And now, in fairness to Jake, I did not pre agree that I had to
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.880]   that I could pick the time.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.280]   So he says I have until midnight, which is true.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.520]   So I said, OK, fine.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.840]   He goes home, goes home.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.560]   I go in the sun.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.840]   Not eat. He puts on a sweatsuit.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.560]   I go for a run up like Rocky around San Francisco.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.240]   He sweats for four hours.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.520]   He gets like a tenth of a pound under before midnight.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.480]   Yes. And he's like, you owe me one hundred thousand dollars.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.880]   No, then he was kind.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.520]   He said, look, put me in the mini one for one drop, one drop.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.440]   And we'll both go.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.560]   And we'll pull it.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.520]   We'll chop it up. We had a great time.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.120]   Jake, I lost in the first eight hands.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.240]   And I'm not sure I lasted longer than you.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.560]   I should just burn it.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.760]   OK, back to you. But anyway, but but I would say in terms of weight,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.040]   it is pernicious in America.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.760]   I don't think we should be celebrating it or tolerating it.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.280]   I think we should be compassionate.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.840]   I think Ozembek and Wigowi are incredible tools.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.600]   And Manjaro, I don't I didn't talk about it for the first year.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   David, you've done it as well.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.800]   And you've been honest that you've tried Wigowi or whatever,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.240]   and you lost a lot of weight. So congratulations.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.280]   These guys have been skinny forever.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.320]   But I think take it seriously.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.000]   It takes a lot of discipline, but it can be done.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.320]   And I encourage people.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.160]   The gains I've gotten from being 40 pounds lighter have been tremendous.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.400]   I feel great. My energy level is different.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.640]   My thinking is different. My sleep's better. Everything's great.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.680]   And so I just want to be around for a long time
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.480]   so that we can do a thousand episodes of the show for you and the fans.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.880]   And yeah, being fat sucks the end.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.480]   And if you think you think but do you think it's it's being normalized
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.800]   and do you think that that's healthy?
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.600]   What do you think?
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.360]   I like I think right into the microphone.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.640]   No one no one makes no one chooses obesity.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.200]   Obesity is a struggle, just like diabetes.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.800]   No, no one chooses diabetes. Diabetes is a struggle.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.640]   I've done some work, made some investments, been on the board of some companies
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.680]   that have been involved in trying to address the needs in this space.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.360]   And one of the things that we've learned a lot about
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.400]   is how much of a social stigma it feels.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.720]   People that are struggling with obesity and struggling with diabetes
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.640]   don't feel comfortable actively talking about it
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.200]   because they hold a deep amount of shame about it.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   Yes, they recognize that there's something deeply unhealthy about it
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.480]   and they feel deep shame because they're often portrayed as having the choice
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.240]   and making the decisions that got them to this point.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.080]   Yeah. And the truth is, we live in a world with extraordinary abundance
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.200]   in the first world.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.840]   We live in a world with extraordinary opportunities for low cost
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.280]   calorie consumption.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   We find a lot of joy in our lifestyles.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.880]   And, you know, ultimately living a happy life can lead people to a very sad place.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.480]   And so generally, I would say that this is not something
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.800]   that should be stigmatized in in an open way.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.360]   It should be treated with compassion, but it should be spoken about openly,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.800]   which is that there is a challenge and a struggle that people have.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.400]   And we need to help.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.320]   And everyone needs to kind of be cognizant of the fact that that's the thing.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.240]   I think we need to I think we're normalizing it.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.360]   And I think it's wrong.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.640]   Yes, I when I first came to Canada, you see the pictures when I was like
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.000]   fresh off the boat.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.880]   That's what we used to call immigrants.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.800]   I was real thin, skinny, real thin.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.160]   And then after a year of eating whatever food it was that we could afford.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.040]   Yeah, I became really fat.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.240]   And you could see it in the pictures.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.280]   And I was fat all through my grade school.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.520]   I was a little skinny, skinny, fat in the face, but basically fat
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.680]   all through high school.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.040]   And then I finally started working out and taking care of myself.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.840]   And it had a huge impact on my self-esteem and my self-confidence.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.640]   It had a huge impact on my health.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.160]   Yeah, I saw it basically kill my father.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.000]   It's given seven, 11 of my aunts and uncles diabetes.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.120]   So I think that like all of this normalization is unhealthy
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.480]   because it actually is killing people.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.600]   What I learned from the dieting is portion control in America
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.880]   is just out of control.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.280]   It is the wrong portion sizes.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.320]   So you see it here and you see it here when you eat here.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.680]   Here's a little tuna.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.640]   Here's a small pasta.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.600]   You know, here's some cheese and some grapes for dessert. You're done.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.640]   And so once I got my portion control, I was fine snacking also.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.160]   But I just wish anybody who's suffering from it,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.880]   you know, work with your doctors, work with nutritionists.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.640]   You were overweight, too, for a long time.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.400]   Were you?
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.280]   Freeberg? Yeah, I.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.640]   What were you overweight from?
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.520]   I grew up not eating well.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.320]   I was overweight in college.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.000]   Right in the microphone.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.720]   College is when I really started to get exercise actively.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.600]   And because it was never part of my upbringing as a kid was like, eat well,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.920]   get exercise.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.480]   I was very much self-taught.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.560]   I learned how to cook and learned a lot about nutrition on my own.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.920]   And, you know, look, I took action on my own in my early 20s.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.760]   So but yeah, look, I mean, it's so easy to not know where you find yourself
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.440]   and then you find yourself in this place.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.600]   And I do agree that being cognizant of
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.240]   where you are and addressing it in an open way, in an active way,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.760]   is the only path I mean, it's just every every cycle we come around
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.240]   with some new easy solution.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.520]   You guys remember the what was it?
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.560]   Then then then then then.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.440]   Yeah, you gotta be careful that one. Yeah, that was.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.880]   Yeah. And so, look, I mean, the data so far looks great with these GLP
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.240]   you know, with one's.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.480]   These drugs seem to be very effective.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.720]   There's some data now that shows as soon as you stop taking it,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.440]   the average person on it gains the weight right back.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.560]   No, that didn't happen for me.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.000]   Increased muscle mass.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.960]   Maybe not, but like, yeah, you know, across a large population,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.080]   there's just data that's showing that there's never going to be an easy path.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.800]   And it's a very difficult.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.720]   It's a process.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.800]   You know, the the thing I learned is if you just have like one Oreo a day
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.040]   or every other day, let's say that's 50 calories.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.320]   You have one of those every other day.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.000]   You're going to gain two pounds a year for 20 years.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.280]   Now you're 40 pounds overweight.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.480]   It happens very slowly.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.640]   You add it and then you just have to be super disciplined
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.920]   and you can lose a half a pound or a pound a week and then it can come off.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.640]   So I really think it should be a movement in the United States.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.440]   So much of our downstream issues, diabetes, heart disease,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.440]   cancer, et cetera, seem to be contributed by obesity.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.400]   So I think for our entire for the entire country,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   I think if I ran for president, it would be what Govy for everybody.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.800]   Everybody, anybody who wants it, there you go.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.160]   Be forever is my platform.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.080]   Single issue voters.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.800]   There's a platform you can. Yeah, that's it.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.280]   Single issue platform.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.760]   All right. Get in shape.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.600]   There's some news I think we could we could touch on.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.640]   How you feeling?
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.040]   Yeah, playing the catch. Let's do this.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.680]   So there was an article in Vice, I guess, that name check.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.840]   The All In podcast has said young people, instead of wanting to become
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.960]   McKinsey consultants, now want to become members of the All In podcast
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.040]   and be venture capitalists.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.360]   I did a little tweet storm that I thought.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.320]   And I thought it'd be a great topic for us.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.760]   I think for young people, going into venture early is not a good idea.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.920]   I think generally speaking, 80 percent of the case cases.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.520]   And I think starting your own company or joining a high growth company
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.760]   or maybe joining a well run large company
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.720]   or even joining a poorly run large company, you learn what not to do
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.440]   are all better things to do in your 20s.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.760]   Learn be in the trenches.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.160]   But I'm curious what you think, Sax, about this issue,
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.400]   because we came to venture and investing in our 40s, I believe.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.200]   You know, both of us, angel investors and then both of us having fun.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.360]   So what are you advising a young person who's listening to the podcast
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.760]   coming out of business school or whatever?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.080]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:03.040]   I think the main value prop that a VC has to offer a founder is advice.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.320]   And if you've never walked in the founder's shoes before,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.400]   if you've never founded a company or at least had a significant operating role,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.120]   how are you in a position to offer them advice?
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.840]   Now, I think there was a period of time during the bull market
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.040]   where people stopped thinking that way, stopped thinking that advice was the model.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.800]   VCs started competing on the basis of who could be the biggest cheerleader
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.560]   for the founder, who could offer the most sort of positive emotional support,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.240]   largest valuation or the biggest valuation or least governance.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   The idea of being completely passive, not taking a board seat
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:42.200]   was actually sold to founders as a positive for them that like will invest
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.840]   and will just like stay completely out of the way.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.920]   And all of those ideas sounded really good when the market was booming
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.280]   and everything was up and to the right.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.200]   But now we're in a situation in which we're going through two years of intense turmoil
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.080]   and a lot of companies aren't going to make it.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.280]   A lot of companies are restructuring.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.040]   A lot of companies are going to take down rounds.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.000]   And actually being able to tap your board for advice
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.040]   on how to get through a rough patch actually is pretty important.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.640]   You realize now that like the uninvolved, passive investor,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.320]   that was not a positive value prop.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.920]   That was an excuse for not having a value prop.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.720]   And I think at times like this, it's really important to have VCs
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.160]   who've been around the block, who saw the last downturn,
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.200]   who ideally could have warned you that it was coming.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.720]   Like we did on this pod repeatedly for a year.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.880]   And so, yeah, I think that we're now seeing the correction.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.720]   And I firmly agree with your analysis that there are too many people
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.240]   who join the ranks of VC who fundamentally didn't have a value prop.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.800]   And that's why I mean, in our firm, we require that everyone
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.840]   who joins the investment team have operating experience and ideally founder
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.400]   experience, because that is ultimately what you're going to offer founders.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.760]   Chamath was too much of this people larping live action role playing VC
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.520]   with just absolutely no idea how this works.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.200]   And now what happens to those, you know, actor VCs
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.400]   who really are faced with portfolios that are upside down
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.160]   and they really have no idea how to weather a storm?
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.040]   This has been a hard 18 months. Let's be honest.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.800]   Well, I think that it was a symptom of just the fact
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.480]   that there was a lot of free money in the system.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.720]   And I don't know the outcome is going to be pretty basic, which is that
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.320]   they're going to lose money for their limited partners.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   And those limited partners, if they're not totally stupid,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.480]   will never give these people money again.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.920]   And these people will need to just find a new job.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.800]   And I don't say that in a celebratory way.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.160]   It's just a very practical ones and zeros monetary assessment of the facts.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.480]   Look, I think that the weird thing that has happened
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   is that it became like this kind of fun thing to be able to say you were doing.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.840]   A lot of people used to moonlight and do it on the side.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.960]   Then there were all these services that allow you to basically like
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.400]   abstract the job.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.640]   But the only thing that I would just qualify your statement,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.680]   because I think what you're saying is like 90 percent right.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.200]   But I don't think that's where the craziest outcome returns have come from,
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.120]   because if you look at the two people that are really or the three people
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.200]   that are really generated, just gargantuan home run returns
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.120]   on a consistent basis, one of them, for example, like Mike Moritz, really
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.880]   didn't have those bona fides operationally.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.440]   But I think that what Mike probably has, and I'm saying this, not knowing him
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.400]   is a preternatural like judge of psychology.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.160]   I think I think he's an incredibly qualified people judger.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.160]   And there are people like that.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.040]   Now, he's an outlier in order to do that.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.000]   But the rest of us have to kind of, to your point, do with what we have,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.880]   which is like, here's our experience and our maturity.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.720]   And, you know, we're telling you what we think.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.880]   So I'm really excited, actually, for this wave to kind of crash on shore,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.800]   because the number of founders that are going to get screwed over by folks
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.840]   that don't know what they're talking about, it's very high.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.640]   Yeah. And that needs to come to an end as quickly as possible.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.080]   Yeah, I don't think it's just like Moritz.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.360]   I think that there's a class of successful venture capitalists.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.040]   Bill Gurley is a great example.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.000]   Like he was an analyst.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Danny Reimer at Index Ventures was an investment analyst.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.720]   Fred Wilson. Fred Wilson.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.040]   Yeah. Lifetime VC.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.000]   And Moritz, John Doerr.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.760]   I mean, John Doerr had some Doerr work at Intel.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.040]   He worked at Intel.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   But there is there are folks who have an incredible analytical capacity
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.160]   and that analytical capacity translates into incredible selection capability.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.480]   That selection doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to necessarily
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.840]   be the best advisors.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.000]   And I'm not saying that any of those folks are bad advisors,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   but there are some venture investors like Founders Fund is very vocal about this
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and very public about this, that their objective is not to be your partner
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.920]   in helping you make decisions and run your company and recruit people
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.520]   and all the other sort of rigmarole that many VCs go out and tout.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.360]   They are there to pick the best founders
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.720]   and the best founders don't need the VC to be successful.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.040]   And their job then is to have incredible selection capacity.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.000]   So if they can select the best founders and get out of their way,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.360]   they've made a lot of money and their returns are unbelievable.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.120]   And then there are some VCs who are really incredible partners
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.200]   to their founders and their objective.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.520]   Josh Koppelman at First Round built an entire firm around this practice,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.960]   which is to partner very closely with founders and to build support
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.720]   and capabilities.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.080]   Andresen Horowitz was built on the same sort of concept
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.280]   that they would that they would roll all of their fees into building,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.680]   operating support and capacity to support founders and support companies.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.120]   Both firms have obviously done well in their own right.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.160]   And so I don't know if there's necessarily one breed that predicts success
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.320]   when it comes to successful venture capital.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.040]   I will say from my own personal experience,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.760]   I worked as an investment banker for my first two years out of undergrad.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.720]   I, you know, worked. I had a science background.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.840]   I worked in a short stint in private equity.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.080]   I worked at Google. I did Corp Dev and M&A there.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.600]   I started a company, ran it, sold it,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.440]   did that with another business where I was on the board.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   So, you know, I've I've been on a couple of different places around the table
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   that, you know, I think have given me the ability to to provide advice.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.920]   I don't know if I necessarily have the same skill set that the team
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.080]   at Founders Fund and Mike Moritz and others might have at this astute,
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.320]   extraordinary ability to spot founders and bring them in.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.760]   So I think everyone needs to kind of recognize what they do bring to the table,
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.760]   be very clear about what that is.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.080]   And I think to your point,
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.120]   there has just been an incredible bull market over the last 15 years,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   since 2008. More money has.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.760]   I heard an incredible statistic, by the way.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.720]   I don't want to get it wrong.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.080]   So maybe we should fact check me after this from someone at your wedding
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.320]   who I was talking to for a long time.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.960]   And he was like, he was like, basically, the top one percent of VCs
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.840]   didn't beat what would have happened if you just bought the top five
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.440]   public tech companies and, you know, effectively did a rebalance
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.240]   over the past 15 years.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.000]   The bull market and the the aggregation of value in technology
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.480]   has largely been 50/50 to public and private.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.080]   So you could have just bought a few stocks and held on to them
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.360]   and beat all of the VCs over the last 15 years,
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.320]   even though a bunch of VCs have made good money in their IRR looks like 12 percent.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.440]   But you have to beat the risk adjusted returns on venture.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   And this is not to throw shade at even all of those people
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.320]   that you mentioned are fucking terrible, right?
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.120]   Like you should not have invested in any of those, right?
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.560]   Because there's no way to turn it in any of those funds
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.280]   because you get a small allocation.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.040]   One fund does well, three funds do crappy.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.920]   Over the past 10 years or 15 years, I forgot the number.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.160]   We've seen the public market cap of these top tech companies
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.520]   grow from one trillion to 10 trillion.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.240]   That's a 10X.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.440]   So all you had to do was buy those and you would have made 10X.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.800]   And that works out to north of 25 percent IRR.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.200]   Yeah. And there's very few VCs that have been able to be 25 percent IRR.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.920]   They assume now he was telling me his model shows that over the next 10 years,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.240]   it'll be roughly 70/30.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.840]   So it'll be about 30 percent more accrued.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.240]   And they think over the next 10 years, it's going to go from 10 trillion
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.840]   to 25 trillion, which is still a great return.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.000]   Just to build on it shows how much of a hurdle there is in venture to be successful.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.680]   I started the business in 2011.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.840]   So now this is the 12th or 13th year.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.640]   Just how hard this game is.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.920]   I had about a 31, 32 percent gross IRR
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.480]   going into last year, and then my IRR fell off a cliff
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.240]   because I couldn't get into obviously there's like there's no money to distribute.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.200]   Well, there's nothing to distribute.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.480]   So my IRR start to decay.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.440]   And then I had this really, really fucked up choice.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.320]   I have to start selling stuff earlier than I would have otherwise
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.600]   to get the money back out. So to your point, right now, it takes courage.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.800]   Then it's a really tough game over a long period of time.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.680]   Yeah, a really tough game.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.160]   I think there's also something going on, you know, in the United States
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.280]   and society where there are some idealized jobs.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.840]   We talked about sacks, elites, surplus elites.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.560]   And I want to dovetail this with what's happening in Hollywood.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.360]   The writers strike and the actors strike.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.680]   And I was looking at it.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.800]   There's some unbelievable number of actors in sacks,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.400]   some unbelievable number of writers.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.320]   They all make just incredibly small amounts of money on average.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.480]   And obviously there's some big fish who do well.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.800]   But it does seem like
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.320]   there's too many people who want too many of these idealized jobs.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.560]   And venture is one of those.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.440]   And I just would like young people to understand.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.560]   Also, be careful what you wish for.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.360]   This job has seemed easy, just like it might seem easy for Tom Cruise
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.480]   or Christopher Nolan when you see them or Tarantino.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.000]   What you don't see is all of the people who tried to become Tarantino,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.840]   who tried to become, you know, Tom Cruise.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.520]   And there are far too ten to 15 years before they realize that they're not.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   And they did not actually have the fundamental skills
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.400]   or the work ethic that is required to become Tarantino.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.080]   I listen to Tarantino's podcast.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.560]   He does a have you heard the Video Archives podcast yet?
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.120]   You have to get on this.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.040]   It's him and his the co-writer of who did you write Pulp Fiction with?
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.880]   Roger Avery.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.080]   Roger him and Roger Avery is my favorite podcast right now.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.760]   They just talk about films.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.400]   Their knowledge of films is so unbelievable.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.760]   And the detail in which they talk about that is so crisp.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.960]   They finish each other's sentences in the way with maybe you listen
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.120]   to this podcast, you know, we all go, Oh, John Doerr.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.080]   Oh, no, he worked at Intel.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.560]   Oh, this person. Yeah, Meritz. He was a journalist.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.600]   We have a deep, deep understanding of this business
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.760]   that comes from 30 years within it or 20 years.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.200]   And I think you have to I know it sounds corny, but you have to pay your dues.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.360]   You have to put 60, 70 hours in a week to get that elite job.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   And the problem today, I feel, is and for people who are listening
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.920]   or young people coming out of schools, if you're not willing to sacrifice
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.760]   60, 70, 80 hours a week for a decade or two,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.360]   you're just not going to be successful in that.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.800]   By the way, and young people push back on this.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.440]   And I think the simplest way to reframe it is in the following.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.520]   Do you really think, for example, let's pick NBA basketball.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.440]   Do you think you would be really interested or find credible
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.760]   that the best player in the NBA only practiced three hours a week?
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.640]   Does that happen?
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:10.960]   Impossible.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.000]   Or do you think they're practicing three hours in the morning
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.640]   and then also three hours in the afternoon and they give up their lives?
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.200]   The most incredible thing that I saw in the NBA was all of these men
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.440]   literally gave up their life to play that game, to perfect it.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.360]   And that's true for anything.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.080]   And so I don't understand how, whether if you're a filmmaker,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.520]   whether you want to be an investor, whether you want to be an athlete,
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.600]   whether you want to be an actor, a surgeon.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.160]   It's just like it's an immutable law of physics.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   So just get over it, which is you need to put in tens of thousands of hours.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.400]   And if you cannot or won't,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.560]   you should not expect the success and you should not complain.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.760]   And also because it's not free.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.920]   Yeah, these these guys agree with that or not.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.840]   Yeah, look, I mean, LeBron 20.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.120]   What was it, 2016, when they came back and won in game seven?
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.000]   Twenty sixteen.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.120]   Yeah, I don't want to talk about scar tissue.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.920]   Right. But the next day, they were, you know, his teammates go out and celebrate.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.400]   You know, LeBron did on Instagram the next day, posted a photo at 7 a.m.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.040]   of Ron was working out. Yeah, working out.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.720]   But look, one thing I'll say, LeBron knows what his skill is
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.360]   and he knows what his game is.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.200]   I think every individual needs to figure out what their skill is
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.600]   and what their game is and not to find glory
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.400]   in what others have found to be their skill and their game,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.680]   that there is something that comes from mastering any craft
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.080]   that gives an individual joy and purpose in life.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.960]   And you see this in basketball.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.560]   You see it when these athletes really find what they love and they do it
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.880]   and they commit to it.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.320]   And there are things that we each have realized we are good at.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.840]   And there are things that we've all certainly realized we are not good at.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.640]   And identifying that and mastering one's craft is the key to any person
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.480]   being successful and happy, I believe.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.520]   I just just just assuming that there's a thing out there
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.320]   that everyone makes money.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.080]   Distraction alert. All of our wives are about to go swimming.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.000]   Oh, my God. They're so hot.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.800]   My good God. Look at my wife.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.560]   Whoo.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.120]   Jesus.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.280]   God almighty. I hit the jackpot.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.240]   Beauty and the beast.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.880]   You can relate to my
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.600]   what way I look at it.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.240]   We were joking at breakfast today.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.960]   We were like, my wife must have low self-esteem because she's married to me.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.440]   Saksa, the best slide.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.200]   He's like, if you Google Natalie, don't pay.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.040]   You find this picture of her holding a tiger, a lion by the tail,
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.880]   which is a lot more exciting than holding a Sri Lankan by the schlong.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.400]   Hey, oh, hey, oh,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   I was playing at the man for sacks when he did the roast last night.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.680]   I was just like laughing guy every time he hit it.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.960]   I just went back to the table.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.600]   You didn't get help me off the cliff.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   I was waiting for that.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.240]   More help. Help me all the way off the cliff.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.360]   I mean, I think he knows how you know what happened.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.680]   Kat told me what happened.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.320]   So the back story is Phil Hamuth is a narcissist.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.080]   And if you know Phil Hamuth, you know that. Yeah, that's implied.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.800]   And he just cannot give a speech.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.000]   And so, best friend, we all he's not my best friend.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.800]   Spike, that is going to be really upset.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.200]   But he's he he gives horrible speeches.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.680]   He you and he are best friends.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.720]   Like every every speech.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.960]   Phil, every speech he gives at every event, it's all about himself.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.680]   It's all about himself.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.520]   That's why we say seven seconds to fail.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.480]   But it's incredible because it could be goes off the road.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.000]   It could be a wedding or bar mitzvah.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.680]   A funeral. It doesn't matter.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.720]   But in our chat.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.240]   So when when Jamal said, OK, Phil's going to give a speech,
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.840]   Phil's like, of course, I'm going to give a speech.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.320]   Every but I give is amazing.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.680]   I tell him every time I bring $70 million.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.880]   Then he goes, the last event I gave a speech.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.040]   It brought the house down.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.920]   Everyone was laughing.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.280]   I killed it.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.040]   It was Doyle Brunson's funeral.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.120]   Oh, my God. No, dude.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.600]   What? What? You killed it at a funeral.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.360]   So I asked I asked how you to do to do this toast.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.400]   And I was like, OK, well, we'll do four of them.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.120]   But I thought if we start with how it'll just be so bad.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.360]   Yeah. You bought him out early.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.360]   Yeah. You bought him out early.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.680]   And the rest of you guys set the bar.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.720]   Yeah. But Saks crushed it.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.280]   Saks nailed it. Saks crushed it.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.960]   Deep State crushed it. Deep State crushed it.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.520]   I think we're all still amazed that made up the stairs.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.360]   You know, it was it was all right.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.120]   I was 400 steps to that.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   Yeah, it looks good.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.280]   He wasn't even out of breath.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.440]   It was pretty impressive.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.480]   Yeah. This has been a great episode of the Olin pod.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.840]   Did anybody see Oppenheimer yet?
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.000]   I'm so excited.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.760]   I don't see it.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.960]   It's going to be a Barbenheimer double feature.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.160]   Barbenheimer.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.560]   In honor of the Barbenheimer wedding.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.600]   Yeah, I'm not. I'm not Barbenheimer-ing it.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.920]   I'm good. I've seen it in IMAX.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.680]   I think Nolan's like so about 70 millimeter prints.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.600]   He's like, you have to watch it.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.520]   Do you know the Metreon?
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.120]   In the city.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.520]   Is it? So we should just rent the theater and invite some fans.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.000]   Or just go. Yeah, I mean, we should do that.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.560]   No, we should rent it. Let's rent it.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.800]   This week. I've rented it.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.160]   It's I think it's sold out until like six.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.880]   Very limited time. Oh, the theater is.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.480]   We just have to call them and say, hey, can we rent the thing?
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.920]   They'll do a show. Here's 20 dimes.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.560]   I once went to a showing of Interstellar there.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.200]   And Christopher Nolan came and spoke and got to meet him and speak to him afterwards.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.120]   He's a very soft spoken guy and he's not very sociable.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.760]   He doesn't, you know, sort of like Saks.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.960]   He doesn't want to make eye contact and actually talk with you.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.240]   But, you know, we challenged him.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.320]   Are you making fun of people with Asperger's?
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.640]   But he was great. I mean, I know.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.840]   Pot, it's kettle calling.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.800]   I will say he's what?
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.120]   Top three filmmakers of our time. Top four.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.720]   There is for me, it's Ridley Scott, Tarantino, Nolan.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.160]   There's a very funny.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.200]   Where's your list, Saks, right now?
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.280]   You got to put Scorsese on that list. Oh, right. Of course.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.040]   P.T. Anderson. No, no.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.320]   P.T. Anderson. Dennis Villanueva.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.360]   Hit or miss. Woody Allen.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.440]   Can we mention that name?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.000]   I mean, I can't say that bleep.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.800]   It's hard to watch now. It's hard to watch.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.720]   The whole Sunni thing makes it too hard.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.400]   I like.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:54.720]   No, Nick, Nick, bleep those out.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.040]   There's a very funny moment on the the first the first dinner.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.320]   Yeah. You know, we did this great thing.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.040]   You can make people the names when sat down.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.640]   Everybody's like, and I was waiting for David to sit. Yeah.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.000]   And he just keep talking and talking, talking and talking.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.400]   And finally, not when you like sit the fuck down right now
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.280]   and had to get this fucking thing going.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.160]   So who do you got? You got Scorsese, of course.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.120]   Yeah. I mean, you're talking about like currently alive filmmakers.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.800]   I think that active filmmakers, unless you mentioned is pretty good.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.120]   I have to think about it for missing anybody.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.080]   Yeah. Really, Scott's up there for you.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.200]   Yeah. Yeah. Really, Scott. Yeah.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.280]   I mean, he's still making Christopher Nolan is pretty excellent.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.600]   He's very productive, too.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.360]   That's the thing about every two years.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.800]   Michael Bay versatility.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   Michael Bay. I don't know if really Scott's been number one, but
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.680]   I met Michael Bay in Costa Rica.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.960]   Can you get that beginning of the story?
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.680]   That's all I got. Can you did you ask for the thirty dollars back?
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.880]   For Transformers?
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.000]   No, I mean, I didn't particularly know who you like.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.480]   Can I watch any of this?
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.680]   I cannot watch any of those. Yeah, it's a very nice guy.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.840]   I don't know. Sure. He's great.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.640]   So also, he's got Napoleon coming out.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.200]   The trailer looks amazing. Amazing.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.320]   Anything with walking Michael Bay is making.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.360]   Really, Scott. Oh, really?
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.440]   Scott, walking Phoenix playing Napoleon.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.320]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.600]   I hate to go deep into the do you guys want to talk about Zert bad behavior
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.040]   or you want to talk about the resolution of this Hollywood stuff
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.800]   and what it means writ large?
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.560]   Well, the Hollywood stuff, I think it's fascinating.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.160]   I tweeted about this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   My observations on this were twofold.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.480]   One is that it's going to have the exact opposite effect that they want.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.000]   If what they want is what the writers and the Actors Guild want
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.720]   is to show the owners of the studios how valuable they are.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.840]   The problem is that this moves the owners
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   and the studios one step closer into the hands of tools
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.000]   that will disintermediate the actors and the writers.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.840]   They'll embrace that technology.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.280]   They'll embrace the AI tools that you guys have talked about.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.520]   You were showing something around even like yesterday or whatever.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.200]   So like the point is, like, I don't see it as very effective.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:06.600]   And then my second thought is like, I just think unions in general
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.720]   are probably not a very effective way to get these concessions anymore
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.880]   versus the tax that the union members pay.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.520]   And you can just see that in terms of like the number of people
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.960]   in unions are just kind of decaying pretty quickly.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.000]   The wage gains are pretty de minimis.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.600]   It's just not an effective mechanism of negotiation.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.200]   Sax, the unions are a way for average
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.880]   performers to fight to get a little bit more.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.160]   But it's the antithesis of having a meritocracy
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.280]   and people fighting for their best possible pay.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.440]   And so the conundrum I have is I'm seeing all these Marvel actors,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.360]   superhero actors getting dropped off at the protests,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.440]   and they're complaining about Bob Iger making 25 million
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.280]   when Tom Cruise or, you know, Robert Downey Jr.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.720]   Pick the person. I'm not singling anybody out.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.080]   But those people who got to the top of the heap after 20, 30,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.920]   40 years in the business are getting paid 50 million a picture,
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.360]   100 million a picture of back ends.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.720]   And so what's your take on what's going on here?
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.680]   Because it seems I don't want to say hypocritical, but it feels like
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.200]   they're talking out of both sides of their mouth.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.720]   They want to have an auction to the highest bidder
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.040]   for these incredibly talented writers, directors, producers, as it should be.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.280]   But then they also want to fight for the average. Right.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   It's confusing to me.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.400]   Some of the union demands, I think, are reasonable,
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.680]   and I understand why they want them.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.160]   So, for example, I think they're arguing for more residuals
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.600]   for, like you said, the kind of lower level performers
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.200]   so that they can get health care.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.280]   The average ones. Yeah.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.000]   So I can understand that.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.960]   At the same time, they're demanding that writers' rooms
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.600]   not use software, which they're already doing.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.880]   Yeah. Which is just crazy because I is going to be incorporated
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.760]   into all software.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:56.160]   So to not be able to use the latest features of whatever word or Google
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.280]   docs or whatever screenwriting software. Yes.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.360]   That's like the king who ordered the tides to stop.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.120]   You know, this is a march of technology. It's not going to work.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   So I think that's like really off base.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.920]   So I can sympathize with some of the demands.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.960]   Other ones, I think, are hard to see in terms of your point about the economics.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.440]   I mean, look, the basic problem with Hollywood is
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.040]   it's a winner take all business.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.840]   I mean, you've got a few actors who become big stars.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.200]   This is true, actually, with all the creative industries
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.080]   is their power law businesses.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.920]   You know, J.K.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.160]   Rowling makes a billion dollars as an author.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.200]   The 10,000 author or whatever makes almost fantasy.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.320]   Yeah. First, it makes a living. Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.400]   They're living in a month.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.320]   Yeah. Can't even make a living.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.000]   And the reason for that, by the way, is because there's a lot of people
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.560]   willing to do it for free.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.040]   Humans are fundamentally creative.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.800]   There's a lot of people willing to be actors for free or sure.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.560]   On a social or writers or write or whatever creatively
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.200]   because they're willing to do their art for free podcasters. Right.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.320]   And so the reality is the reason Hollywood doesn't have to pay
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.880]   these sort of the entry level actors very much is there's a lot of people
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.640]   willing to do that job.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.400]   There's too many people.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.480]   A lot of people want to do that.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.600]   And it doesn't need to be in a structured production system anymore.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.880]   I you guys saw the latest Disney earnings release.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.720]   And Iger said, we are going to consider selling that
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.560]   geo and a bunch of other channels.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.920]   There may actually be a spin off because content creation
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.600]   for that mid tier or that tail no longer makes it viable, profitable
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.240]   because there's so much content being generated by this very long tail
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.880]   that's accruing a lot of the eyeballs and a lot of the hours
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.520]   of consumers mindset and time.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.920]   I think that there's a big just to connect that idea.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.320]   So we were talking earlier about career choices.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.240]   So first of all, it's I agree with what you guys said about the time
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.960]   that you have to make, but it's not really about time per se.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.480]   It's about your obsession level.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.200]   Can you be obsessed with something so that 60, 70 hours a week
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.640]   feels like nothing to you because you're so immersed, you're so obsessed with it.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:51.920]   Right.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.880]   The way that Tarantino and Avery are obsessed with classic films
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.320]   have the whole database in their head.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.760]   So if you want to pursue one of these careers in a winner take all space
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.720]   like writing, like acting or whatever, you better just be completely upset.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.320]   You got to be all in.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.680]   Yeah, you got to be all in.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   I'd say furthermore, and be unique.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.000]   Like what makes you novel?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.480]   Yeah, I mean, even if you are all in, you still have to have luck and skill.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.720]   And yeah, and furthermore, you have to know where the bar is.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.000]   So I think a lot of people, this is one of the things I noticed
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.880]   when I was producing a movie is a lot of people look at like the worst actor
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.120]   or the worst screenwriter and say, I'm better than that person.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.600]   So I'm going to make it.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.400]   But your bar is not the worst person who's made it.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.960]   Your bar is the best person who hasn't made it.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.240]   That's the person you're really competing against.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.000]   Next up.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.760]   It's the next up.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.960]   It's the person you're going on auditions and you're competing against
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   someone who hasn't made it yet, but they're amazing.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.160]   And you don't necessarily know where that bar is because it's much harder to see.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.000]   Yeah, but that's where the bar really is.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.720]   Right. Look, I think there's also a big disruption.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.560]   That's really well said.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.720]   Yeah, totally.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.480]   And as we extend the long tail of consumer content creation
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.000]   into what is effectively now the infinite tail of AI generation,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.400]   AI generated content creation, it is going to totally disrupt
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   and change the game of media, of content.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.280]   Generally speaking, we're getting to a point now where you can effectively tie
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.640]   together rendering engines with scripting, with scene definition,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.880]   with directorial lines, all the stuff that goes into pre-production
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.320]   and production can be generated through through AI, through scripting
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.840]   and then tuned and tweaked by a human.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.160]   But ultimately, it increases the scale like all technologies do.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.880]   It increases leverage for humans.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.640]   And we could see 100 times more films come out, each of which costs one
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.840]   one hundredth the cost.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.800]   You know, one of the best production companies in L.A.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.440]   is Blumhouse.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.640]   You know, they make horror films for two million dollars.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.240]   They make them for two million bucks and they make a bunch of them
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.880]   because they cost so little to make.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.880]   And if any one of them hits, they make one hundred eighty million bucks
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.240]   or two hundred million bucks at the box office.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.280]   It's a fantastic business.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.040]   Genre films.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.160]   It's very much a unique model in Hollywood, and it's really changed
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.280]   the game quite a bit.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.200]   And I think we're going to see something similar emerge
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.080]   because of generative AI and the tooling.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.640]   And then people start to question what is it called?
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   What is it called?
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:08.600]   But look, one thing I do want to say, I do think that there's also a change
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.440]   in Hollywood that's going to be driven, as we talked about before,
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.040]   by the ability to generate personalized film, personalized content
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.120]   rather than one piece of content for everyone where you have to make blockbusters
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.400]   and everyone watches it.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.280]   There is a question, however, of culture and culture is,
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.680]   you know, shared experience, stories and beliefs, shared experience,
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.160]   stories and beliefs can still be realized through personalized media,
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.800]   through personalized content generation.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.840]   Think about, you know, an old narrative, an old tale that was told,
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.000]   you know, via people speaking to each other around a campfire.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.640]   The ethics and the morals of the story are still there,
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.480]   but everyone tells it a little bit differently.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.680]   I think that's what we may end up seeing Hollywood production
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.120]   or AI generated production.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.480]   You guys see, which is everyone tweaks their content in their own personal way.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.960]   They consume it in their own way.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.960]   But the Hollywood studios, how much of a role do they ultimately end up playing?
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.920]   And does this start to go ten times more what we've seen in YouTube
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.120]   content consumption goes way up.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.840]   And the number of folks that are contributing to it goes way up by ten or 100.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.040]   I think this is one of the fundamental things that the unions and Hollywood
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.440]   have not yet grokked completely, which is they're not fighting each other.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.680]   They're fighting TikTok, YouTube podcasts and people making their own content.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.960]   That's they're fighting.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.160]   You know, they know they're fighting Jimmy Donaldson.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:23.800]   They're fighting Mr.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.920]   B, Mr. B. They're fighting each other over the last scrap.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.720]   I think the dark horse. Exactly.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.040]   And I think they need to get inside.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.040]   They're fighting the people that spend two hours a week
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.800]   listening to us rant on about stuff, right?
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.440]   Like they're fighting.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.920]   Well, that's two less hours.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.560]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.800]   It's two less hours of broadcast TV.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.480]   And then Mr.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.240]   Beast, these kids watch his videos five times.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:42.800]   They watch it.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.280]   You know, by the way, he's probably the only person in recent memory
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.800]   that has rebuilt event based viewership
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.720]   because people know Saturday mornings at noon Eastern time.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.760]   That's when these videos drop hundreds of millions of people.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.600]   It's appointment television.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.040]   It's appointment television.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.520]   Now, back, by the way, when you hear, you know, the story about Mr.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.080]   Beast, that's a guy that's been doing it since he was 13 years old studying.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.240]   He's 24 years old.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.760]   So that's 11 years where he's literally only lived and breathed.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.720]   High energy.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.040]   And in the lab, high energy iteration in the lab down to the very pixel.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.720]   Right. Like when he, for example, like the cuts, remember,
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.000]   remember his cuts on his video?
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.800]   Remember he told us about like thumbnails.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.160]   He has an entire PhD thesis that he's learned just on thumbnails.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.800]   Yeah, right. And that's a level of commit.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.280]   I think what Hollywood needs to do just to put it out there is
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.000]   that the leadership in Hollywood gets compensated on a corporate level.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.280]   And then they come up with this, you know, pay and sometimes residual,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.720]   sometimes not, and scraps for the talent.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:46.840]   I would encourage them to read something like an autobiography by Kurosawa
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:51.040]   and study the Toho system where everybody was aligned inside the company.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.400]   If I'm running Disney, I'm hiring the top two or 300 writers,
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.640]   putting them full time on staff, giving them equity
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.840]   and getting everybody rowing in the right direction.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.720]   They do not have time to fuck around.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.240]   They need to be in alignment, making great content.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.520]   But the incentive structure matters.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.440]   If Bob Iger is getting compensated by stock options, the actors,
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.000]   Robert Downey Jr., who's the guy, the incredible director of Swingers and
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.320]   Favreau, Favreau, I was talking to Favreau at an event and I was like,
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.040]   how much like equity in Disney did you get for doing Mandalorian
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.880]   and like launching Disney Plus for them?
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.280]   And he's like, zero, zero.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.040]   By the way, why do you know if you look back up one hundred million dollars?
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.720]   If you know, but if you look and this is what's crazy.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   If you look at the biggest content producers of that older generation,
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.400]   they locked up the equity.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.880]   You know, Spielberg owns equity in the movies that he made.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.560]   George Lucas owns equity in the movie.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.960]   He owned part of the studios.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.200]   The deal Christopher Nolan cut on on Oppenheimer.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.560]   No, I think he gets 20 percent of the gross off the first dollar.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.440]   That's absurd.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.600]   Yeah. And he got a hundred million dollar budget and a hundred million
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.560]   marketing commit on the on the deal.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.680]   A Joker was Todd Phillips.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.200]   Well, there's a perfect example.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.040]   I was talking to Todd Phillips, actually.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.720]   I got to have dinner with him last summer. Great guy. Yeah.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.880]   Yeah. Great guy.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:10.160]   And he waived his fee on Joker to take a big chunk of the equity
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.640]   because Todd Phillips is very bad on the Hangover.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.520]   And he owned the IP of the Hangover.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.320]   He owned the sequels and Hangover one and two.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.040]   Amazing Hangover three.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.080]   And you can miss it.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.560]   Yeah. But he made more.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.280]   I think on Hangover three. Yeah.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.880]   And he got all those guys, Galifianakis, et cetera.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.240]   They got their biggest payday on number three. Right.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.120]   You have to craft a deal. We have equity.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.320]   The other crazy video, the studio was less bullish than he was on both Hangover
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   and Joker, because they were both shows you how unusual movies.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.080]   So they allowed him to take equity in exchange for giving back.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.040]   They're like, you only want to spend 50 million on a superhero film.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.000]   That's never going to work.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And then he's like, yeah, it made a billion.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.400]   Joker made a billion.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.120]   Right. They thought it was too dark.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.840]   Underestimating audiences, as always in Hollywood.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.520]   I'll tell you a very funny poker story.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.600]   Are you going to keep your Disney stock?
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.920]   Right now, I'm going to ride it out.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.080]   I think their IP collection is amazing.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:06.000]   I think there's a chance that, you know, depending on how the FTC winds up
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.400]   being run over the long term, that Disney could be selling pieces of that business.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.440]   And I think that it could become an acquisition target itself at some point.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.800]   You want to hear a Todd Phillips poker story?
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.560]   I play a part with him. Yeah, he's he's fun.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.840]   Phillips is a very, very disciplined poker player.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.640]   You know, he's got like a stop loss.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.440]   He hits the stop loss. He's done.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.880]   And he's very funny and jokes around, you know, bus balls, whatever.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.120]   And there was a while where he would play in the big game in L.A. with us.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.760]   And he didn't say much.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.840]   He was very focused and tight is right.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.640]   And then he did this deal and then Hangover three comes out.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.240]   And all of a sudden, you know, he's got chirping chips.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.280]   He's splashing the pot.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.960]   I bust Phillips in a pot and he looks at me
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.200]   and he called me slumdog billionaire.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.480]   And the guys at the table thought it was so funny
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.800]   because that movie Slumdog Millionaire had just come out.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.440]   So then they all started calling me slummy.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   Slumdog, it took me a year for them to get.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.240]   Stop calling me that. Yeah, pretty great.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.560]   On the union thing, I'll tell you a story.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.320]   So recently it was just announced that Anchor Steam shut down.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.480]   Anchor Steam was this beer, this native beer in San Francisco
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.680]   that's been around forever.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.040]   Japanese brewery bought them, right?
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.240]   It was bought by Sapporo several years ago.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.560]   Anchor Steam shut down.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.040]   Anchor Steam shut down. Yeah.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.880]   I used to go there all the time for like work events.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.040]   You do like an offsite there and go to the brewery.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.600]   It's yeah, it was like one of the original.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.560]   I don't know.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.360]   Yeah, I kind of winning beer.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.600]   I can't wait. Well, it's out of business now.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   And the reason is, well, it was losing money.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.120]   And you want to know why is because three years ago,
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.320]   the workers all voted to unionize.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.280]   There were only something like 60 workers, 62 workers.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.320]   And three years ago, they vote to unionize and they voted themselves.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.840]   Big pay increases. Yeah.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.720]   And so I guess the poor had to go along with it.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.400]   Three years later, it's like, yeah, shut the whole thing down.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.720]   I think that's and that's and that's the thing is you got to be careful
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.040]   what you wish for. This is overplay.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.640]   I really think the thing with unions that they get wrong
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.840]   is unions fight for exactly this, which is this short term
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.240]   increase in current compensation.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.440]   And I think what unions do very poorly
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.440]   is actually understanding the long term equity that the employees
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.520]   and members of that union actually create.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.200]   I tweeted this a few weeks ago as well.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.320]   But the single biggest reason
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.520]   that motivated me when I sold my piece of the Warriors
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.760]   was obviously just a crazy increase in the valuation.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.520]   Right. I bought it for, you know, three hundred, six, three hundred.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.560]   And it was worth five point two billion at the time.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.040]   But the second biggest reason was my huge fear
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.280]   was that I as an owner, I just wanted to cash in the chips
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.800]   because I think the most right thing to do for the union,
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.880]   like the NBA Players Association, is to fight for equity. Yeah.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.280]   Like Michael Jordan single handedly has created
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.480]   15 billion dollars of equity in the NBA.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.240]   Yeah. How much has he captured?
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.440]   One or two billion, but not from the league.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.520]   He captured it accidentally from shoes. Right.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.360]   How much money is LeBron James actually created for the NBA?
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.080]   It's enormous. Yeah.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.400]   How much is he? He made.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.880]   They're not trying to get the right piece.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.080]   They're not trying to get the right.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.240]   Also, when the business doesn't do well, then the labor contracts
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.680]   become a source of huge inflexibility, huge inflexibility.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.120]   You can't make the necessary business changes.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.840]   So it's your point. The business gets shut down.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.040]   So to your point, like when you when what happens now is there's
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.600]   these huge luxury taxes in professional sports.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.360]   And so folks bloat the payroll.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.600]   They try to get all these players.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.920]   But if you don't win and get to the playoffs, you're not selling more merch.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.320]   You're not getting incremental share of TV revenues.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.480]   You're not getting ticket revenues.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.040]   And all of a sudden you have these massive luxury taxes
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.320]   you have to pay and not enough revenue to pay for it.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.960]   And so these teams all of a sudden now start to gush.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:54.200]   Money have to make capital calls because these things that sound incredible
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.840]   up front start to become real weights on these businesses.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.160]   The real thing, all unions in all industries, I would I would tell you all
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.840]   to do is figure out how to get the equity upside in the business
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.280]   in which your members are working in and are creating value.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.960]   Right. And in exchange for that, have more forgiveness on the downside.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.360]   So the business is actually persevering.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.520]   Whether the storm is supposed to have to shut down.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.160]   Exactly. Alignment, you know, align the incentives are just so critical.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.920]   I was talking to the head of one of the giant publishers.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.520]   I wouldn't say which one.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.000]   Ibnus Business Insider.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.280]   I don't know which one it was, but
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.200]   they were being unionized.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.600]   And I said, wow, is this a disaster for your business?
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   He said, Jake, greatest thing ever.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.440]   I said, why?
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.600]   He's like, now when people come to us and they want to get paid more,
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.080]   we just take out the chart.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.480]   How many years have you been here?
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.840]   Oh, five. OK, yeah.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.880]   One, two, three, four, five, seventy two thousand.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.360]   And there's a well, no, but I bring more pages or whatever.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.720]   It's like, yeah, OK, a page view multiplier point one five.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.520]   OK, so you're seventy eight.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.440]   And just basically that's what happens at Business Insider.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.520]   Yeah, but that's kind of who knows why.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.080]   Why they're a clickbait business is what drives perverse incentives.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.680]   And it's like, why not align it with what is the profitability of the business?
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.480]   What is the growth of the business?
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.280]   A bonus pool, a base level of pay.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.880]   And if the unions are coming in,
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.320]   they are literally rearranging the chairs on the Titanic.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.000]   And it's that simple.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.240]   You if you both the beer industry and Hollywood are both shrinking industries.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.800]   And so when you got unions demanding more, more, more of a shrinking pie,
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.840]   something's going to break.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.240]   Now, look, just to be clear, I'm in favor of unions
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:32.120]   demanding things like better working conditions and health care
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.920]   and just like the basics. Yeah.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.520]   But, you know, when they try to go for things like, I don't know, banning AI
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:43.400]   and weird proposals that distort the cost structure of the business
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.800]   to the point where it's just not feasible, it's not profitable.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.640]   That doesn't work.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.720]   Also, the question is, why call workers who can move so freely between jobs?
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.040]   Yeah, so elite.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:58.560]   Why would any white collar worker who is learning and sharpening their blade
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.760]   and increasing their value year after year?
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.200]   Why would they even want to join a union?
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.000]   There was a podcast union that started in Spotify and Gimlet Media,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.680]   all of this stuff.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.240]   And one of the podcasts, I think it was reply all.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.720]   They didn't want to join the union because they're like, well,
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.040]   we're overcompensated. We're a hit show.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.560]   And then they were all claimed that they were.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.760]   Look at what's happening in the schools.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.920]   But can we steal now?
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.760]   You can't get rid of a bad teacher because they're in the union.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.960]   So it's like a huge proceeding.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.520]   So they put them in a building where the incompetent teachers
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.960]   can we have to be a steel man?
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.280]   The pro case of joining a union in 2023.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.920]   I mean, if you could get how do you feel about benefits
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.680]   like some basic level of benefits?
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.400]   Freeberg.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:44.040]   Look, I think that the pitch and Jake, this is why I asked you this
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.920]   a few episodes ago, you know, tell us your experience
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.880]   having grown up in a family that I think unions are pretty proliferate in these
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.520]   cops, firemen, cops, firemen.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.960]   Yeah, I mean, if you are the pitch is you're you're part of a membership.
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.320]   You have a voice and that voice always is your advocate.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   And that that advocate looks out for benefits, comp, time off,
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.360]   whether or not and how you get fired, all the things that you feel
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.120]   you may be unfairly treated by management.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.280]   There's nothing novel here.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.360]   I don't know. It's a strong, appealing point.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.840]   Yeah. So I don't know if that's the best steel man for it, because look,
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.680]   it's a competitive labor market if you have skills that companies want.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.040]   So you should be able to negotiate for a lot of these things yourself.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.120]   I think the steel man case for unions and the reason why they formed
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.160]   in the first place is because American industry was basically owned
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.840]   by an oligopoly. They were themselves monopolies.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.600]   So if you have a monopoly of industries like U.S.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.120]   Steel or Standard Oil, then there's not a competitive labor market.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.040]   They just set the prices. They set the conditions.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.320]   That's why the unions got started is you needed a basically monopoly
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.320]   of labor to face off against a monopoly of business.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.000]   That's how it got started.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.040]   And I think in those conditions, we're talking about the early 1900s.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.120]   People were losing limbs in factories.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.200]   Yeah, of course. It was very different working conditions.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:00.960]   Different working conditions.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.160]   But now you're talking about much more competitive industries.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.800]   But look, yeah, there was a great deal of manual labor
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.640]   needed to get productivity out of businesses and enterprise.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.680]   So, you know, so much of industry changed where things became automated,
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.720]   where there became specialization and differentiation amongst the workforce.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.320]   And it wasn't everyone is just using their arms to do things.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.680]   And, you know, this is obviously now measurable.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.720]   And the idea that you can basically,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.240]   you know, capture management or do a hostile takeover
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.520]   of the corporation or the equity, I think is effectively
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.600]   what's happened with a lot of these these these.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.160]   And I'll be honest, knowing what I know about unions,
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.880]   if you were to do a deep dive into, you know, the police unions
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.080]   or the firefighter unions or the sanitation unions or the teacher unions
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.640]   and you look at their pensions and their overtime,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.320]   you would see some pretty significant abuse that the unions have built up
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.080]   over years to where people can make three or four hundred thousand dollars a year.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.560]   In the last two or three years, they goose that up
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.920]   because then they base their pension on the average of the last three years.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   And what basically happens is all the senior guys say, listen,
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.320]   all overtime goes to these three guys who are retiring in three years.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.720]   And none of the junior guys can take any overtime.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.840]   And when it's your turn, right, you get all that.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.560]   And then we're going to goosh your pay.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.280]   So what that does unreasonably is the pension calculation,
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.120]   the pay into the pension is based on some assumption of today.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.440]   As that starts to happen, the pensions become underfunded
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.480]   because they no longer have enough capital to make all the disbursements
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.560]   that are supposed to happen.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.800]   And there's a big argument now that there's probably over a trillion dollars
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.640]   of underfunded pension liabilities in the United States,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.400]   many of which are based on the fact that these payout principles
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.440]   were defined by some negotiation or the union and their games.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.760]   And there's a large difference between somebody writing a listicle
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:52.640]   or rewriting a Washington Post story, a business listicle, listicle, listicle.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.680]   Yeah. Somebody rewriting a listicle in BuzzFeed or, you know,
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.520]   somebody rewriting a Wall Street Journal paywall story and business insider.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.520]   So somebody running into a running into a burning building or, you know, right.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.560]   Having a target on their back as a cop in San Francisco.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.160]   These are very different jobs.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.120]   And the white collar knowledge workers are lasting.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.440]   What what's the average tenure right now?
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.480]   Thirty six months, less than 30 months.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.800]   I mean, you're obviously moving from place to place.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.080]   What's the point of the union?
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.480]   It's a competitive labor market.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.280]   And to your point, it's true that in some cases
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.200]   the unions do get a better deal for their members.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.160]   However, there is a deadweight loss for the union itself
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.720]   because the union is representing its own interests.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.400]   One and a half percent.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.280]   So they're taking something.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   They got to come to their skimming.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.600]   They got to pay that Scorsese movie.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.080]   Was it the Irishman? Yeah.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.080]   You really get a taste of the corruption that was there was some skimming going on.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.720]   Everybody gets a little scam all of a sudden, one and a half times.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.120]   But then also the pension fund starts getting, you know,
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.640]   rolled into mob projects or whatever.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   I mean, that's like a while ago, but.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.600]   Yeah, I there were some significant downsides.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.200]   My view of it is we lived in a decade of surplus elites,
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.040]   you know, having these luxury jobs.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.480]   And I'll put in the luxury jobs being a journalist, being a venture capitalist,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.600]   you know, these elitist luxury jobs.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.280]   And in some of them, they became so wildly overcompensated.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.080]   I think they wanted to feel oppressed.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.120]   They wanted to feel like they need a representation.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.400]   And I think they were LARPing to use the term again, live action
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.400]   role playing that they were going to be in a union like they wanted.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.280]   They're LARPing as being victims. Right.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.080]   They wanted to like literally the business insider people
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.520]   were putting up pictures of Henry Blodgett and his.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.240]   They were LARPing grievances. Yes.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.280]   And they're on the street holding a picket sign up.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.960]   And I'm like, what's the matter?
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.480]   Is your keyboard not ergonomic enough at home?
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.160]   You haven't been to an office in three fucking years.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.880]   They didn't get the latest flavor of kind bars or whatever.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.080]   Yeah, no, they didn't get the cherry, the cranberry, the kind bar.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.240]   Q. You Q. You kind bars.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.160]   I mean, like leave the unions for the people who are actually on the front lines.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.600]   It's like, all right.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.400]   So I think, well, we could wrap.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.520]   Good. Should we wrap? It's probably wrap time.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520]   Would you want to do a quick science corner update?
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.160]   I got a lot of room temp superconductor.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.680]   Yeah, there is a actually it's a very interesting.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.960]   You may remember a few episodes ago.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.680]   And if you if you don't remember, you kind of can go back and watch it
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.400]   where I talked a little bit about the effort to try and identify a material
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.440]   that can be superconducting at room temperature, which means no resistance.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.680]   Electrons can flow through the material with no resistance.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.120]   Perfect electricity transfer across distance and also enables the Meissner
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.040]   effect where magnetic waves can reflect off of the material,
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.400]   which can allow things like levitating trains,
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.440]   which is very low friction transportation.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.120]   All these benefits of superconducting materials, quantum computing, etc.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.760]   So yesterday, and I've gotten literally dozens of emails
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.240]   and notes about this in the last 12 hours.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.560]   There was a paper published by a team in South Korea
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.320]   who seemed like a very legit team.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.600]   There's no reason why they would kind of make a fraudulent claim
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.880]   that there is a material that they've identified and measured to show
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.800]   has superconducting properties at room temperature and ambient pressure,
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.760]   where a lot of these efforts historically have been made at room temperature,
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.880]   but they use 200 times atmospheric pressure to compress it.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:19.160]   And it turns out that this material that they're using is a lead appetite,
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.520]   which is a it's a hexagonal crystal that uses calcium phosphate and lead
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.040]   and that some of the calcium, the lead gets replaced with copper
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.000]   and the copper causes the hexagon, the crystal structure to compress
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.680]   a little bit that compressed crystal allows the electrons to flow through.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.800]   This is their theoretical explanation of what's going on.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.360]   It will be replicated.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.160]   People will try and do what they are now claiming they did to demonstrate this.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.280]   There was some condensed matter physics people that sent me an email and said
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.480]   they don't think that this is real.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.040]   They have a great deal of skepticism.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.240]   Let me but sorry, let me just say two things about this.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.360]   You can read the paper.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.480]   You can read the paper. It's on the Internet.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.040]   The cameraman put his glasses on. He's sleeping behind here.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.360]   He's just we're sleeping. Let me take let me say a few things.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.520]   Firstly, I think it's unlikely that these guys are going to make a fraudulent.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.960]   If they did make a fraudulent claim, it would be the end of their careers.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.000]   Their reputation would be damaged. So that may happen.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.600]   If they did not make a fraudulent president of Stanford,
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.240]   if they did not make a fraudulent claim and it is and it does turn out to be real,
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.440]   then I do think it'll end up being
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.720]   the the most important discovery in physics of this century.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.640]   OK, so it's either a complete utter fraud.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.480]   No, no, no. Or it changes the universe.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.120]   I'm being serious. No, look, I know you guys are joking about it, but yeah,
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.920]   we talked about the importance of this material in technology.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.160]   Yes, it's an everyday life.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.080]   And I don't know. I want to build on top of what you're saying.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.640]   The thing that you're saying,
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.800]   the more generalized concept is we have such a poor understanding
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.440]   of the periodic table, just broadly speaking of condensed matter, of physics.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.320]   There's so much about physics and quantum mechanics.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.160]   And just that are still we are just literally poking around, poking around,
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.440]   trying to figure out what's going on.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.760]   And that's what led to this discovery. Suppose a discovery.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.000]   I've made this analogy before.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.280]   But if you take the periodic table
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.080]   and it actually kind of looks like the United States of America,
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.600]   we have like a really good sense of like the upper northwest
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.920]   and like the East Coast.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.920]   And otherwise we don't know anything.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.440]   And I think it was about two and a half years ago.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.360]   At the beginning of the pandemic, there were these three guys
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.360]   and I that started with this idea of just building some machine learning
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.120]   to experiment in silica around different materials. Right.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.920]   And can you guess physical properties?
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.560]   And if you think these properties are better at a certain thing,
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.640]   can we then go and actually make samples and figure it out?
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.360]   And we pointed it at batteries.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.960]   And we said, let's just take the cheapest form of batteries, LFP, lithium.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.800]   Right. That's used in the Model three.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.240]   And let's make better LFP.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.840]   And what we're finding is, holy shit, like we don't know anything.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.120]   And there are these like really big breakthroughs,
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.520]   one which we'll probably announce in like the next few weeks
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.200]   because we just raised a bunch of money around this idea.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.640]   But it's all just people experimenting better and smarter.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.600]   And really what you find is that there just aren't enough of those people doing it.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.640]   And so the cycle time is just too long.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.200]   Well, and this is where I can actually have some.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.240]   It's incredible gain. Transformational.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.320]   As I get smarter, transform, you put in the inputs, you give it the data set.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.880]   We don't know what it's going to come up with.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.600]   And it could profoundly the better version of part of what
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.320]   increase our understanding of this.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.360]   This Korean team did is they they had a separate paper that they published
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.360]   talking about the demonstration of using AI to try and be predictive
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.080]   around quantum mechanics, which is something that people have said.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.200]   We can't really do quantum modeling until we get quantum computers.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.400]   And so there has been this belief that once we get quantum computers,
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.600]   we'll be able to understand the physics of the quantum scale
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.080]   and be able to do modeling that will allow us to do more discovery.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.600]   But we are still very much just poking around and theorizing.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.160]   And every cycle, by the way, in superconductor research,
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.320]   there's a different theory on what causes superconductivity.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.520]   And it shows how little we do actually.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.680]   Yeah. So these guys basically when we were trying to build.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.720]   So if you if you look at like a Tesla Model S or Model X,
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.120]   these are NMC or NCA batteries, right?
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.560]   Very, very, very energy rich, but also very expensive
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.800]   and very complicated batteries that won't scale to the average everyday car.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.320]   And what was crazy in our attempt to take LFP, which is the cheap version
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.840]   and make it as keep the cheapness, but as energy dense as NMC and NCA,
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.640]   we ended up doping it with all kinds of random stuff
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.800]   that you would have never guessed in a million years.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.280]   Given billions of dollars, you would you needed computers to go off
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.000]   and actually make these guesses.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.960]   So this idea that we're going to find all this stuff at the periodic table
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.920]   bumbling around, I think, is such an interesting part of the physical sciences.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.400]   And again, this will lead to infinite energy storage in batteries.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.520]   Yeah, you can put electricity into a battery.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.760]   If you had a superconducting battery and it would cycle forever,
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.280]   no resistance, you could just plug in and get the energy back out.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.320]   So imagine infinite storage on batteries.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.080]   You have to reinvent circuitry completely.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.640]   So you can there are already superconducting circuits
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.480]   that are used in quantum computers and other high end applications.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.400]   But because they're so expensive to cool and so expensive to operate,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.120]   they're not ubiquitous.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   But the power of having them be ubiquitous would be extraordinary.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.960]   Computing for discovery, for AI, for modeling.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.320]   The applications of what we'll end up discovering because of the modeling,
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.400]   we can now do it in a more ubiquitous way is going to be incredible.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.800]   These are very profound moments when they do.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.720]   And if they do happen, we should be excited, optimistic,
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.960]   but obviously very, very cautious about where and when they happen.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.440]   Yeah, I really love you.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.480]   What an incredible.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.960]   So thankful that you guys came and showed up.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   It really means a lot to me. Thank you. Fantastic.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.160]   Yeah, incredible.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.200]   I really love you guys.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.440]   Thank you very, very much for that.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.440]   All right. We'll see everybody at the all in summit.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.280]   Oh, my gosh. Yum, yum.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.440]   It's in like in this is like six weeks more. A little more.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.640]   You have a new party plan.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.080]   You have a new you have a new person to announce.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.440]   I will announce it and then we'll take it out if it's not OK.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.440]   But we did confirm Ray Dalio, so we'll add him to the speaker list.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.600]   We've got a few other guests that we're not going to announce
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.800]   that will be last minute fun surprises for everyone.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.560]   Some fun surprises at the end.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.720]   Really excited to have Ray Dalio.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.200]   Closing in on how the party's going for the summer.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.160]   The parties we we have narrowed down to three themes
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.080]   we think are going to be a lot of fun opening night, Sunday night,
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.240]   the day before the event starts, September 10th.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.480]   I think that is your location.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.840]   Yeah, we are negotiating the final contracts with the locations.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.080]   We've got about a dozen of them, and we're going to narrow it down
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.440]   to the three that give us the best flexibility.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.160]   We'll have the floor plans, which is the last step.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.560]   You know, you got like six weeks, right? Yeah, no, no.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.120]   It's we have more than enough options now.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.400]   So Sunday night, J-Cal's handling the parties, not me.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.200]   I'm doing the parties.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.280]   You want to hear a great all in summit story?
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.760]   Yeah, but let me just go through the three.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.840]   Yeah, the three party themes.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.600]   So opening night is going to be bestie royal.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.680]   The best you love me at James Bond theme.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.440]   So what is that? Tuxedo white tuxedos, white tuxedos.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.560]   Or you could go as a Bond girl or you could go as Austin Powers.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.600]   Anything in that theme casino games, but no black tuxedo.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.280]   You can go black to see the white tuxedo.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.400]   You could go Daniel Craig.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.120]   You could go Sean Connery, Roger Moore.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.000]   You pick you to go.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.120]   You go whatever you like.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.640]   The black tux. I've tried the white tux.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.840]   It doesn't you can do it. Yeah, you go.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.640]   For me, I look like a waiter.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.320]   And so it'd be like I'd like the yacht club of San Francisco.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.960]   And then Monday night we have a good word.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.320]   So it's bucket hat.

[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.080]   You're not a fight each other.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.920]   Yeah, that wouldn't last very long.

[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.640]   It was awkward.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.040]   He didn't fully let me in.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.240]   So it was like you ever see three PO trying to give Han Solo a hug?
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:46.840]   It does like this.
