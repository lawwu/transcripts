[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940]   just something I try to think about when traveling and it's this idea that the thing that you remember
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.220]   after a trip is the peak, the highlight, and the last thing. So I always try to make sure that we
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.340]   do something really memorable towards the end of a trip because that's just how our brains work.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.860]   You know, we're going to remember this really big highlight moment of the trip, which of course we
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.440]   are, but we're also going to usually remember the end of the trip more than the other parts.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.480]   So save something special for the end, try to make a magical thing happen somewhere in the middle,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.300]   and maybe make magic happen every day, of course. But I try to remember the peak end rule when I'm
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.140]   trying to lay out an itinerary for a trip.
