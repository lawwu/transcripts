[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   mentoring can be described as Capital M Mentoring and Small M Mentoring. Capital M is where some
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.720]   person is assigned to you, they're going to imbue some magical phrase or saying or thing,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.920]   and all of a sudden everything is going to work out for you. That form of Capital M Mentoring
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.160]   doesn't exist and has never worked for those that have tried it. The thing that's really
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.000]   productive is Small M Mentoring. And that happens when you model behaviors of really smart people
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.960]   and really capable people, really ethical people. And again, that happens because you're seeing them
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.120]   on a day to day basis, not just in a meeting, but in the gaps between meeting, they'll include you
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.160]   in certain things, or you'll have lunch with them. And this is what I mean by all of these people
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.960]   that are looking for an accelerant in their career, they've robbed themselves of the most
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.080]   powerful accelerant possible, which is capable people to surround themselves with, they are going
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.720]   to look back on these decisions and they're going to regret them.
