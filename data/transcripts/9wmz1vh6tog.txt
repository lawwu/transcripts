[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   Scott writes in to ask, "Hi, Pastor John. I've been a youth pastor in California
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.160]   for about 10 years, and I'm wondering if you can give me some tips on how to
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.000]   avoid burnout. I want to serve faithfully and for the long haul."
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Great question, Scott. Let me just give you some bullet points here.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Number one, love what you do.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Find those wonderful aspects of your job that are really useful for the young people
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   and really godly and really fit you, and give yourself to those.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Do the other stuff that you have to do, but do what you love to do.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I think after 33 years in the ministry, I can say that one of the reasons I lasted
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   is because I found those aspects of the ministry that I just love to do.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I did those with all my heart most of the time and was energized enough
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   to do the parts that weren't as pleasing because I glutted myself on the parts
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   that I really love to do. So that's number one. Love what you do.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Number two, linger with the Lord every day.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Find a time, find a place, stay with Him, listen to Him, be real with Him,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   get to know Him. This is not a performance there or in the service of your kids.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Come out of the closet with the aroma of Christ on you.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Act out of the overflow of what Jesus is to you and you're lingering with Him.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Third, ask the Lord for perseverance.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Ask Him to protect you from burnout.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   That seems so simple and yet I think a lot of pastors don't do it.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I think I probably prayed Psalm 16.1 as much as anything,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   "Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And what I meant was, "Don't let me quit. Don't let me get so discouraged
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I want to walk away. Don't let me not like this ministry.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Restore the joy of the ministry to me every day."
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So pray that He would give you the persevering power that you need.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Here's another one. Keep Sabbath. That is, keep one day in seven to disengage.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Go out to pasture. You're not just a shepherd, you're a sheep,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and sheep need food. Find what spiritually refreshes you on that so-called day off.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And don't default to the world's way.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Movie and supper, movie and supper, movie and supper.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's what the world does to kick back every Friday night.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And what do you do? You go to bed defiled most of the time
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   with a sense of uncleanness that you went to a movie that,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   well, you might be able to find some kind of redeeming feature in it,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   but there was enough risque clothing or no clothing and enough bad language
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and enough mean-spiritedness that you are not spiritually refreshed.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So findâ€”God has a huge, big, beautiful world and lots of works and lots of books.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Find what refreshes your soul. And then get exercise.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Beat your body, Scott. Hammer it three times a week.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Make it sweat and be exhausted. It will reap mental benefits you cannot measure.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I mean that. There is something going on with that that God knows about
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and some psychiatrists know about, but very few people know about,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and it makes a difference. And sleep eight hours a night.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Nothing brought me closer to quitting than sleeplessness.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Hope and rest rise together.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So don't be overly spiritual to say you can get five hours sleep
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and the fruit of the Holy Spirit will carry you.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I think the fruit of the Holy Spirit works often by the Holy Spirit telling you,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   "Hey, you are not God. Go to bed."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   That's the Holy Spirit talking, and what you get from your restedness
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   you got from the Holy Spirit giving you the humility to stop playing God.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And then two more things.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Have a couple of soul brothers that you love to hang out with,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   talk about everything with, talk about big things with,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and then let them pray for you, but just enjoy them.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Enjoy God with them. Enjoy doing things with them.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You need some soul brothers to bear your burdens with you.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And lastly, keep your eyes, Scott, on Christ
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and His loving you and your making much of Him.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And don't let your eye drift towards, "I got to have some growing crowds here
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   to be made much of by the kids. Got to like me."
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And then you start shifting the whole focus off of Christ
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and onto your need for people.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   That's my counsel for not burning out in youth ministry or any ministry.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Excellent. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
