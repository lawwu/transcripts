[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   whether you want to build a portfolio of 20 homes, whether you want to buy multi-family homes,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.880]   commercial properties, or you just want to buy a primary residence, at the end of the day,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.240]   you got to find the home, you got to buy the home, you got to decide if it's a good deal,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.720]   you got to close on it, you got to fund the purchase unless you want to buy it with cash,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.880]   which I'm guessing most people don't. So maybe let's jump into that process
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.080]   and kick off with just someone who's like, "I'm not really sure what I'm doing."
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.280]   You've been an agent. Let's talk a little bit about that process of partnering with someone
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.480]   to help you go through this process instead of just trying to wing it on your own. And when
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.240]   that makes sense, or maybe when it doesn't. Yeah. And if you're going to buy a property,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.840]   you don't know much about it, you definitely want to use a real estate agent in the beginning.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640]   And when you're buying, here's something people don't realize, you don't have to pay your agent.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.960]   If you're buying a house off of the MLS, this would be any property you see off Zillow or Redfin,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.600]   something like that. The seller has already predetermined a certain amount of money
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.440]   they are going to pay the buyer's agent for bringing you to the property.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.200]   So you have a lot of questions. There's paperwork you're not going to understand. You don't know
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.720]   what the process is. It's intimidating. You find a real estate agent and I'll add,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.240]   they're not all the same. There's good agents and bad agents. There's good lawyers and bad
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   lawyers, good doctors and bad ones. You really want to find somebody who's good at what they do.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.640]   They can take a lot of the fear that you have right out of it. It's amazing when
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.360]   you take this scary process and there's a person like me that does this so often it's boring to me.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   Like, "Oh, another one of these. I've walked this path so many times."
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.640]   It's definitely not scary. So that's something that every person who wants to buy a home should
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.320]   know right off the bat. Find a buyer's agent. They're going to answer a lot of the questions
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.520]   that you're going to have and they're going to protect you in ways you didn't even know
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   that you needed to be protected. And maybe we can go through what the actual escrow process
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.080]   looks like or the process from start to finish of what to expect when buying a home if you'd like.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.400]   If you're a little bit more experienced, you bought homes before, one thing that people will
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.000]   look at, especially in a competitive market like ours, Chris, we just realized that we're neighbors,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.400]   we live pretty close to each other, probably I can power in some change away, is you can go
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.280]   directly to the listing agent and you can say, "Hey, I will let you represent me on this deal,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.680]   but I'm going to need some kind of an advantage. I need you to get my offer accepted over the other
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.400]   people. Or I'd like a little bit of a discount on the price if you're getting to represent me here."
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   So there are people who buy a lot of real estate that has said, "Hey, I don't think I need my own
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480]   buyer's agent, necessarily. I still need someone to handle the paperwork." But they go right to
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   the listing agent, they look for an advantage. And that is pretty popular in the Bay Area,
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.440]   where most listings are getting several offers on all of them.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.400]   Yeah, actually, I have bought 2 homes in the Bay Area and both times I've used the seller's agent.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.240]   So we can talk about that a little bit more because I have some thoughts about it. But maybe
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.760]   rewind a little. You said, "It's important. Not all agents are the same. You got to pick the right
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.800]   one." Obviously, not everyone lives in the Bay Area. So you're not going to be the perfect agent
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   for everyone. How does someone find that perfect agent?
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.600]   First thing to look for, find a person that sells a lot of houses. A lot of agents don't. In fact,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.400]   most agents don't. I'd say 90% of agents sell a couple houses a year or less.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.800]   And it's unpopular to say this. The agents get angry because they're offended right now.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.720]   "Just because I only sell 2 houses a year doesn't mean I'm not good." Okay, I know.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.560]   However, tell me anything that you do twice a year that you get really, really good at.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.520]   In general, that's how life works. If you snowboard twice a year for your whole life,
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.880]   you never really get that good at snowboarding. Or it takes you 20 years before you're as good
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.040]   as somebody that just snowboarded every weekend for the whole first year that they got into it.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   Repetition really does develop mastery. I talk about that in the Burr book that I wrote.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.680]   So the first thing I look for is an agent that sells a lot of homes, period. The next thing I
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.480]   want is an agent that owns real estate themselves. At minimum, they got to own their own house. But
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   ideally, I want them to own investment property. It gives a completely different perspective
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.400]   when you've bought a home and you believe in it. And you just get a different set of goggles to
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.080]   look at real estate through. I don't have any kids. I love kids. We were talking about that
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.840]   before the show. But each of you as a dad, I am sure, sees something different when you look at
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   a kid than I do. I don't immediately freak out when they start putting something in their nose.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.800]   I haven't had enough experience of seeing how that could go wrong.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.240]   Rob has seen some of that. So he's going to have a much different emotional response
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   to that marble or that Play-Doh getting a little bit close to the nostrils.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.080]   Real estate agents that own real estate have that sixth sense. They can recognize that's
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   a bad neighborhood. That's not the right tenant. That's not the right floor plan. That's not the
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.800]   right structure. You really want to go to this house that may not look as pretty in the pictures,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.760]   but will be a better deal. The third thing that you want to look for is an agent that
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.000]   understands the financial component of real estate. Many real estate agents are
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.840]   geared to cater to their clients' emotions. They want to be liked.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.320]   They're very high on as an eye on the disprofile. This is how they make their money by being
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   likable. Most people reach out to the agent who's the nicest, the friendliest, the warmest. That
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.400]   doesn't mean they're the smartest. So when you're having conversations, I always want to hear agents
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   that are approaching real estate from a financial perspective. I want to hear them telling me,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   "This is the part of town that's being redeveloped. This is the next up and coming area.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.120]   This is where all the money is going into. This is a property that would function as a rental
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.200]   if you moved out." Even if that's not necessarily what you're looking for,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.760]   you just want to buy a home. If your agent sees things that way, it is very good to hedge your
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.520]   bets in the future because you never know when you have more kids, need more bedrooms, get a new job,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.200]   want to move for some reason. You don't want to be locked into a situation where it's hard
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.480]   to sell that home or it can't be used as a rental property if you want to leave it.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.320]   David, let me ask you something. Does the requirement of having an agent that owns real
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.760]   estate, is that as important if you're just buying a primary residence? Do you weight that
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.640]   a lot heavier for people that are looking to buy investment properties?
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.760]   No, it's the same for a primary residence. Let me tell you why. The first house I ever bought,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.720]   my agent did not own any real estate. And I bought this house in the very end of 2009,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.360]   great time to buy real estate like you were saying, Chris. My agent did not tell me that
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.480]   the property taxes in that area had special assessments assigned to them and were much higher
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.760]   than the normal property taxes. In fact, they ended up being about $250 a month higher.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.120]   So I was expecting $300, they were $550. Now I was buying this as a rental property,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.960]   but even if I had bought buying it to live in... And again, I remember at the time,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.400]   the total mortgage was like $1,300. So bumping it from $1,300 to $1,550 was a pretty significant
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   chunk. It's like a 20% increase almost in my overall payment because they overlooked that
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.040]   property taxes were higher. Now, agents who own real estate themselves would be familiar with the
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.280]   fact that property tax bills come. There's more expenses than just your principal and interest
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.680]   on your mortgage. They would see angles like insurance can increase in this area because
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.120]   it's in a flood zone. I really think she missed it because she had never paid a mortgage on her
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.040]   own. She never had her taxes and her insurance escrowed into her mortgage payment. The next
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.120]   time I bought a house, it was with an agent that had been selling houses for a very long time and
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.080]   sold a lot and owned a lot of real estate herself. And as we went through the process, she educated
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.000]   me. You don't want to buy in that part of town because you're going to pay extra money to get
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.280]   the better school districts. You don't want to buy over there because the taxes are higher.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.640]   You don't want to buy a house like that because with that kind of a roof, your insurance is going
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.280]   to be a lot higher. I learned so much about investing in real estate just from the person
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.920]   that was getting paid to help me. It was like free advice and free knowledge. And it really
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.120]   gave me a different perspective of what to look for and what to avoid.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.800]   I love it. Okay. So I just sent a link to you. There's this guy in Northern California. Maybe
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.240]   you know him. Stanley Lowe. Number one agent in Northern California for 10 years. Looks like and
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.920]   is commonly described in San Mateo County as the Asian Elvis of real estate agents.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.360]   And so when you first said, "Look for someone who sells a lot of houses," I was looking at...
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.840]   I know this guy. I get the flyers in the mail. He sells all the houses. High volume,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.600]   high throughput, not just low income property, all kinds of price ranges.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.120]   Does that mean that if I were looking for a real estate agent, would he be the right guy?
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.080]   Should I consider him even though it might not feel like someone's personality? Maybe that's
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.120]   not the personality I would want as my real estate agent. But do the numbers speak more than
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.240]   a personality? How do you think about that? And if anyone's curious, greenbanker.com is this
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.600]   real estate agent's website. Green without the E.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.440]   He's got it down. I will say that. The marketing, the cowhide blazer, and the big
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.480]   circular glasses. I mean, I'm in, personally.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   That's funny. That's because I'd be running the other way the minute I saw this.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.200]   So he does sell a lot of homes, I'm sure. And so he probably does have some experience.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.400]   My gut would tell me as someone who has worked with a lot of clients and knows a lot of realtors,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.600]   this is probably not someone who's actually going to be representing you.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.640]   He's going to have staff that are going to be handling a lot of it. You're not going to
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.600]   be talking to Stanley. And he's going to likely make up for a lack of negotiation ability and
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   focus on saving you money or making you money if it's a listing with his personality.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.040]   So he's a great marketer and the top producing agents are always the best marketers. This is
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.240]   a problem in our industry. The best agents don't make the most money. The ones that are best at
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.280]   getting the phone to ring make the most money. But that doesn't mean that they're the best when
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.200]   it comes to representing you. So you want someone that sold a lot of houses, but maybe you don't
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.840]   necessarily want the person who markets themselves as the person who sold the most houses.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.600]   And so it's that sweet spot of maybe like the 60th to 90th percentile, but not the very top.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.440]   There's a lot of things people fall for. I sell the most houses in this neighborhood.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.640]   Realtors will use that as a way of saying, "I'm the best. Don't fall for that."
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.000]   It makes sense to our perspective when we're listing the home. "Oh,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.040]   you sell all the houses in the neighborhood. You know how to get me top dollar.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.480]   You just don't realize until you think about it, the buyers don't care.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   The buyers don't care who's selling that house. They are never going to look at who the listing
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.200]   agent is when they're writing their offer. They just care about the house.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.040]   The buyer's agent needs to know the neighborhood. The buyer's agent needs to know
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.560]   the amenities. When you're looking to buy somewhere, you want an agent that knows the
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.200]   area very well. When you're looking to sell, it will never matter how many homes in the
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.280]   area that agent sold. In fact, the only reason they sell a lot of homes in the same area
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.000]   is they put their sign in all the yards and then they go, we call it farming,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.600]   knocking on all the doors and meeting all the people, getting their name out there.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.880]   They're just able to utilize a listing to build leverage to get more.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.800]   But there's no competitive advantage when it comes to representing a seller if you've sold
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.120]   other homes in the area. I wanted to add one thing to that. Well, hey, it sounds like if
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.080]   they're putting signs in everyone's yard, it sounds like they're good marketers,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.560]   which goes back to what you were saying. But I did want to say that one really important
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.920]   piece to agents, just from a consumer side, and as someone that relies on agents pretty heavily,
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.880]   is them having a really thorough Rolodex of vendors that I can use to help me run
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.280]   my properties, whether I'm living in it or not. If I'm buying a short-term rental, for example,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.520]   I know I need a contractor, cleaner, landscaper, pool maintenance person, pest control,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.320]   and probably a plumber, electrician, and all that type of stuff.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.720]   So when I'm calling a realtor, and this goes into how many houses have they sold,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.360]   if they've sold a lot of houses over the last 5-10 years, they probably have a pretty thorough
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.080]   Rolodex. I mean, outdated term. If they use the term Rolodex, maybe they're not with it.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.160]   But if they have a very big contact list of all these different vendors,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.520]   that's what I'm personally looking for in a realtor. Because a lot of the times,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.240]   I really need a firsthand referral to know that I can successfully
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   either live in a property or execute a rental.
