[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   So the Yamnaya are these groups that thrived between about 5,300 and 4,600 years ago in the
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.720]   steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas. They're probably the first people to domesticate
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.280]   the horse. So they expanded the little island of the steppe that's in the Great Hungarian Plain
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.840]   in the Carpathian Basin. You look at the genetic data and there's a 90% population disruption.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   So one of the mysteries of the Yamnaya expansion was everybody had this cognitive bias to think
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.560]   this is very male-driven. You look at the genetic data and you look at the Y chromosomes,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.040]   which track male migration, and the mitochondrial sequences, which are more sensitive to female
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.640]   migration, and it looks like the steppe expansion is very both sexes. The most likely explanation
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280]   for what's happening now is that it actually is a male-biased process, but it's one that's
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.800]   interrupted. So the Yamnaya expansion is very male-biased. It expands to the edge of the range.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.400]   They encounter the corded ware, and in fact the corded ware males absorb and take
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.120]   Yamnaya females, and then they expand further.
