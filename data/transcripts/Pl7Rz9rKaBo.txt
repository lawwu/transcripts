[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   When I look back on my childhood, the things that feel the most valuable for me to have
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.600]   learned was almost entirely stuff that I did myself.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.960]   On my off time, the learning that I performed by my own incentive, that's what stuck with
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   me.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.960]   That's what feels like it lasted.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   I'm like, "Shit.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.080]   If that's the case, I should just let my kids learn what the fuck they want and just enable
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.080]   them.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080]   Put interesting things around them.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   Give them a project.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.160]   If you want to do this project, you're going to have to learn these skills in order to
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160]   do it."
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.520]   I read a huge amount, which I think led to me being a good writer today.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.440]   I just read books about things.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.440]   I don't know.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.120]   In terms of juggling, a lot of physical comedy stuff.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.920]   I did some movies, some short movies.
