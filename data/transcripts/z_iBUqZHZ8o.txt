[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, how much joy did the curse cost me? By his curse on creation, didn't God
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.600]   intentionally put a limiter on the joy that we can have in him in this life?
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.160]   That is a really solid question from a podcast listener named Michael. Hello,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.400]   Pastor John. Can you explain what the futility fall curse cost us today
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.880]   regarding our felt experience of joy? I believe this was the deliberate act of
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.360]   God, so for even obedient Christians, how does the intention of God to subject all
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.320]   of us and all of creation under futility fall curse cost us in God glorifying joy?
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.760]   It seems to me that God intentionally put a limiter on our joy experience in
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.080]   this world, and thus he likewise put a limit on how much we can glorify him, too.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   Am I wrong here? No, you are not wrong. When Adam and Eve sinned, when they
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.800]   preferred their own wisdom to God's wisdom and preferred their own perception
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   of what was good and pleasant to God's perception, they died. God had said in
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.780]   Genesis 2:17, "Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat. In the
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.400]   day that you eat of it, you will surely die." So when they ate, two things
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.920]   happened. The sentence of physical death and separation from God was bang,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.880]   confirmed, gavel came down on the courtroom of heaven, guilty to be hanged
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.920]   by the neck until dead, sentence delivered, execution assured, time fixed
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.680]   in the mind of God. Done. You're dead. And the second thing that happened was the
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.360]   spiritual dimension of it happened in their souls. Oh my goodness, you can see
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.960]   it. Every relationship was ruined, corrupted. They were ashamed of
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   themselves. They were blaming each other. They were blaming God. They were afraid
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.400]   of God. Everything came apart when sin entered the world. So in short, their
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.800]   preference for self over God, and there's the essence of sin, that's what entered
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.000]   the world, their preference for self over God pervaded and ruined every
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.320]   relationship. Self-exaltation, be another name for it,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.680]   self-exaltation ruined everything. It ruined the relationship with self even.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.160]   It made the self insecure because the human self could never be God and that's
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   what the self had just chosen to be. It'll never work. Fallen human
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.120]   beings are built into failures because they can never be the God they want to
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.080]   be. Self-exaltation ruined the relationship with the spouse because now
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.880]   another person is just an encroachment upon my self-rule. Please get out of my
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.540]   life, you're in the way. I want my self-freedom, do what I want to do, and now
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.800]   the spouse, well she or he can never conform to your godlike demand for your
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.480]   own self. So others have to now be used to buttress the self because it's so
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.100]   hopelessly out of sync with its godlike expectation, and so we've ruined, I mean,
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.420]   sin and self-preference and self-exaltation has ruined relationships
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.160]   with other people, and then finally self-exaltation ruined the relationship
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   with God because God is the only one in the reality that deserves to be exalted,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.000]   and so our self-exaltation means we're in high treason against God and
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.920]   rebellion against him and alienated from him. Oh, what a misery was brought into
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.120]   the world because of self-exaltation and preference of self over God. All of that
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.260]   is called death. It is God's judgment, not just a kind of natural development. It
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.780]   was promised in 217, it was executed by God. God warned of death, and now he
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.700]   delivers. He hands them over actively into the folly and ruin that they have
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.640]   chosen. Now, Michael is right that when sin entered the world, therefore God
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.520]   subjected the world to a spiritual death as well as a physical corruption, and God
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:49.120]   put sinful man in a position where he could not glorify God from the heart,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.760]   precisely because he could not see and savor the all-satisfying beauty of God
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   with the heart. His heart was blind to the beauty of God, and therefore he was
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   not able to delight in God, and therefore his joy was shriveled, and his
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.240]   capacities to glorify God by enjoying God were dead. Probably the best
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.160]   description of this fallen condition of the human heart, unable to see and savor
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.280]   the beauty of God, and therefore unable to glorify God from the heart, the best
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.560]   description is Ephesians 2, 1 to 3. You were dead in your trespasses and sins
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.640]   in which you once walked, following the age of this world, following the prince
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.800]   of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.960]   disobedience, among whom we all once conducted ourselves in the passions of
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.880]   our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.080]   children of wrath like the rest of mankind. Good night, that's awful. This is
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.880]   a horrible description of human nature. Until God breaks in, in verse 4, and
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:19.400]   makes us alive, we're called dead. Mankind is dead. But ironically, it's a very
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.080]   active deadness. We're sinning, we're trespassing, we're walking according to
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.200]   the spirit of the age, we're in lockstep with the devil. By nature, sons of
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.480]   disobedience, we're children of wrath. That's a really active dead man. So, we
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.800]   have plenty of desires as dead people. Desires of the body, it says. We're
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.160]   following the desires of the body, we're following the desires of the mind, but
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.440]   they were all dead desires. That is, they were leading to ruin, and were totally
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.560]   insensitive, dull, impervious, dead to the most thrilling desires in the world,
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.160]   namely, desires for God. That's what deadness means ever since Adam and Eve
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.440]   fell into sin. Dead to delight in God. We can't delight in Him because we're blind
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.800]   to His beauty, and we can't glorify Him because we can't delight in Him. So yes,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:26.720]   Michael, yes, the fall was God's handing us over to a blindness and a deadness
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.840]   that kept us and keeps us from seeing the all-satisfying reality of God, and
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:41.160]   therefore keeps us from glorifying God from the heart. But, there's a great old
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.640]   sermon by Martin Lloyd-Jones about "But God," and it's based on Ephesians 2:4,
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.760]   "But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:01.520]   even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ, by
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.880]   grace you've been saved, and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.960]   heavenly places," and here's the purpose, "so that in the coming ages He might show
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:19.240]   the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus." So, we
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.960]   see here the ultimate purpose of all these years, centuries, of shutting down
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:35.800]   our joy and shutting down our ability to glorify God from the heart. Why? So that
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:43.120]   in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of grace. That grace
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.520]   shines all the more brightly because of the deadness and blindness from which
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:09:00.080]   God saves us. So, if we stand back from the fall of Adam and Eve and the fall of
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.320]   the whole human race into sin and spiritual deadness, and we ask this, "What
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.000]   was the purpose of all that? Why did God let that happen?" We can answer with the
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.200]   words of Genesis 50, verse 20, paraphrasing, "You, Satan, meant it for evil, you
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:32.920]   snake. You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good, and the good was this,"
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:42.640]   Ephesians 1:6, "to the praise of the glory of His grace." He consigned, Paul says, "He
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.840]   consigned all things to deadness and disobedience in order that in the coming
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   ages He might make known or show the immeasurable riches of His grace and
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:03.000]   kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, and from that showing would flow
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.040]   joy and praise that never could have appeared without the fall." Amen. What
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.440]   grace that we can hope for a place where the curse is rescinded and all creation
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.360]   will fully praise its maker like nothing we can imagine right now, including us in
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.920]   Christ enjoying a full and unbroken joy for all of eternity. Thank you, Pastor
