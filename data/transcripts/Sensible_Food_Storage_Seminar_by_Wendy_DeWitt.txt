[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.120]   The audio file you're about to hear is a presentation by Wendy DeWitt.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.720]   She presented the content in this seminar
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.760]   to a group of people discussing how to set aside
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.880]   and store the food that you need to keep your family through
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.680]   a year. This audio is pulled from a video which is available on YouTube.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.200]   That video has some visual aid but the audio will be easily accessible
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.400]   with the exception of her discussion on solar ovens where you won't be able to
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.440]   see it unless you go
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.800]   and watch the video. If you'd like more information

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:38.880]   Hi my name is Wendy DeWitt and I'd like to thank you for joining me.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.200]   During the class I'm going to be referring to a booklet which I've written
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.880]   it's called Everything Under the Sun. All the information from the class is in this
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.480]   booklet
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.600]   it's available online, it's free, and you can get it at
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.800]   everythingunderthesunblog.blogspot.com
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   or you can email at wdwitt22@gmail.com
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.280]   How many of you have a cell phone?
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.960]   Raise of hands. Almost everyone's got a cell phone. How many of you have
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.240]   a year's supply? Not as many hands go up on that one.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.440]   In 1987 Ezra Taft Benson said the counsel to store food
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   may be as essential to your temporal welfare as boarding the Arquoise in the
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.600]   days of Noah.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.280]   That's life and death. More recently the
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.480]   Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Levitt
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.280]   was counseling citizens to have at least a three-month supply
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.520]   of food, water, and medicine. I've been teaching this class for more than 20
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.040]   years
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.680]   and I've never understood why people have chosen to ignore
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.280]   this kind of wise counsel. I've heard all the excuses and I finally came up with
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.920]   my own
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   top 10 reasons why I don't have my year's supply.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.880]   Number 10, my neighbors have a two-year supply.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.840]   It's more likely that your neighbors don't have any food at all.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.960]   Very few people have made the effort to be prepared for an emergency.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.360]   So if your plan is to eat your neighbor's food, first off that's
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.240]   probably not very nice and second off it's probably not a very good plan.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.000]   Number 9, I'm just gonna move in with my parents or my children.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.880]   Not a good plan all by itself. A lot of people believe that when times get bad
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.280]   we're all just going to band together and we'll share our food and everyone
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.920]   will survive.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.480]   The problem with that is nobody's sharing food so we won't survive for very long.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.240]   And another problem is if you consider that if there were any kind
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.440]   of epidemic or pandemic you couldn't
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.400]   band together, you couldn't share, so you may have to survive
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.600]   on just what's in your home. Number 8, isn't that what my taxes are for?
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.080]   If there were any kind of national crisis or emergency,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.880]   how long do you really think it would be before a government agency would reach
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.240]   you?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.440]   And besides the government has been telling us to have a three-month supply
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.760]   of food, water, and medicines. Number 7,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.800]   I donate to my church
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.440]   and I assume when things get bad they're just going to take care of me.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.200]   I think a lot of people are expecting miracles in these times because they're
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   not storing food.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.280]   Elijah's never-ending barrel or maybe there's a Joseph of Egypt out there who's
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.480]   storing for everyone.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200]   I would suggest that the responsibility
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.960]   to have an emergency supply for your family isn't your neighbors,
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.200]   it isn't the government's, and it's not the church's.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.320]   It's yours. Number 6,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.200]   I have a year's supply and the bullets to go with it.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.680]   I've heard people say, "Why would I go to all the effort
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.560]   of storing food for my family just to have some guy with a gun
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   come to my home and either threaten or kill my family
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.120]   to take it away?" And I respond back, "Are you afraid of the guy with the gun?
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.520]   Because you should be more afraid of becoming
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.400]   the guy with the gun. What would you be willing to do
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.880]   if you were watching your child starve to death? I promise you would lie,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.120]   cheat, steal, and you
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.040]   would become the guy with the gun to save your child's life.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.560]   Food storage isn't just about your temporal welfare,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.960]   it's also about your spiritual salvation. Number 5,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.000]   the boat and the four-wheelers are taking up all my storage space.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.280]   Number 4,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.760]   I've got a thousand pounds of wheat, what else do I need?
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.880]   Unless you're eating that wheat on a daily basis and your body's accustomed to it,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.800]   that wheat could kill you faster than a famine.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.360]   Number 3, I've decided I'm just going to store non-perishable items
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.720]   and then I'm going to trade for food. I kind of chuckle, I'm thinking, "Good luck eating
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.800]   those gold coins."
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.440]   Because when people are starving, they're not going to share their food.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.200]   They're not going to trade their food. And I guess the other point would be
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.880]   if they do, you're going to be buying the most expensive bowl of soup that you ever
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.400]   ate.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.520]   Number 2, I can't afford scrapbooking
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.640]   and food storage.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.800]   The average food storage can cost as little as a dollar
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.080]   a day. When I ask how many of you have cell phones,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.160]   I know everyone's going to raise their hand and I know
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.120]   that you spend more than a dollar a day on that service. Is your cell phone
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.200]   really more important than your family's survival?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.600]   And the number one reason why I don't have my year's supply,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.240]   I'm waiting for them to sell Papa John's dehydrated pizza.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.680]   Food storage has such a stigma attached to it. If it's not
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.880]   wheat, beans, and powdered milk, it can't be food storage.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.280]   And with the system that I'm going to show you, you could be eating sweet and
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   sour chicken,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.560]   minestrone, enchiladas, even chocolate chip cookies.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   Your imagination and your pocketbook are just about the only limitations that you
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.960]   have.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.080]   Most people understand the importance of having emergency supplies.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.440]   They know they should have it. They want to have it. Sometimes they just don't know
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.080]   how.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.400]   There are so many questions. What do you store? How do you store it?
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.800]   How do I rotate it? What will it cost? There are so
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.840]   many questions that it becomes overwhelming
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.120]   and they just give up. I'm hoping that in this class I'm going to be able to
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.640]   answer those questions for you
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   and give you a new attitude about food storage. Now the system I use
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.160]   is based on a worst-case scenario.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.960]   And I recognize there are worst cases, but I'm going to give a survivable
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.080]   worst-case scenario
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.560]   that there's no electricity, no running water, no stores to go to,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.720]   and no help is coming. Even in that scenario,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.080]   my family can not only survive, but we're going to be eating
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.280]   chocolate brownies.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.920]   What do you store and how much do you store? Before I started the system, I would
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.200]   look at my food storage, the stacks of wheat
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.000]   and beans and powdered milk and legumes, whatever they are.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.160]   And I'd think, "I can't make dinner out of this.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.520]   What's for dinner?" And it was kind of depressing. And I thought, "There's got to
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.440]   be a better way."
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.880]   And I decided I was going to put the food I love
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.320]   into my food storage. So I created a system.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.680]   Now here's the system. It's very simple. You're going to take 14 note cards
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.480]   and you're going to choose seven breakfasts and seven dinners
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.000]   that your family loves. Things that you wouldn't mind having
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.920]   once a week for a year. Now if you're like my husband Colin,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.000]   first thing he said was, "Did she say lunch? I didn't hear lunch."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.840]   I said, "Honey, we're going to get up late. We're going to go to bed early.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.200]   I'm not planning lunch." The truth is, if we're in a worst-case scenario,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.680]   we're not going to be able to be cooking dinner at five o'clock with solar
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.320]   cooking.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.880]   That's what I'm going to be doing most of my cooking in if we have no
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.660]   electricity.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.080]   And so we're going to have breakfast in the morning. We'll have our
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.120]   big meal in the middle of the day like our ancestors used to do.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.560]   And then during those good cooking hours, I'm going to be making a daily
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.520]   loaf of homemade bread. And we'll have that in the evening. So we really do have
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.400]   the three meals.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.760]   Just had to tease him a little bit. So you've got your
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.000]   seven breakfasts and your seven dinners, your 14 cards.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.040]   You're going to have these meals once a week for a year.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.640]   There's 52 weeks in the year, so you're going to have them 52 times.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.200]   If spaghetti were one of my meals, and it took a jar of spaghetti sauce
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.960]   and a pound of noodles and maybe a pint of sausage,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.040]   the water to cook the noodles in, the salt, everything
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.160]   that it takes to have that meal. Maybe you want to have garlic toast.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.360]   Whatever you're going to plan to have with your spaghetti,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.400]   you multiply everything by 52. When you're done,
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.600]   this card is going to tell you exactly what it's going to take to feed your
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   family spaghetti
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.840]   once a week for a year. You fill out the rest of the cards,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.680]   and you know exactly what it's going to take for an entire
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.120]   year supply. Don't forget to add, if you're going to have the breads,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.920]   if you want to have chocolate cake, pies, whatever your desserts are,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.320]   everything that it's going to take to feed your family for a year.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.480]   Don't forget to add the spices and the water, everything that it takes.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.760]   The system is very simple and
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.520]   straightforward. Does anybody have any questions about the system?
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   Yes. I have celiac, and I was wondering if you have any suggestions for using
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.360]   your system for those of us who have food allergies.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.880]   The system actually works really well for that because
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.800]   you're the one who's deciding exactly what goes into your food storage.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.920]   Now there's two ways that you can do this. If you have
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.200]   a not so severe allergy and it's not taking a lot of foods out of your
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.280]   storage, you just plan your meals around
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   not having those foods in your food storage. If it's pretty severe and
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.720]   there are a lot of things that you can't have,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.000]   have two separate ones. Have one for your family and all the things that they like,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   and then a separate one for you. It's not that big of a deal to do
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.960]   because you're going to know what you can have
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.120]   and what you like. Also you want to have,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.480]   if you've got rice flour, if you're buying pancake mixes and things that have
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.200]   rice flour,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.440]   you're going to want to learn how to make your own. Get online and figure out how
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.240]   to make rice flour. It's very simple.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.280]   Have a grinder and store them in their original form.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.840]   The oats, the rice, brown rice. There's a brown rice flour you can use.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.360]   And just learn how to make those mixes yourself,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.040]   and it's just that simple. It works for allergies. It works for
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.640]   if you have food problems, diabetes. There's all kinds of problems that
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.680]   people have, and they're not able to just pick out any food storage. It's very
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.440]   specific.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.040]   So it's good for that, but it's also good if you just have different tastes.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   My husband likes oatmeal. He wants to have oatmeal for breakfast
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.000]   three times a week. I like oatmeal. I'm not having it three times a week.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.360]   So we actually have separate breakfasts. I have malt meal
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.520]   and rice pudding and different things, and it's not a problem for me to make up
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.720]   separate cards for him
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.960]   and separate cards for me, and I shop according to those cards.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.560]   So it's a very simple process that way. This system
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.080]   can save you time and effort and money
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.960]   because you're no longer buying foods that you don't eat or even like.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.680]   You're only going to buy what you need. You're not going to buy too much
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.960]   or too little. I used to buy dehydrated apples
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.320]   by the case. It was one of those foods that I'm looking at it going,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.400]   "That would be a good snack. It's got fruit. That would be something good."
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.600]   And I just kept buying them. I had cases of them.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.760]   Well, when I started the system, I realized what I really wanted
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   was to have homemade apple pie every Sunday.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.080]   And all I need for that is nine cans
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.480]   of dehydrated apples. It's a great system. You are the one that decides
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.000]   how much you eat, what you eat, even how often you eat.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.160]   And it is wonderful for the individuality
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.560]   that it provides you. Now you've got your
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.160]   your 14 cards. There are
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.200]   recipes in the booklet that...
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.120]   the 14 cards, you're welcome. I want you to use your own recipes. I want you to make up
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.000]   your own recipes.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.400]   But if you get into the booklet, there's about 40 recipes in here.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.200]   I put them in mostly to show you the variety of foods
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   that can be in a food storage. You're going to be surprised at the kind of
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.960]   things that you can have.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   Chicken creole and sweet and sour chicken, enchiladas. There are so many
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.520]   foods that you would not have thought
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.000]   would be food storage. So you're welcome to use the recipes, but I want you to use your
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.840]   own, your favorite recipe, because that's the way you're going to put the food you
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.280]   love
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.720]   into your food storage. Now once you get
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.240]   your cards all made up, I want you to make...
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.680]   get a notebook. This will be your food storage notebook, and you're going to make
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.360]   a shopping list. My shopping list has five columns in it.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.600]   First one is the food. It's an alphabetical listing of
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.280]   everything that's on my card. Every spice, every meat,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.880]   everything that's on those cards. You transfer it to this shopping list.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.200]   If I were to be looking at my rice column,
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.240]   it would say rice under the food item.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.160]   Then the next column is all the meals that that food is in.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.840]   I've got 36 cups in my salmon and rice, 36 cups in my sweet and sour,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.480]   for a total of 72 cups of rice. You go, okay,
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.080]   how many pounds is 72 cups of rice? If you go to the back of the booklet,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.360]   there's going to be a couple of pages called the equivalency pages,
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.480]   and in there you're going to find all this great information.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.000]   Two cups of sugar in a pound of sugar. If you look at the rice, it's going to say
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.520]   rice has a 30-year shelf life. There are 12 cups
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.380]   of rice in a number 10 can. There are two and a third cups of rice
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.120]   in a pound, and that one cup of rice makes three cups cooked.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.280]   So all the information that you're going to need to take
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.040]   the hundreds, you will have hundreds, of teaspoons of salt
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   and spices and all these foods, teaspoons, tablespoons, cups,
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.160]   and it's going to translate it, those equivalency pages,
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.800]   into what you'll actually buy in the store. So it will save you a lot of time
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.240]   and you'll be able to say in your third column what you need.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.800]   You say 72 cups of rice. That will equate to
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.920]   six number 10 cans. So that's what you'll be able to buy. The fourth column
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.080]   has a lot of important information. It's the food that you already have,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.240]   where it's stored, and when you bought it. For rotation purposes, this is important
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.920]   information.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.880]   And the last column is how much I need to buy. So you've got the food,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.080]   the meals, what you need, what you have, and what you still need to buy.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.600]   You'll take this notebook everywhere with you when you go shopping,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.000]   and when you see food on sale, you buy it, you mark it off, you're going to know
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.280]   exactly how much you need.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.400]   You'll date it and you will put it away.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.520]   Now where do you store an entire year of supply?
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.640]   You think it's this massive amount of food. And actually,
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.160]   a year's supply for one person will fit under a twin size bed.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.880]   So you don't have to make little tables out of wheat cans and put tablecloths on them.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.560]   You don't have to have the rolling shelves.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.760]   You know, just go ahead and whatever is under your bed, it's never going to be
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.640]   more important
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.840]   than your family's survival. Keep it in your house.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.360]   If you live in a desert, you don't want to put it in the garage or in the attic.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.600]   You might as well not buy it,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.280]   because heat, light, air, and moisture
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.040]   will destroy your food storage very quickly. Your shelf life will go to nothing.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.440]   So,
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.640]   this is an investment. This can save your family's life. Take care of it.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.280]   Keep it in your home where you've got a good temperature control.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.320]   Alright, rotation.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.960]   That's one of the most frustrating things about food storage,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.360]   because I know a lot of you have had food storage in the past,
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.120]   and it wasn't food that you ate. You didn't even like it, but you stored it
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.000]   because somebody told you to store legumes.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.200]   And you didn't eat it, so it went to waste.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.840]   Or, I've had systems before where I think there's 20 pounds of spaghetti in the
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.900]   cupboard, and I'm digging through there, and half an hour later there's no
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.600]   spaghetti,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.040]   but I find a can of powdered milk from 1976.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.600]   And you've all done that. So, that doesn't happen to me anymore
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.680]   with this system. What I'll do
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.840]   is, in a timely manner, I will buy
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.880]   all my food storage. Now, that doesn't mean in a week, but it doesn't mean five
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.440]   years.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.520]   In a timely manner, you're going to eventually
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.720]   check off that last item in your book. You're going to close the book
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.880]   for a year. That's the best part about rotation.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.280]   It's a yearly process. I don't think about my food storage all year long.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.880]   And then, once a year, I'll take out my book, and I will go
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.760]   alphabetically down every column and every item.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.640]   And what I'm looking for is any food that looks like it's going to be coming
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.840]   up for expiration
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.680]   in the coming year. If it is, I'll note how much
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.400]   it is. I will go out and buy it. I'll
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.960]   repackage it however it needs to be packaged, if it's vacuum packed or
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.400]   in the number 10 cans. Date it. Mark in my book that I have a new date for that
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:55.920]   food.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.000]   I'll put it under the bed, and I'll take the food that's coming up for
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.800]   expiration
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.880]   and put it in my kitchen pantry for daily use. So,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.520]   I think the best part about this particular system for me was
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.360]   I don't have to do rotation more than once a year, and I always have
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.080]   a full year supply. I'm not gonna worry about if I'm ready to go to the store
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.320]   the next day, and I need to
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.080]   replenish whatever it is, and something happens,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.800]   I'm stuck. I don't touch my food storage food
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.860]   at all, unless it's time to rotate it into my kitchen pantry.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.280]   I really like that part of the program because
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.640]   I feel that security of knowing no matter what happens, no matter when it
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.240]   happens,
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.000]   I'm prepared. Alright,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.420]   another thing that helps me with the rotation is that I'm
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.780]   all about long shelf life. I won't have anything in my food storage that doesn't
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.560]   have at least a
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.200]   three-year shelf life. Most of my food has a 10,
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.600]   20, 30-year shelf life. Some of it's indefinite.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.920]   I love the indefinite food. Try to get those. If you will go to
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.840]   ProvidentLiving.org, the website there is going to
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.720]   tell you the latest information about dry pack foods. This is
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.160]   what dry pack food looks like. It's the number 10 can, and
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.800]   it has an oxygen packet inside. The website there
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.360]   is talking about the dry pack foods that have 30
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.200]   year shelf life. They are beans, rice,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.440]   wheat, apples, macaroni, oats,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.720]   potato flakes, onions, spaghetti, sugar.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.400]   Sugar has an indefinite shelf life. They're even giving powdered milk
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.720]   a 20-year shelf life. Keep in mind,
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.160]   the longer you hold on to it,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.600]   the less the quality and the nutritional value is going to be.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.200]   If you open it 30 years later, it's certainly not going to be
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.920]   as tasty or nutritional as if you opened it in five years.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.240]   But that's a decision that you get to make. The point is
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.600]   that it is safe to eat, that it will sustain
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.600]   life. If we're eating food storage,
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.800]   that's what it's all about, is sustaining life. So 30-year shelf life on some of
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.420]   those foods.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.200]   I didn't have a lot of canned foods in my storage because I thought it had
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.280]   maybe a one or two-year shelf life. On this website it says,
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.720]   "For emergency storage, commercially canned foods in metal or jars
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.920]   will remain safe to consume as long as the seal
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.920]   has not been broken." You understand that this is the seal,
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.560]   and if there is any damage to the can,
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.320]   if it's dented, if it's bulging, if it's weeping,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.520]   if you open it and it spurts, then that's not safe.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.720]   The old saying, "When in doubt, throw it out," you remember that.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.680]   But if the seal is still intact, it says, "As long as."
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.720]   To me, that's a long time. So I'm pretty excited about that.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.120]   The Canned Food Alliance concurs, and they say that canned food is safe to eat
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.920]   as long as the can is not damaged in any way. So
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.160]   I have begun putting a lot more canned foods in my food storage.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.760]   First off, because it takes less fuel to cook because it's already cooked,
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.120]   and I don't have to store as much water because
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.320]   it's already got the water, it's fully cooked. So I've got fruits and vegetables and a lot of
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:12.920]   foods
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.240]   that I didn't have before because I was about the long shelf life.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.320]   If you go to the Hormel website, they actually say that their Hormel chili
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.520]   has an indefinite shelf life. On their website, they say that. So they
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.000]   really have discovered canned foods last much,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.360]   much longer than we ever imagined. Another way that I am able to get the
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.840]   long shelf life that I like
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.240]   is with food exchanges. I don't store oil,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.600]   I'll only store shortening. Shortening has, unopened shortening,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.920]   a 10-year shelf life. And even after you open it, there's a little trick that you
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.520]   can use.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.000]   You've all had the five-pound can of shortening and you get to the bottom and it's
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.680]   rancid
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.120]   and you toss it out. Well, when you open your shortening now,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.680]   take what you need and then melt the shortening,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.880]   the rest of the shortening, and pour it into
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.800]   mason jars, any size mason jar. While it's hot,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.880]   make sure the rim is clean, put a lid on it and a ring on it.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.320]   This is a lid and a ring. Put the lid on it and put the ring on it.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.920]   And as it cools, that exchange of heat
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.280]   will seal the jar and it'll be just like it's never been opened.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.800]   So you can keep your shortening for a lot longer. Another food exchange that I
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.360]   use,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.480]   I store cream of tartar and baking soda.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.560]   Both of those items have an indefinite shelf life.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.120]   If you combine those two items, and it's in the booklet, how to combine them,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.960]   if you combine those two items, you can make baking powder. So you've got
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.240]   three items that have indefinite shelf life. The
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.040]   other one I do, powdered eggs. I don't store powdered eggs, I'll store
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.920]   unflavored gelatin, like the Knox unflavored gelatin, but you can buy it
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.840]   generic, you don't have to buy the Knox. Buy it in bulk, it's much cheaper in bulk.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.280]   And for about three cents a teaspoon, you add
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.340]   hot water and cold water to the Knox unflavored gelatin,
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.800]   and that is a substitute for an egg. And you can put that in your
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.680]   brownies, in your cakes, muffins, anything that you're baking,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.520]   you can exchange with the unflavored gelatin, and that has an indefinite shelf
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:15.880]   life.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.680]   So there's a lot of ways to get that long shelf life.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   When you're doing your
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.880]   yearly food rotation and checking things out, you're going to
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.240]   visually check every one of your vacuum sealed
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.520]   foods. I pull out the box and I will open it up and
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.560]   actually touch the top of every single jar to make sure that it's still sealed.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.360]   If it's come undone, you might as well not have bothered because
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.520]   air has gotten to the food and it's not going to extend the shelf life.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.640]   So visually, when you're doing that yearly check, visually check
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.920]   every one of your jars vacuum sealed. Now we're going to talk about vacuum sealing.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   What you're using is a vacuum sealer of some kind, a vacuum
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.240]   they've got all kinds of different kinds. I have
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.640]   just gone back to the Food Saver. These things last forever.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.880]   My sister's got one that's 30 years old and it's still working.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.520]   So this is a Food Saver. They cost about a hundred dollars new.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.720]   I don't want you to buy it new. I want you to go online.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.560]   You go to one of those sites where you buy from your neighbors or
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.840]   the Bay Place where you bid. You can go ahead and check those out.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.240]   Every time I've checked online in these different places,
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.800]   there are at least a hundred Food Savers that they're selling,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.840]   usually about twenty, maybe thirty dollars. Some of them are brand new.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   Some of them have all the attachments with them. So go online
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.280]   and don't buy it brand new. Save a lot of money. The one thing that you're looking
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:44.880]   for
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.240]   on your Food Saver is the little porthole. It has to have a little porthole on the top.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.000]   This part I never use. You've seen
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.360]   Food Savers that they do the little bags and that's really cool
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.280]   but they don't hold the seal. This is not good for long-term storage.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.680]   Eventually every single bag that we've ever done
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.720]   has lost its seal. So we only do
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.560]   the vacuum sealing with the jars. You're going to get,
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.040]   besides the vacuum, the Food Saver, you're going to get
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.200]   a jar sealer attachment. This is the regular mouth. This is the wide mouth.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.920]   I get both of them. They're about ten dollars each and that way you can use
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.760]   all of your jars. You can only use standard mason jars.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.440]   You can't use spaghetti food jars, baby food jars. It has to be the standard
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.960]   mason jar. So you're going to take your jar sealer attachment.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.560]   It's got a little hose. Make sure it comes with the hose. You plug it into that
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.520]   little porthole
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.840]   and you're going to take... you want to sterilize your bottles.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.400]   Run them through the dishwasher. This is just an air exchange.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.720]   It doesn't sterilize anything. You want to run this through the dishwasher. Make sure your
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.360]   lids are clean.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   But you put your food in the jar. You put your lid on. You don't have to heat it or
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.600]   do anything special to it.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.640]   You put your jar sealer over the top of it and then you push the button.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.920]   And within about 10 seconds it will have pulled the air
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.080]   out of the jar. And this should stay sealed
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.600]   until you open it. Like I say, I check every year to make sure that nothing's come
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.880]   unsealed, but generally speaking this will stay sealed
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.000]   until you open it. And when you open it, if you're careful
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.160]   and don't bend the lid, you can just take it off like that
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.160]   and you can reuse this lid over and over.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.720]   Alright, are there any questions about vacuum sealing foods?
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.360]   Yes? What is the shelf life of the vacuum sealed foods?
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.280]   That's really going to depend on kind of where you live
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.680]   and how you take care of your foods. I live in the desert
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.800]   and it's, you know, I get a three-year shelf life out of my food storage, out of my
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.840]   vacuum sealed foods.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.040]   If you live in the mountains and you've got a basement, a nice cool dark basement,
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.000]   your vacuum sealed foods will last longer. Five years, maybe
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.040]   more. As you experiment with this and you test them every year
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.280]   when you're doing your rotation, you can open up a jar of
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.760]   M&M's, that's the best part, and test it and make sure that they're still good.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.480]   And you'll get a better idea as you practice with it.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.640]   I think the least amount of shelf life
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.760]   is my chocolates. It's two years on that, but I kind of have to confess that it's
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.720]   probably because
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.920]   I eat them before they ever get past two years. So you'll have to experiment with
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.000]   chocolates yourself and see how long they'll last.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.360]   What the Food Saver does
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.120]   for me is it put the foods, the real foods
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.440]   I love, into my food storage. Because
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.200]   if you've got foods that have a high moisture, oil,
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.880]   or sugar content, they can't be sealed in the number 10 cans.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.080]   So vacuum packing will put all of those foods,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.480]   by putting them in glass jars, is going to put those foods,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.040]   raisins, nuts, chocolates, granola bars,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.760]   brown rice, almost anything that will sit in your kitchen pantry on the shelf,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.800]   you can vacuum pack. You can vacuum seal them
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.680]   and it's going to extend the shelf life, like I say, depending on where you live
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.160]   and how well you take care of it,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.200]   by at least three years, maybe five years,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.960]   maybe more. You have to do the testing on that.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.360]   This is what changed my whole concept
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.480]   of food storage. This is the base, the basis of my system.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.440]   I know it doesn't look that great, but this is
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.120]   real meat. This is bottled chicken. This is what makes my food storage
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.640]   chicken enchiladas, it's real chicken. Beef, stew,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.880]   it's real beef. This is solid meat, it's
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.520]   fully cooked, ready to eat, it makes its own juice,
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.640]   it's tender, it sits on the pantry shelf, needs no refrigeration, just like you can
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.400]   tuna fish,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.960]   but it's going to taste so much better than your canned meats
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.080]   and it's going to be cheaper because you're going to be buying
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.400]   all your meats on sale. There's hardly any meat that you can't
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.440]   bottle. You can do beef, chicken,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.520]   turkey, ham,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.000]   fish, it will actually dissolve the bones in fish. I've even had moose.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.480]   So I joke that say if you can catch it, you can can it.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.160]   I can't
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.040]   say enough good things about this because this does change your food
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.560]   storage
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.960]   to know that you can have real meat. Now you're having real
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.320]   meals. The process could not be simpler. You're going to start with a pressure
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:32.880]   canner
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.080]   and there is a difference
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.680]   between a pressure canner and a pressure cooker.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.840]   A pressure cooker is a thin metal pot.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.480]   It's got a little lid that goes on the top and it screws on like that. It just kind of
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.180]   twists on.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.000]   Then it has a little cap that goes on the top of it. When it gets to a certain
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.720]   pressure
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.080]   or heat, it starts rocking back and forth. That's a pressure cooker.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.520]   You can't bottle meats
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.680]   in a pressure cooker. It might work.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.760]   You might put them in there and it might seal, but it's not safe.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.040]   You haven't had it at the right pressure or the right time. Don't do it with a
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.240]   pressure cooker. You have to have a pressure canner.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.360]   A pressure canner is a much heavier metal.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.520]   You've got the lid.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.160]   If you don't have a pressure canner already, I'm going to suggest that you
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:21.600]   buy
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.800]   metal to metal. There's no rubber gasket inside of here.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.160]   If you've already got a canner and it has the rubber gasket, that's fine. It'll
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.600]   work.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.760]   But I suggest that you order some more
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.000]   gaskets because at some point it will be the fatal flaw of
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.360]   that mechanism. It's going to go bad and you'll have steam pouring down everywhere.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.840]   It's going to have wing nuts as some kind of mechanism to hold
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.440]   the lid down. It's going to have a pressure release valve.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.080]   I have five pressure canners that I bought online.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   One of them is over 80 years old
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.280]   and it still works metal to metal. It has a pressure release valve that is just a
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:58.880]   valve that
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.960]   is up when it's open and you push it down when it's closed. This one actually has
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.360]   a little weight, 5, 10, 15 and you put the weight on there
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.880]   to close up the valve. Then it's going to have a pressure gauge
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.800]   and that's going to have 5, 10, 15 and then the digits in between to let you know
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.320]   how many pounds of pressure you're cooking. The
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.200]   pounds of pressure that you need to use is going to depend on
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   your altitude. So when you get a pressure canner,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.680]   if you get a used one, it's not going to have an instruction booklet,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.520]   but you can go online, know what your altitude is and it will tell you how
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.720]   many pounds of pressure
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.120]   you need to cook at. I'm in the desert and I
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.240]   cook at 10 pounds of pressure. If you're higher up in the mountains it could be 13, 14.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.040]   So that's very important. Look that up when you get your pressure canner.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.560]   Let's start with the bottles.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.760]   If you have never bottled
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.840]   meat before, I want you to,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.120]   I'm going to suggest that you buy new bottles.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.800]   If you've got bottles that came from grandma's attic or a thrift shop or a yard sale
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.400]   or something,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.360]   you don't know how old they are. You don't know how many times they've been used.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.240]   It's really sad to have that really yummy meat inside the canner
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.600]   and you open it up and the bottle had a hairline crack
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.120]   and there's meat floating in there. So I suggest you buy new bottles
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.920]   and then you can use them over and over because
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.920]   you know how many times they've been used. You know they're safe. You're going to
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.760]   start with
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.840]   raw meat. I like the raw pack. There are other ways to do it
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.640]   but I like the raw pack. It's easier, it's faster, there's
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.760]   no preparation whatsoever. Literally, you take raw meat
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.200]   and you put it in a jar. That's it.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.360]   You can put a little bit of salt in there if you want. I'm going to suggest
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.400]   that you don't put anything else in the meat. You'll want to experiment. You'll want to
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.680]   make chicken noodle soup.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.760]   You'll want to do all kinds of things with gravy and beef. Please don't. There are a
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.960]   lot of foods that
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.000]   aren't safe for home canning. Rice,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.560]   dairy products, flour,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.760]   there's a lot of things that aren't safe.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.840]   So if you just do meat and I don't even put spices in mine,
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.240]   just salt. If you'll do that, you know your meat will be safe
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.800]   and you can always add those ingredients later when you're cooking your meal.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.120]   So just do the meat. So we have the meat in the jar.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.520]   You've got a pan on your stove that you're boiling
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.320]   the lids. You're going to soften this little rubber gasket here
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.840]   and that is going to, after they've been maybe, you know,
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.040]   two or three minutes, the meat's in here. Make sure the rim of your jar is very
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:40.600]   clean.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.800]   There's no grease or anything on there. You'll put your lid on
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.120]   and you'll put your ring on and you put it on finger tight.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.640]   For my husband that's a whole lot tighter than for me, so
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.360]   finger tight. Now you're going to come to your canner and you've got about three
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.000]   inches of water in your canner
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.760]   and you've got a tray in the bottom of it.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.840]   Don't put your bottles directly in the bottom of the canner.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.040]   They have to sit on a tray. So you put your tray in there and then you've got your
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.200]   bottles. If you're doing pints, you can, this is a
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.360]   921 canner, you can do about
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.160]   17 to 19 pint jars. The quart jar
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.480]   will hold two pounds of meat. The pint jar will hold one pound.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.600]   If you have a big family, you're going to want to have these
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.160]   and it'll hold seven. They do have one at the
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.240]   930 and it will stack quarts.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.880]   I've always wanted one of those. It will stack quarts double high so you can put
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.840]   14
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.920]   quart jars in there. That's 28 pounds of meat in
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.360]   one cooking, one shot. So if you've got pints,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.760]   you can stack them. You put the first layer in
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:49.360]   and then you need another tray that you put on top of that
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.320]   and then start stacking the second layer. If you don't have another tray,
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.800]   if you bought this secondhand and there's not another tray,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.440]   then you're going to want to stack them, but don't
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.680]   stack them on top. Do a stagger like that
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.600]   so that they're not sitting right on top. And from there, put your lid on
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.840]   and what you're going to do next
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.680]   is called exhausting the canner. You turn the heat on high
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.720]   and after 10-15 minutes, just depends on how hot
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.840]   your stove runs, you're going to see steam coming out of your exhaust valve here
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.920]   and eventually you'll see water spitting out of it.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.640]   When you get to that point about five minutes after you've had water spitting
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.040]   out,
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.000]   what you're doing is exhausting the canner that's pulling the air out of the
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.640]   canner
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.520]   and out of the jars. So it's an important process. Don't skip that process.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.960]   And then if we're cooking in the desert, 10 pounds of pressure, I'm going to put this
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.480]   weight
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.920]   on at 10 pounds and immediately my gauge is going to start going up.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.840]   When it gets to 10, or if you're doing in the mountains, whatever the
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.040]   altitude is, when you get to the right pressure,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.320]   then you start timing. If you've got pints, it's 75 minutes. If you've got
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.960]   quarts,
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.600]   it's 90 minutes. And if you've got fish, you add 15 minutes to both of those.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.680]   You've got 90 minutes going.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.400]   Right away you're going to have to turn down the heat, otherwise it's going to go
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.000]   too high.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.280]   So right away you're turning down the heat and during the entire 90 minutes
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.960]   you're going to continue turning that heat down to keep it at 10 pounds of pressure.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.000]   Here's what happens if you walk away and it gets up to 13
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.480]   and you run in and you turn it down and it goes down to 8 and you turn it up again.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.960]   What's happening inside your canner? You didn't put any water
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.560]   in with that meat. The raw pack, there's no water. It makes its own juice.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.720]   It's this great
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.920]   broth that's being made.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.840]   And when the temperature goes too high,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.760]   a vacuum effect actually pulls the juices out of your jars.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.720]   So if you keep it at a steady 10 pounds of pressure, you're going to keep all
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   those juices in there.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.960]   When you're done, you take the lid off,
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.520]   take the jars out, put them on a counter away from a cool draft.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.640]   Eventually you're going to hear that lovely little plink sound
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.360]   and they've all sealed. If you have one, occasionally you'll have one that won't seal,
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.760]   go ahead and put it in the refrigerator and have it later that night or you can
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.760]   reprocess it
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.560]   but you'll have to use a new lid. It will be double processed but it's still great
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.200]   in a soup.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.800]   And wipe them off when they're all cooled. Wipe them off, put them in the box,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.720]   date them, date them, and put them away.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.240]   So that was a long way of saying meat goes in the jar,
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.360]   jar goes in the canner, cook, take it out,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.920]   market, put it away. It could not be
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.600]   simpler. If you've ever done fruits or vegetables, you're going to be thrilled
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.080]   at how much easier and faster it is to do meats.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.640]   I did an experiment one day, I had three canners, two were on the stove and I
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.680]   would keep one filled
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.160]   and I put up a hundred and fifty pounds of chicken
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.000]   in 12 hours. So you could easily do
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.320]   50 pounds in a day. Easy with one canner.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.400]   Yes? Are there any meats that you shouldn't can?
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.080]   There are.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.920]   It's not that you can't can them, you know, if you can catch it you can can it.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.080]   You don't want to do any processed meats,
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.520]   hot dogs, bologna, turkey ham,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   anything like that. You just don't want to do that, it turns out really mushy.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.720]   Hamburger, I used to do hamburger
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.560]   and I didn't like how it was kind of a pasty texture.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.920]   Now you can do ground meats but you're going to want to
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.040]   brown them first. Sausage, I do have sausage in my food storage.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.800]   So I will brown that meat first and then put it in a jar,
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.920]   kind of loosely put it in a jar and add hot water to it
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.320]   and then process it like you normally would. But when
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.200]   when hamburger went up in price, I decided that there wasn't anything in my food
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:54.720]   storage
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.760]   that wouldn't taste better with shredded meat than it would with hamburger.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.400]   So I pretty much stopped doing hamburger. Another idea is
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.440]   you know after Thanksgiving you're taking all the meat off the leftover turkey and
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.920]   you put it in a baggie and you stick it in the fridge and three or four days later you stick it in the freezer
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.360]   and
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.720]   about six months later you throw it away because it's freezer burn. You've all done that.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.280]   What you're going to want to do now is just take the meat off the bone,
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   put it in your jar, add the hot water on top of it
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.600]   because you've already cooked the juices out of it so it won't make its own juice, but you
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.680]   add hot water to that
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.000]   and process it like you would normally. The same amount of time, everything.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.720]   And that will just be a nice chicken soup type of meat.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.800]   And you might want to mark on it that it was leftovers,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.280]   that it wasn't raw pack. So the rotation of meats.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.520]   Any other questions about cooking meats? There's always
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.400]   questions about the meat. Yes? Is it safe to bottle meats on a glass top stove?
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.360]   If you buy a new canner, it's actually going to say do not bottle,
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.440]   do not use a glass top stove. And I kind of
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.040]   wondered about that but I found the reason was, there's two reasons.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.520]   It's quite heavy and when it's full of meat it's got to be even heavier
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.600]   and if you were to accidentally set that down too hard it could crack the glass
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.560]   top stove. So you have to be careful with that.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.280]   But I think the biggest reason is the diameter of your burner
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.000]   is usually quite a bit smaller than the diameter of your canner
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.200]   and as it gets hot that heat radiates out
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.920]   and it can discolor your stove. I have done
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.160]   literally hundreds of pounds of
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.560]   meat on my glass top stoves. I've had three glass top stoves
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.920]   different homes and I've never had a problem. But I
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.240]   I think it's a good idea to warn you about that and you use your own
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.920]   discretion on that.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.600]   Rotating meats. That's kind of hard because you know
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.920]   I say it's easy and it is easy but when it's done
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.840]   you know it's almost like gold. You're just looking at this chicken and you're going
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.040]   "Oh this is so good" and you just think "I don't want to use it, that's my food storage."
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.200]   Please use it. You are going to be so
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.320]   excited about how nice this is to come home
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.440]   and you open this up and you've got instant chicken enchiladas, you've got a
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.080]   chicken salad sandwich, you've got
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.520]   green chili burros. It goes on and on forever
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.760]   and it's a 15-minute dinner so the convenience
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.160]   is going to be really nice in your daily life. So you want to rotate it.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.400]   Also if you keep it for a really long time it's going to, again, like all the
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.680]   other foods, it will lose its nutritional value
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.960]   and it's just better to use it up. So here's
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.880]   a good rotational system. If you're going to have a meat dish in
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.200]   all of your daily, you know one meat dish every day,
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.800]   365 meat dishes, you're going to eventually
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.880]   bottle up, you know if you can do 50 pounds a day you could have
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.880]   all your food storage done in about a week. So you bottle it all up,
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.320]   you date it, you put it under the bed. You have two choices. You can
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.240]   bottle up 50 more pounds and put that in your kitchen pantry
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.400]   or you can take 50 pounds out from your food storage
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   and put that in your kitchen pantry. But the idea is that you want it in your
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.000]   pantry.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.640]   If you use two bottles a week, that 50 pounds will be gone
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.160]   in about six months. And you will have, then when it's gone,
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.880]   you know that you've done 25 beef, 25 chicken, whatever it is.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.080]   You bottle up 50 more pounds, put that under the bed,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.400]   take out 50 more pounds, put it in the kitchen pantry. It's just this nice,
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.080]   like a free ride that you get to take it out of your pantry.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.440]   It's not coming out of your food storage. So you take it out
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.000]   and just do that rotation. Two bottles a week, you will have your entire food
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.520]   storage,
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.160]   the 365 jars, rotated in about three years.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.480]   If you really like it and you want to use three bottles a week,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.080]   you'll have it rotated in about two years. So please
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.560]   use the meat. I think you're going to be really excited about it. And
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.680]   don't be afraid of it. I've heard stories about
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.160]   Aunt Ethel maiming six of her children with the pressure canner and
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.600]   they're all just scared to death of it. It's very, very safe, especially the new
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.400]   ones. They've got
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.960]   every safety precaution there is. It's a fabulous way
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.440]   of putting real foods, real meals,
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.080]   into your food storage. Now, if you
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.840]   have a bowl of beans or you have a bowl of chili and cornbread,
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:25.080]   the only difference is your spices. Spices are going to make or break your
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:25.880]   food storage.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.480]   So don't forget to get your spices. Buy them by the pound.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.280]   They're going to be a lot cheaper if you buy them by the pound. I think you can get a
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   pound of cinnamon for about three dollars
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.840]   if you buy it in bulk. And what I do is I just bring it home,
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.240]   I'll take out what I need for my food storage and I'll vacuum seal that.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.480]   And then that goes in my food storage and the rest goes in my pantry.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.360]   And if it's vacuum sealed, you shouldn't have any problem rotating
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.640]   every five years. It would be an easy rotation. You might
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.600]   even be able to go longer. But don't forget your spices. That's really important.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.320]   One of my favorite sources of alternative fuel is the solar oven.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.040]   Solar cooking is used all over the world. In India alone,
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.560]   there are hundreds of thousands of solar ovens being used.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.440]   This is a clean heat. It keeps the heat
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.840]   out of the kitchen. It tastes
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.840]   really good. They've actually done tests and they found that solar cooked food
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.720]   wins out over all of the other sources of fuel,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.080]   your regular cooking. And it's a free source of fuel.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.160]   You're using the sun. If the sun is shining, it's going to work. You set it out in your
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.840]   backyard,
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.000]   open it up, within 20 to 30 minutes you're going to have a 350 degree oven.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.840]   And you can cook almost anything in an oven that hot.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.080]   I've cooked rice and pastas and casseroles.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.840]   It bakes bread beautifully. It browns it. It makes a beautiful loaf of homemade bread.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.080]   There are three kinds of solar ovens. You've got the simple box oven.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.240]   You've got the parabolic solar cooker. And that is
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.040]   a circle of mirrors. It's pretty complicated. And then you've got
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.600]   the panel cooker. And my favorite is the panel cooker. This is the Global Sun Oven.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.520]   I really like this one. It's my favorite. Process, you set it out there.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.040]   And you've got the panels. This is very easy to open.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.800]   It just opens like that. These panels will catch the light
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.760]   and it will shoot it into the oven. Inside,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.280]   you've got a glass door. And the glass door
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.400]   is on a rubber gasket, a heavy rubber gasket. And that keeps the seal
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.040]   in the oven. It's also got a rocker arm inside.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.440]   And that keeps the food level if you have to move the oven around.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.880]   So it's going to keep that food level. It won't spill. And then there's actually a
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.680]   temperature gauge up here in the corner. So you're going to know when your oven is
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.440]   hot enough.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.840]   It's easy to close up.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.720]   Just like that. I keep my solar cooker on a
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.000]   rolling cart so that as I'm moving it around
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.320]   it's not going to spill the food. That just makes it a little easier to follow
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.920]   the sun.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.120]   Cooking with a solar oven takes about twice as long
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.720]   as it would normally. If it takes 25 minutes to cook your bread, it's going to
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.440]   take about
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.000]   45 or 50 minutes with solar cooking. If you have a large amount of food,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.760]   you want to, instead of putting it in one big pan, you want to split it up
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.720]   and maybe cut it up into smaller pieces. And it's going to cook faster that way.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   Cookware. You want to buy your oven first
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.440]   and then get your cookware. Because you don't want to buy a pan that's not going to
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.920]   fit.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.680]   You can have Dutch ovens if you'd like to use those. That's really good for that
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.800]   occasional cloudy day. The sun comes out and goes behind a cloud.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:40.120]   A Dutch oven takes a little longer to heat up, but it will hold on to the heat
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.440]   so that when the sun goes behind the cloud it's going to keep that food hot
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.880]   so that it's safe. Another type of cookware is you want to have
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.760]   metal. You want to have dark metal, thin metal that's going to
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.360]   heat up very quickly. And you want to have tight-fitting lids. That's going to keep
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.120]   the moisture inside your foods
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:00.400]   so that you've cooked spaghetti on top of a stove and you see all that steam coming up.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.480]   When you cook in a solar oven, you've got that tight-fitting lid.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.440]   You don't lose that moisture. So you actually use less water
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.560]   when you're cooking with solar because that moisture stays inside.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.840]   There are a lot of things that you can do with a solar oven besides just cooking
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.360]   food.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.240]   You can pasteurize water. You can kill infestations of grain or other foods.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.280]   You can sanitize dishes or dry firewood.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   You can sprout foods. And you can decrystallize jams or honey.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Honey is one of those foods that has a very long shelf life,
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.080]   but it will go hard. As it gets old, it goes hard, it crystallizes.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.120]   I used to buy honey in the big buckets,
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.720]   and now I buy it in the small five or six pound
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.200]   jars. And that will fit inside my solar oven because
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   if it's gone hard and if it's crystallized,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.320]   heat will bring it back. So I just pop it in a solar oven
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.040]   and you're able to bring back that honey. For those of you who are interested, a
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.920]   solar oven
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.000]   will cost about $200. And I need to warn you that you're not going to be able to
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.840]   go on the websites and get them
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.160]   used or discounted because once people buy these,
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.960]   they pretty much keep them. So if you go in with a group,
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.000]   sometimes you can get a discount that way with a solar oven.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.600]   So this is one of my favorite alternative sources of fuel.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.120]   And my other one is called the rocket stove. I was teaching a class
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.920]   in Portland a few months ago, and they weren't really interested in the solar
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.360]   oven,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.160]   as you can imagine.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.960]   And they were doing demonstrations on a rocket stove.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.040]   Just the name is so cool. The guys are going, "Rocket stove!"
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.680]   They were showing rocket stoves. And a rocket stove
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.840]   is great because you're going to be able to get
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.320]   a very hot, almost smokeless fire.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.840]   And because of the design of the rocket stove, it concentrates the heat
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.440]   and it burns the fuel more efficiently. So you're going to use 75%
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.560]   less fuel than you would if you were just making a fire.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.160]   They're really great. You can buy them for about $40 or $50.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.680]   You can buy it already made, or you can make your own. And I guarantee the guys
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   are going to want to make them.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.200]   When I was in New Mexico, a guy had made one out of a propane tank.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.240]   And he had welded all this cool stuff on it. It looked like it was going to take off.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.520]   It was a rocket. My husband and I made a double burner
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.720]   rocket stove. We used five-gallon metal cans.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.080]   And we put the stove pipe inside, and we have an oven grate on the top. And it's
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.320]   just really cool.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.320]   Less than $20. You can make them for under $20 very easily.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.680]   I brought one that you can make for free. And the instructions how to make this are
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   in the booklet.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   But I'm going to walk you through it in case my instructions aren't very clear.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.000]   You need a number 10 can and four soup cans.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.600]   And then some kind of insulation, maybe ashes or vermiculite or something.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.720]   But you're going to start with the number 10 can, and you're going to take the lid off
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.160]   and save the lid. And then you're going to cut a hole
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.560]   in the edge, in the side of the can, the size of your tomato soup can.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.600]   So that it just fits inside. Now you want to make it
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.680]   almost exactly the right size because
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.520]   if you don't, you'll have your ashes coming out the edges here. So
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.960]   I use, get some of these nice little tin snips that have the curve to them.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.080]   And cut it kind of small and then keep cutting to make it
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.360]   just right. So that it's going to be the right size. You're going to take your first
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.480]   soup can, and you're going to take just the lid off.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.720]   And cut a hole the size of the can
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   in the side of that. Take your second can, cut the top
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.640]   and the bottom off, and that's going to fit inside of that first can.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.760]   And that's the beginning of your elbow. You're going to take your third soup can,
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.960]   cut the top and the bottom off, and cut it a little bit shorter.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.600]   And then you're going to pinch it just enough so that it fits inside
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.120]   of your first can. And that's the elbow.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.600]   This is going to fit inside the can, and this
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.680]   part of the elbow is going to come out of this hole. That's your elbow. And you
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.440]   want that to be just below
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.480]   the lid of your number 10 can. Then you're going to take your fourth can.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   I'm sorry, you cut this one, the top and the bottom, and you cut it up the side
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.640]   so that you can pinch that together. Then you're going to take your fourth can, and you're
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.320]   going to
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.680]   take out the top and the bottom, cut it up the side, and then flatten it out.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.240]   And you're going to be making a shelf to put inside
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.360]   the elbow. And I like to make mine in just a bit of a T shape
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.280]   so that it doesn't go all the way in. This is the shelf where your wood goes.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.480]   You put your wood here. This is your airflow.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.040]   And because of the design, your airflow goes through here. You put a piece of paper,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.520]   light the match, and the wood catches on fire. And
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.880]   you're going to be amazed at the size of the flame that comes shooting out of here.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.320]   So what you've got is, you put it through here.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.560]   And then
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.720]   your lid, you're going to also cut the size of your
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:04.760]   soup can so that that goes over the top of it, over the vermiculite or the ashes,
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.360]   and it will sit on top of that. And that's where you've got the top of the
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.240]   elbow coming out.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.320]   Now I was able to, with
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.240]   a handful of twigs and sticks, it wasn't even
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.360]   real wood, it was just twigs and sticks, I brought two cups of water to a boil
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.440]   and boiled it for 20 minutes. So you can imagine,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.560]   it wouldn't take a lot of wood for you to have a year's supply
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:33.680]   of wood if you're using a rocket stove. Two reasons you want to have this. If you
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.520]   live in Portland,
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.640]   definitely. And if you live anywhere else,
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.160]   I found that I was really excited about having a rocket stove because
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.880]   I'm putting foods back into my food storage that I had taken out
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.560]   because I couldn't cook it in a solar oven. I was just kind of the blinders,
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.400]   like if it won't
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.600]   cook in a solar oven, then I can't have it.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.040]   Knowing that I don't have to have cords of wood in my backyard,
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.800]   with just a handful of twigs, I put back in pancakes
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.480]   in my breakfast. I put in tortillas so that I can make
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.560]   homemade tortillas and enchiladas and different things.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:12.080]   Fry bread, chili and fry bread was one of my favorite meals, and I put that back in
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:12.920]   my food storage.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.800]   So besides being able to cook a full dinner on a cloudy or rainy day,
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.680]   I have put foods back into my storage that I had taken out before.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:26.360]   So rocket stoves, get online. In the booklet or on my blog, I've got several
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.440]   locations that you can go to that are going to give you detailed instructions
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.560]   on how to make large ones.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.160]   They make them as big as you can imagine to heat a whole house,
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.840]   or you can make them out of a number 10 can. The design is the same,
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.040]   the technology is the same, it's just the size and
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.080]   like the guy in New Mexico, how crazy you want to get with it,
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.440]   you can do just about anything with your rocket stoves. The next thing I have
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.800]   is water. If your electricity is out,
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.400]   if it's city water, you're not going to have water because you have to have
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.520]   electricity to get the water out of the ground.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:03.320]   So you have to store water. I keep my water in the 55 gallon barrels,
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.400]   and if you go to the blog,
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.760]   the Everything Under the Sun blog.blogspot.com,
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.080]   you'll see a water barrel holder that is to die for.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.440]   It's just great. It allows you to lay your barrels on the sides,
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.480]   and it'll stack two or three tall, so you're saving a lot of space
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.720]   by having the water barrels stacked tall, and you're not going to have to worry
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.360]   about that little plastic pump
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.880]   that you know is going to break within the first week of using it.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.040]   If it's lying on its side, one of the lids, you take the lid out,
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.640]   and it's a perfect fit for a faucet, just the kind that you get
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.680]   at the hardware store. So now you just
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.120]   turn on the faucet, and you've got your water. When you're filling the barrels and
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.200]   emptying the barrels,
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.720]   all you need is a hose. You don't have to,
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.200]   when you're emptying it, you don't have to dump them over. You just turn on the
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:53.760]   faucet.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.800]   When you're emptying and filling your water, please don't use your garden hose.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.280]   You have no idea
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.440]   what is inside that hose. You don't want it in your water. Go ahead and go to the
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.760]   hardware store and get what's called a potable
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.160]   water hose, P-O-T-A-B-L-E, and that will keep your water clean.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.320]   Any questions about storing water?
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.440]   Yes? Do you put bleach in your water, and how often do you rotate it?
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.560]   I used to put bleach in my water, and
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.760]   I used to rotate it every six months.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.040]   Not too long ago, we know some people that work
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.160]   in the city water systems, and they're saying that
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.200]   most city water supplies have enough chlorine in them that you don't have to
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:34.960]   add bleach,
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.000]   which I was really happy about, because I really hated that bleach taste in my water.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.120]   So, they have enough bleach in the city system, you don't have to add it,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.720]   and it should stay safe for a year. So we empty our water barrels
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.240]   once a year, and we'll just write on the end of the barrel when we
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.720]   emptied it out last.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.880]   Yeast is one of those have-to-have foods for me.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.520]   I can't imagine how depressing it would be to be eating a bowl of boiled wheat,
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.960]   knowing I could have had homemade bread. If you don't have yeast,
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:12.040]   you're going to be eating boiled wheat. Yeast will last for at least
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.160]   five years in your freezer. So, just
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.920]   you've got, this is what I buy, it's usually vacuum sealed,
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.880]   and I just put that in the freezer, and every five years
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.920]   I'll just rotate it out and buy new. So,
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.400]   yeast have-to-have food, be sure and get that.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.280]   White wheat is something I discovered not too long ago. White wheat,
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.120]   if you're not a big fan of whole wheat bread, the turkey red hard wheat,
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.600]   sometimes people think it's a little too heavy,
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:45.280]   maybe the flavor's a little bit too strong. If you've never tried white wheat,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.840]   I think you're going to like it. It's got a lighter color, lighter
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.400]   texture, and a lighter flavor than whole wheat.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.560]   It's almost like you've taken white flour and wheat flour and
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.520]   combine them, and it's great, especially if you're going to be doing cinnamon rolls
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.120]   or things like that in your food storage.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.440]   You want to have that white wheat, and it has the same
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.880]   nutritional content, moisture content,
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.920]   the price is the same, the shelf life is the same,
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.640]   so if you haven't tried white wheat, you might want to try that.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.800]   Now, speaking of wheat, they've
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.840]   done kind of a research on people who
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.160]   do have food storage, and they found that of that small amount of people
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:30.040]   that have food storage, 90 percent of them did not have
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.840]   a wheat grinder. And they kind of smile and think, "Well,
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.640]   you guys are going to be eating boiled wheat, and I'm going to be having homemade bread,
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.160]   because
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.200]   I definitely have a wheat grinder." You'll want to get a hand grinder first,
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.520]   just in case there's no electricity, and then maybe get
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.880]   an electric grinder, because you're going to want to practice making homemade bread
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.840]   if you haven't done it.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.040]   The booklet is going to tell you information on where to get them,
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.320]   the best kinds, and the research that's been done,
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.680]   and what they're going to cost. So get your wheat grinder.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.080]   Technology has given us the ability
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.240]   to have so many foods
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.920]   in our food storage. If you're not a real fan
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.360]   of powdered milk, you can actually have real milk.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.480]   This is shelf-stable milk that sits on your counter,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.760]   and it's good for at least a year. If you are
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:24.320]   a fan of butter and cheese,
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.480]   you can actually... I used to bottle my own butter, and I don't do that anymore.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.840]   I had a high failure rate, and I discovered that you can buy
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.120]   canned butter, and this has an extremely long
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.520]   shelf life. I don't know what that means. I'm thinking
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.840]   almost indefinite. They won't say that, but they do say extremely long. So you can
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.960]   buy canned butter
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.800]   and canned cheese that will sit on your shelf, and you've got a really long shelf
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.560]   life with that.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.720]   If there are no other questions,
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.880]   I'd like to thank you for coming to the class. I hope that
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.040]   I've been able to answer your questions about food storage,
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.240]   and I hope I've been able to motivate you and get you excited
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   with a new attitude about getting prepared. Thank you.
