[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.440]   are to be found in the book of the prophet Isaiah in the 40th chapter.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.480]   And reading tonight from verse 25 to verse 28.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.560]   The 40th chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah, verses 25 to 28.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.000]   "To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal, saith the Holy One?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.680]   Lift up your eyes on high, and behold, who hath created these things,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.120]   that bringeth out their host by number?
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.200]   He calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.640]   for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.520]   Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.080]   My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed from my God?
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.920]   Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.800]   the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not?
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.720]   Neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding."
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.640]   Now we are considering here one of those further answers
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.760]   that the prophet gives us in this chapter to the query
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.360]   that arises in the minds of men and women
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.160]   when they are brought face to face with the declaration
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.120]   of the great and merciful promises of God.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120]   We are looking at this great and mighty chapter,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   one of the most moving in the whole of the Bible, for the eleventh time.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.840]   And for the sake of those who may not have been present on previous occasions,
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.400]   may I indicate to you the way in which we have been expounding it
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.960]   in order that you may see exactly where these verses that we are looking at tonight come in.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.200]   Our understanding of the chapter can be put in this way very hurriedly.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.320]   In the first eleven verses, the pronouncement, the proclamation of the gospel is made.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.160]   It's one of those great Old Testament prophecies
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.480]   of the coming of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.680]   and of how he comes, and of what he's going to do.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.320]   You'll find it verified and quoted in the New Testament.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.760]   Very well there is the gospel. The gospel in its essence is this,
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.560]   that into this world of sin and shame and of rebellion against God,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   this world that has reduced itself to chaos
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.960]   because of men's disobedience and turning away from God,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.040]   the announcement is that God himself is going to intervene.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.440]   That when men have tried and men have failed,
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.720]   God still looks upon us with mercy and with love and with compassion.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.920]   And the proclamation he makes is that he's going to send into this world his only begotten Son.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.880]   He's going to send this great personage,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.080]   who is so great that he needs a special way to be made for him.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.920]   And who is he? Well, this is the message, "Behold your God."
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.400]   There he is, the Saviour of the world, God the Son.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.280]   And we are given this extraordinary description of him
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.560]   in his dual character of the mighty conqueror,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.440]   and yet the tender, gentle shepherd that picks up the lambs,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.640]   and is so gentle in the way he leads those that are with young.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.880]   There is the great proclamation of the gospel.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.720]   But now, when that proclamation was first made,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.360]   the children of Israel found it very difficult to believe it.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.160]   The world still finds it difficult to believe it.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.640]   That's why the vast majority of people in the world tonight are not Christian,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.400]   and not only don't believe it, but reject it with scorn, and regard it even as an insult.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.960]   Well, in the remainder of the chapter, the prophet takes up these difficulties
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.520]   that people say that they have, and he raises them and he answers them.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.040]   There's only one ultimate answer to all these questions, and that is,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.560]   that men have such a faulty and wrong conception of God,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.880]   that any of their particular thinking about him is of necessity wrong.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.160]   So, the prophet starts off at once by issuing that great challenge,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.320]   "Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught him,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   with whom took he counsel, and who instructed him,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.200]   and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge."
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.760]   In other words, the great stumbling block that people fall over
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.680]   as they come to consider the gospel of Christ is,
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.760]   that they think that their minds and their philosophies are big enough to spend this gospel.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.480]   They haven't realized that the first thing we have to do
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   when we come face to face with the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.120]   is to obey the injunction of the Apostle Paul, which he puts in these words,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.640]   "If any man be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be made wise."
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.240]   The first thing to say as you confront the gospel is this great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.760]   And any man who thinks he can understand it is doomed to failure before he goes any further.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.880]   The prophet takes up that argument and he answers it in that way, we've considered it.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.000]   But then there is a second difficulty.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.960]   Men have got this false notion of God because they will persist in thinking of God
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.560]   in terms of their own gods.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.440]   There it is, he takes it up and starts dealing with that at verse 18 and goes on to verse 24,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.800]   "To whom then will he liken God, or what likeness will he compare unto him?"
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.760]   And then he takes up the graven images, the idols that men make themselves and then proceed to worship.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.520]   And they think that God is like that, and he ridicules it.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.000]   In other words, last Sunday night we spent our evening in examining that.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.800]   And we saw that here we have one of those tremendous exposures of unbelief.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.400]   And we saw that the prophet, as the Bible does everywhere,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.480]   exposes the unutterable folly of unbelief.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.760]   That people can believe in idols they've made themselves, but say they can't believe in God.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.680]   What utter folly unbelief is.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.800]   "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.760]   A man who says there is no God is a fool, he's foolish.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:18.200]   He has his own gods, he believes in them, and yet he rejects the almighty and eternal God.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.880]   In the same way, you remember that he went on to show how,
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.200]   in every respect, this unutterable folly manifests itself.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.880]   He works it out, this faith that men have in the princes and in the judges of the earth,
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.440]   all of which is but as vanity.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.040]   They don't seem to realize that, and they don't realize the greatness of God's power.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.880]   "But it's ignorance," he says, "it's nothing but ignorance because God has given evidence of himself."
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.000]   He's given it in nature.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.920]   He's given it in nature by just creating the world.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.640]   "It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain."
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.720]   "You have no excuse for this ignorance," says the prophet, "look at nature."
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.560]   And then he takes up the argument of history, what God has done in history.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.840]   He mentions these princes and these judges, these great men, but this is what he says,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.920]   "Yea, they shall not be planted, yea, they shall not be sown, yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth."
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.120]   "He shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither." And the history of the Bible is just an illustration of all that.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.280]   And so is subsequent world history.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.640]   Very well then, he's dealt with these problems and difficulties.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.880]   But here in this section that we're looking at tonight, he comes to yet another difficulty.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:58.200]   You know, my friends, we shall be without any excuse at all on the eternal day of judgment if we are not Christians.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.160]   Because the Bible not only gives us its message, it even helps us to believe it.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.600]   It answers your difficulties before you were ever born.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.480]   They're all here. I don't hesitate to make this a separation from this pulpit tonight.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.360]   There is never a difficulty that any man has ever thought of with regard to believing the gospel,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.000]   but that it's already dealt with and answered in the scriptures.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.440]   Now here is another of them tonight. What's the difficulty here?
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:36.920]   Well, the difficulty here is this difficulty concerning God's ways.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:48.040]   It's the difficulty of understanding God's purposes and promises in the light of things that are happening in the world.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:54.600]   In other words, it's a doubting of God's ability and of his goodness.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   That's the particular problem which is dealt with here.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.720]   Of course, it's just another illustration, I say, of the great central difficulty of not being clear about the being of God,
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.480]   as I'm going to show you in a moment.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.520]   But that central difficulty manifests and expresses itself in different ways.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.440]   And there is none, perhaps, that is quite so common as this one.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.600]   It's summarized for us in verse 27. Listen again.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:28.840]   The prophet addresses the people and he says, "Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel,
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:37.080]   my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God?"
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   Now, what does that mean? Well, it means this.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:47.400]   It isn't a statement on the part of Israel and of Jacob that they can do what they like and God won't see it.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.680]   That is true. Incidentally, they did believe that kind of thing, but that isn't what's being said here.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.560]   This is a complaint, rather, and it's a complaint along these lines.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.680]   Israel says, "Why am I having such a difficult time?
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.760]   God has always told us that we are his people. Very well, if we are his people, why does he allow us to suffer?
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.880]   Why are things going against us?
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.000]   Why has my judgment passed over from my God?"
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.200]   Which means this, you see, that they were beginning to doubt God's goodness.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.120]   They couldn't quite make up their minds as to what was the real explanation.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:31.560]   Was it that God was not able to do anything for them, or was it that God really didn't care what happened to them?
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.200]   They say, "Where is God's righteousness? Where is his judgment? He says that he's a just God.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.800]   Well, is this a fair way of dealing with us?" That's the question that they ask.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.440]   In view of their circumstances and certain things that they could see,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.960]   they had been questioning the power of God and the goodness of God.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.320]   Now, there is no doubt at all that there are large numbers of people tonight outside the church and outside Christ
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.480]   for just this very reason.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.760]   That they say that they cannot reconcile the things that they know and the things they see
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.280]   with the claims that are made in the Bible for God and for his character.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.840]   It's an old problem, this, and a very persistent one.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:23.080]   You'll find it dealt with on innumerable occasions in the scriptures themselves.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.840]   It's almost a standing complaint in the book of Psalms.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:32.440]   The children of Israel were always ready to grumble and to complain in this way whenever things went wrong with them.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.320]   They never say this sort of thing while things are going well, of course.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.960]   When things were going well, they just forget God altogether.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.160]   But when things go wrong, they turn back and say, "Now, is this fair?
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.480]   Where is God? Is God just in doing this? Is God not able to deliver us? What is happening?"
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   And it's dealt with repeatedly.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.160]   But, see, it is as common a difficulty and as common a complaint tonight
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.200]   as it was in the Old Testament times and in the New Testament times.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.640]   It's always been brought up by people as a difficulty.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.080]   They say they'd like to believe the gospel, but they say, "We just can't."
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   They say, "Now, there are all those promises of God
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.120]   and all the great claims of your gospel, and yet look at the world."
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:24.920]   They say, "If God is God and if God is what the Bible says He is, how can these things be?"
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.880]   They say, "Look at the innocent suffering
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:35.160]   and look at the people who are evil and ungodly and selfish, flourishing and having a thoroughly good time."
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.280]   They say, "The way of godliness doesn't seem to pay in a world like this.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.760]   Look at the injustices. Look at the cruelty.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   Look at the people who are born perhaps blind or lame or something like that."
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.040]   Now they say, "I can't believe in the God of your Bible when I see things like that."
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.240]   That's the sort of argument.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:03.560]   This querying and doubting of God's goodness, of God's justice, of God's righteousness, of God's benevolence.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.960]   And then they say, "Look at this problem of war.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.800]   Why does God allow war?
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.880]   If there is a God, how can He possibly allow such a thing? Why doesn't He stop it?"
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.120]   "You say He's got almighty power," they argue.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.320]   "Well, very well, if He's got the power, why doesn't He exercise it?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.440]   It must be that He's not good."
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.480]   That's what they say.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.760]   And they take up all the statements of the Bible about God one after another and they raise their queries.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.960]   They say, "But look at the first, face the position. It's no use making these great assertions," they say.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.320]   "It's no use telling us about God's exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:46.840]   Where are they and why aren't they being carried out in life?"
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.680]   And they're particularly fond of doing this, of course, with regard to a question like that,
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.200]   the second coming of Christ.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.000]   "Where is the promise of His coming?" they say.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.440]   They were saying it in the New Testament times, you remember.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.640]   The preaching was that this Christ of God had come and He'd worked out this great salvation.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.080]   Yes, He'd returned to heaven and He was seated at the right hand of God
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.360]   until His enemies should be made His footstool, but they said He's going to come again.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.560]   And He's coming to judgment and He's coming to remove out of the world everything that's opposed to God
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.840]   and establish His kingdom, a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:32.680]   "Ah," said the doubters and the skeptics, "that's all right, but where is the promise of His coming?"
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.000]   "It's all very well," they said, "to preach a thing like that, but look at the time that's gone
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.920]   and it's put like this today, isn't it?
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.640]   You've had 2,000 years," they say, "of Christian preaching,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.200]   but the world doesn't seem to be very much better.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.920]   If your gospel is true, why isn't everybody Christian?
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.880]   Why isn't the world delivered from wars and pestilences?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.160]   And where is this return of Christ you're talking about?
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.000]   When is this kind of thing going to happen?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.280]   Is it going to happen?
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.640]   Can God send Him?
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.000]   Does He want to send Him?"
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.960]   Those are the questions.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.240]   Now, that is the problem which is taken up here by the prophet.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.320]   And I want to consider it with you and to show you how, again, face to face with this,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.800]   he has everything to say that we need.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.920]   He has the complete and the perfect answer.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.880]   What is the answer?
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:28.120]   Well, the answer is still the character of God.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.320]   It's always the answer.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.520]   I say again that it is our total and completely inadequate ideas of God
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.400]   and our unworthy conceptions of God that account for all our troubles,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.720]   all our problems, all our difficulties about believing this Christian message.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.200]   We don't understand it.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.280]   That's the trouble.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.200]   God is so great and so different that we stumble at every point.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.920]   We think we can understand, we think we're competent to,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.880]   and we bring our questions and we analyze with our minds,
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.280]   and because God doesn't conform to what we think,
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.720]   we say this is wrong, this can't be true.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:14.760]   My dear friends, it's all I say owing to this tragic inability of men
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.800]   truly to understand the character of God.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   Now, listen to the prophet as he again holds us face to face with God.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.520]   That's all he's got to say by way of answer to this problem
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.360]   as he's answered every other problem.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:36.760]   And he tells us here three things about the character of God.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.320]   Is there anyone, I wonder, I'm sure there is in this congregation
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.760]   who's in trouble at this very point.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.720]   You can't understand God's ways.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.120]   You say you want to believe, you wish you could believe,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.320]   but you say I can't commit intellectual suicide.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.920]   I must know where I stand, I must have some kind of explanation.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.280]   And I'm baffled by the contrast between the claims and what I see and what I know.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.040]   What's the answer of the prophet? Well, here it is.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   He starts by holding us face to face with the holiness of God.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.160]   Listen to him here in the first statement.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.080]   He repeats the challenge which he'd introduced in verse 18.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   Notice the difference between verse 18 and verse 25.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.160]   In verse 18 I read, "To whom then will he liken God,
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.360]   or what likeness will he compare unto him?"
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.680]   In verse 25 I read, "To whom then will he liken me,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.040]   or shall I be equal?
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.080]   Saith the Holy One."
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.360]   You notice the new term.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.160]   The Holy One.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.400]   This is God's description of himself.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   This is the way in which the Bible always refers to him.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.040]   And this is the way in which the Bible always meets us
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.800]   at this particular point of difficulty,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.000]   and the way in which it always answers us.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.800]   It always starts by making this great assertion that God is holy.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.480]   He doesn't argue about this, he proclaims it.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:27.880]   And of course it's just here we find ourselves in our greatest difficulty.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.360]   It is here that we differ most of all from God.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.400]   We cannot conceive of the holiness of God.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.480]   We can't grasp what it means.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:47.400]   And if there is one point more than another at which all our powers and faculties
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.120]   are to be seen for the pygmy things they are,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:57.240]   it is when we try to consider the unutterable holiness of God.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.880]   Our minds boggle at the greatness and the might and the majesty of God, don't they?
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.240]   We feel our measures are too small.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.960]   But it is when we come to this quality of God which is called his holiness,
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.240]   that all our knowledge and philosophy and ability,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.760]   it's all so inadequate, it all just becomes quite useless in our hands.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:25.960]   Why? Well, because God is so essentially different.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.400]   It isn't often I have a good word to say for any kind of modern theology,
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.160]   but there is one emphasis in modern theology which I believe is excellent,
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.960]   and that is that section of it Adunerit,
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:48.520]   which puts great emphasis upon the utter qualitative difference between God and men.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.560]   And if we don't start with that we can never be right anywhere.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.040]   And what is the thing that divides and separates men from God most of all?
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:07.080]   Well, it's just this, it is holiness, it's moral character.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:13.160]   We are separated from God, I say, in every respect, but no, in no respect more than this.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:19.720]   Here, I say, we are face to face with something that's so entirely different from us
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   that we can't begin to understand it.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.280]   And there is nothing to do but to humble ourselves before it and to drop onto our knees
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:32.520]   and to worship Him and to acknowledge that we are undone.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   The Bible, I say, doesn't argue this, it asserts it.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:45.400]   My friends, the main trouble with us all is that we don't know God.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.760]   It isn't our particular problems that constitute the real problem.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.480]   Your problem, you know, is not to understand miracles.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.360]   If you understood God, you'd have no difficulty with miracles.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.720]   All the troubles are due to the fact we don't understand God.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.920]   The categories are too high, they're too great, they're too exalted.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:06.200]   It's God Himself!
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.560]   And what the Bible asserts about God above everything else is this,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.640]   that God is essentially holy.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.200]   That He is the thing that makes God, God.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.720]   He is our unutterable holiness.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.080]   I almost hesitate to preach on such a theme.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.880]   But I'm not here to choose my themes, it's my business to expound the Word.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.280]   And God has been pleased to reveal Himself and His holiness to us.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.240]   That is why He gave the Ten Commandments and the moral law.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.240]   That's the message He gave the prophets.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.040]   That's what He's revealed supremely in His Son.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.600]   That's what the Son taught in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:57.880]   Holiness, holiness unto the Lord.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.520]   The whole message of the Bible, in a sense, is this,
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.080]   "Be ye holy, for I am holy."
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.160]   Listen to what the Bible tells us about God.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:15.560]   It says, "He's light, and in Him is no darkness at all."
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.280]   Can you conceive of that?
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.640]   Where's your mind? Where's your philosophy? Where's your understanding?
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:30.760]   That's God. God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all, none.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:37.560]   Unutterable, unmixed, absolute, eternal light.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:45.960]   That's just a figure of the holiness of God, and it's inadequate.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.560]   He has no connection with evil whatsoever.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.440]   He's of such a pure countenance that He cannot even look upon it.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.480]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.560]   What is God? God is a consuming fire.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   Our God is a consuming fire,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.160]   dwelling in the light that is unapproachable,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.400]   that no man hath ever seen or can see.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:23.000]   That's God. The burning light, says the Bible.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.240]   My dear friends, even the Scriptures themselves
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.120]   are constantly confessing to us that they cannot give us an account of God.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.040]   You see, our language is too small, it's inadequate, it's unworthy,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.320]   and our very terms and categories are polluted by sin,
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.040]   so that in a sense anything we may say about God is detracting from the glory of God.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.840]   Thank God we are given these images, we are given these figures,
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.560]   we are given these comparisons,
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.680]   but they only take us to the threshold of it all.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.280]   God.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.440]   What better can I say than to remind you of this,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.240]   that when His only begotten Son was in this world
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.760]   and took upon Him the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:16.040]   when He prayed to God, He ever said, "Holy Father, holy Father."
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.280]   He knew, and He alone has known on this earth the holiness of God.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.560]   What's it mean? Well, it means unutterable righteousness.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.480]   It means that God is truth, that God is light, as I've been saying,
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.920]   and that everything that God does is controlled by truth, and by right,
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.560]   and by holiness, by justice.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.120]   That is the holiness of God.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.160]   And therefore, you see, it follows, doesn't it, of necessity,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.320]   that the moment you and I begin to try to consider and to understand
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.720]   anything that God does in this world,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   we must always start with this category of holiness.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.600]   Because that is God, well, everything God does
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.640]   partakes of that character and of that quality.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.000]   Though I may not understand many things as a Christian, I say this,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:15.320]   that God is light, and whatever God does is right.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.600]   You must start with that, because everything that God does
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.440]   is colored by that, and controlled by that, and determined by that.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.240]   Well, now then, you see our difficulty, don't you?
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:34.840]   If that is God, and if everything that God does is because he's holy,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.840]   you see, where at once we find ourselves in trouble and in difficulty, don't you?
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:45.160]   Because we are altogether different from that, are we not?
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   You see, we don't start with truth, we start with happiness, don't we?
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.880]   The thing that governs our thinking is selfishness and self-centeredness.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.960]   What we are out for is not absolute truth and justice and righteousness and holiness.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.280]   What we want is ease and comfort.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.080]   We want certain things so that we can enjoy ourselves.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   We are controlled by self-interest,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.680]   and that always thinks in terms of happiness and peace and joy,
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.520]   and we see everything from that angle,
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.560]   and all our decisions are governed from that angle.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.720]   And you see, the clash is inevitable, isn't it?
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.840]   There is God in his holiness, here are we in our sin and unworthiness.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.400]   And because God does everything from the standpoint of holiness,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.280]   we don't understand it and we don't like it.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.680]   Let's be quite frank and honest in our admissions.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.520]   We don't like talk about justice, do we?
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:46.040]   We don't like talk about law, we don't like retribution, we don't like punishment.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.400]   We say if God is love, well then, of course, there mustn't be such a thing as punishment.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.560]   We don't like this law, this idea that God lays down ten commandments and says,
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.080]   "If you don't keep them, I'll punish you."
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.920]   "Oh, we say that's all wrong."
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.520]   Yes, and you know why you say that?
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.200]   Because you're not holy.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.080]   Because you're governed by lust and desire and passion.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.000]   Because you want to have the best of every conceivable world.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.320]   Because you want your own way in everything.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.160]   And because your categories of judgment are all within yourself,
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.600]   and are all self-centered and selfish.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:31.800]   And God is entirely and utterly and absolutely different.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.600]   Oh, I have reminded you already, the children of Israel went into trouble always at that point.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.400]   When everything was going well, they forgot God and turned their backs upon Him.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.880]   But the moment anything went wrong, they turned back and said,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.680]   "Why is God dealing with us like this? What was the matter?"
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.160]   Well, it was this, they never believed that they deserved punishment.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.520]   You see, like every child, human nature, mankind thinks like this.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.560]   "Yes, I've done something that I knew what was wrong, but I don't deserve to be punished for it."
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:07.240]   "And my father or mother's being rather harsh and unkind, why should I be punished?"
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.360]   We've all felt it, we've all said it.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:16.760]   And as human beings face to face with God, we still say it.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.360]   We don't understand the Holy One.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:26.440]   We don't know that all God's ways are holy and righteous and just.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.480]   We are not prepared to say, "Shall not the God of all the earth do right?"
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.880]   Let me show it to you quite plainly, my friends.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.920]   Do you know why people stumble at the doctrine of the Incarnation?
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.600]   Do you know why people say that they can't believe that Jesus of Nazareth was God as well as men?
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.280]   That they say they can't accept this notion of two natures in one person?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.360]   They say their philosophy makes it impossible.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.600]   They can't believe that the Son of God has literally come down to earth and lived amongst us.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.360]   Why do they stumble at the Incarnation? I'll tell you.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.320]   It's rarely because they've never seen the absolute necessity of the Incarnation.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.960]   It's because they've never known what sin is.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.920]   It's because they've never known the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.760]   If they had, they'd realize that nothing but the Son of God could save them.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.000]   Why do people stumble at the cross? Why is the cross an offence?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.760]   I'll tell you why it's an offence.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.000]   It says this, that that was the only way in which God can save mankind.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.880]   Which means this, that you and I and every other person have sinned so deeply and so horribly
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:38.120]   that there is nothing that God can do to forgive us but that.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.160]   And we don't like it.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.840]   Oh yes, we'll believe in Christ as a healer of our bodies.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.600]   We'll believe in Him as a teacher.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.040]   We'll believe in Him as an example.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.200]   But there's one thing that people hate.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:57.400]   And that is when they're told that Christ has died for our sins.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.040]   And that it's by His blood that we are saved.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.480]   It's been said again this last week.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.680]   People don't like it.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.560]   They don't like the blood and the theology of blood.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.440]   Why not?
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.640]   I'll tell you, they don't understand the holiness of God.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   They think that God can wink at sin and pretend He hasn't seen it.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:23.960]   But if God did that, He wouldn't be holy, my friends.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:30.120]   They think that God can put just, just put a cover over sin and make it look respectable.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.880]   Holiness can't do things like that.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:40.360]   So that as we stumble at all the ways of God, all He's done in the world, and all He's done to us,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.120]   let us realize in the first place that all our troubles due to this,
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.760]   that we've no conception of the unutterable holiness of God.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:58.280]   God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.520]   And it's only when you've understood what that means
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.440]   that you're entitled to query and to question what God does.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:12.600]   You need your mind to be cleansed and purified and purged from sin and selfishness
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.840]   and ugliness and foulness.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.560]   You need to have the light of God in you and then you'll begin to understand Him
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.920]   and say with His only begotten Son, "Holy Father,"
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   and worship Him and adore Him even as you stand facing the cross
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.320]   on which you're about to be crucified.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.000]   The holiness of God.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.480]   But let me say just a word about the second thing which the prophet here emphasizes,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:52.040]   which is the changelessness or the immutability of God.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.680]   The changelessness or the immutability of God.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.400]   Oh, again, we're in trouble at this point, aren't we?
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:07.000]   And, of course, it's not surprising that we are in trouble at this point.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.800]   We will persist in thinking of God as if He were just such another as ourselves,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.160]   as the psalmist puts it.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.400]   And we, of course, we get tired.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.400]   We make promises and we don't keep them.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:29.800]   As we become great in this world, we tend to forget details and we tend to forget small people.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.520]   We become so great that we can't be bothered with them.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.720]   We may have been brought up with them, but as we get on and advance,
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.040]   we tend to forget the people we were brought up with.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.200]   We become so great that we are indeed oblivious of their very existence.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:47.560]   That's man, isn't it?
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.800]   And as we get old, our powers begin to fail, and we lose grip,
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.400]   and we can no longer do the things we once did.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.120]   And you see, our trouble arises from the fact that we tend to think that God is like us.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.960]   We make our God in our own image.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.440]   And we tend to think that God gets tired and that God begins to forget,
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.200]   and that God doesn't see us.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.120]   We think that the very argument of His greatness in creation is a proof of that.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.240]   We say, "How can such a great God be interested in just a miserable worm like myself?
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.760]   Is the Lord who plays with the universe as if it were nothing
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.960]   and regards the nations as the small dust of the balance?
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.920]   Is He likely to be interested in me personally?" we ask.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.800]   It's asking the impossible, we say.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:40.600]   And yet your gospel says that.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.920]   That's what these children of Israel were saying.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.440]   They couldn't understand this.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.840]   They say, "God must be getting tired.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.880]   God has forgotten us, and God is no longer just.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.760]   He's promised. He isn't doing it. He's forgotten the promise."
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.040]   What's the answer of the prophet? Well, listen to him.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.360]   "Lift up your eyes on high," he says,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.320]   "and behold, who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number?
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.520]   He calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might,
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:16.280]   for that he is strong in power; not one faileth."
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.560]   Then he goes on again.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:23.000]   "Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God the Lord,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.440]   the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.400]   There is no searching of his understanding."
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.360]   What's it all mean?
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:37.320]   Well, let me summarize it very hurriedly in this way.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:42.200]   What he says is that God never tires.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.280]   That God, I say, is changeless and immutable and eternal.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.840]   He never varies. Indeed, he goes further.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.120]   He says God is incapable of change.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.000]   That is the definition of God.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.440]   "I am that I am. I shall be what I shall be, from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:08.280]   His days do not lengthen. Time writes no wrinkle on the brow of the eternal.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.000]   He's everlastingly, eternally the same.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.960]   He's the source of all power and of all might.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:21.160]   He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.360]   God never tires.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.800]   Hast thou not known, that the everlasting God the Lord,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:32.360]   the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.640]   There can be no change, there is no modification in him.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:41.960]   God as God is everlastingly the same and can never be different."
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.360]   That's the first answer.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:52.600]   The second way he puts it is to say that God is still in control of everything.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.640]   He not only made the world, he sustains the world.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.520]   He gives life and breath and being to everything.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.640]   If he withdraws his spirit, everything dies.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.040]   God is not only the maker and the artificer.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.160]   He sustains by his amazing providence.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.880]   Every one of us would die in a second if God didn't keep us alive.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.920]   That's the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.880]   The stars in the firmament and all the wonders of nature.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.320]   God has his eye upon them all.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.280]   He knows them all.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.560]   He marshals them all.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.320]   He calls them all forth.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.080]   All is in his hands.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.040]   Everything is under his mighty control.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.360]   And he never varies and he never tires.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.800]   He gives out his energy.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.400]   It's not diminished.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:45.880]   It's eternal, everlasting in its source.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.560]   But thank God I've got something still more wonderful to tell you.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.440]   He never gets tired.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.720]   He never worries.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.600]   He never becomes faint.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.200]   He manages the universe.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.080]   Yes, but this is what I like.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.000]   He never forgets.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.040]   And though he's so great, he knows us one by one.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.000]   Listen.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.680]   This man uses this marvelous comparison you remember here.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.000]   "Lift up your eyes," he says on high, "and behold who hath created these things."
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   He's taking you out on a starry night.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.960]   He says, "Look at them all.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.480]   Can you count the stars?"
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.040]   There they are.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.680]   Look at them.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.320]   Do you know, he says, God knows them one by one.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.880]   He calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his power.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:39.480]   Not one of them faileth, though he's so great and so mighty.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.920]   He knows them individually, in detail, one by one.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.040]   The Lord of all and yet the intimate detailed knowledge.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   He never forgets.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.920]   His might and his power are manifested not only in general, but in particular.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:05.160]   There is nothing that I know of in the whole realm of the gospel that is more wonderful
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.960]   than this, that that everlasting and eternal God knows me.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.640]   He's not like the great men of the earth, who forget the small and the insignificant
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.560]   and can't be bothered with details.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:24.920]   Oh yes, he's the center and the soul of every sphere, yet to each loving heart.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.560]   How near.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.960]   Oliver Wendell Holmes was perfectly right.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:38.200]   I see a great and a glorious illustration of this in the life of his dear son, who said,
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.800]   And this is what I find.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.000]   There he is surrounded by a great mob one day, thronged we are told.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.920]   People pressing in upon him.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.760]   He was on a journey and he could scarcely move because of the great crowd.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.360]   He couldn't push his way through it.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.040]   And suddenly he stops and turns round and says, "Who touched me?"
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.920]   He was being touched everywhere.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.720]   He says, "Who has touched me in particular?"
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.680]   He'd felt the hand of a poor woman with an issue of blood, with a desperate need.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.360]   She touched him and he knew it.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:18.120]   The Lord of the universe.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:27.320]   But he knew the woman who had touched him and was aware of her personal problem.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.840]   Still more wonderful do I see him upon the cross,
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:38.520]   bearing in his holy body the sins of the whole world,
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.480]   experiencing the shame and the agony of it all.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.720]   There he is submitting himself.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.240]   And the mighty transaction is going on between the Father and the Son.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.040]   You'd have thought that with such a problem and in such a situation,
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.040]   he'd have time for no one and nothing.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.560]   He's dealing with the cosmos.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:07.480]   But he has time to listen to a thief that's dying at his side.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.080]   And he speaks to him out of the agony and says today,
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   "Thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:27.320]   He not only knows the stars one by one, he knows us one by one.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.680]   Listen to my authority.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.080]   This is what the Lord Jesus Christ said about him.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.960]   He looked at his disciples who were rather frightened and alarmed and nervous
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.080]   and he said, "You needn't be.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.440]   The very hairs of your head are all numbered."
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.400]   This eternal God who sits upon the circle of the earth,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.480]   who spreads out the heavens as a curtain,
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.480]   to whom the inhabitants of the world in general are but as grasshoppers.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.280]   He knows you.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.360]   He's counted the very hairs of your head.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.280]   There's nothing that can happen to you if you're in Christ apart from God.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.800]   Even a sparrow doesn't fall to the ground without God.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.880]   You can't understand this sort of thing.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.480]   Give way to your philosophy.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.000]   Leave it at home, my friend.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.120]   It's too small.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.880]   You can't take in things like this.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.640]   The concepts are too great.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.240]   The Lord of the universe interested in the fall of a sparrow.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:30.280]   The God of heaven taking the trouble to count the hairs of your head because he loves you
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.440]   and because in Christ he's your father.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:43.800]   The holiness of God, the changelessness and the immutability of God.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.600]   And lastly, the eternal wisdom of God.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.160]   There is no searching of his understanding.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.000]   How foolish we are ever to try.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:04.280]   We can't understand what's happening in this world and therefore we question and we query
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.680]   because our minds, I say, are too small.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:12.200]   But the answer of the Bible is that he has his purpose.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:16.360]   He has his plan.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.920]   God sees the end from the beginning.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.760]   All this has been arranged before the very foundation of the world.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.560]   God has a purpose and a plan, I say, and he knows what he's doing.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.080]   He knows the way he taketh.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.240]   You and I don't.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.840]   It seems to be contradictory.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.920]   One thing working this way, the other that way.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.200]   We say, "What is this?"
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.240]   We don't understand.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.040]   God knows.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:45.320]   He sees the end as clearly as he sees the beginning.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.200]   There is no searching of his understanding.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.080]   You see, you and I, with our little minds and understanding,
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.360]   we only see a little segment of history, the one we happen to be living in.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.280]   We say it's the most important period in the history of the world because we are alive.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.600]   Our fathers said that, our grandfathers said it.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.160]   Our selfishness makes us say that our age is always the greatest and the most important.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.440]   We see the little segment and we say, "We don't understand this."
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.200]   My dear friend, if you but put your little segment into the whole,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.800]   you begin to understand a little.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.880]   But you can't do it.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.520]   God can.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.160]   There is no searching of his understanding.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:34.520]   He permits many things which we can't follow, but he knows what he's doing.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.360]   That's why I read to you that great 11th chapter of the epistle to the Romans at the beginning,
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.800]   where Paul, in his own manner, takes up the same argument.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.240]   How do I understand this?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   The children of Israel are the people of God,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.040]   and yet they're rejecting the gospel and the Gentiles are believing.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.240]   Where is God's plan?
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.280]   Are they God's people?
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.160]   That's the question.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.440]   Did you notice his answer?
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   God permits things we don't understand, but God's got a plan.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.200]   It's all perfect.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:04.520]   He's planned it all out, and it's all happening according to the divine program.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:12.280]   It always has happened, and it always will happen.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.680]   A little later on in his prophecy, Isaiah, after God has unfolded a little of the plan to him,
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.520]   bursts out and says this,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.720]   "Verily," he says, "Thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.040]   I see now, I couldn't see it before, you're hiding your bright designs,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.560]   and I, because I couldn't understand them, wondered what you were doing.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:39.320]   "Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.720]   But as I close, let me put it to you like this.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.800]   Everything I've been trying to say tonight is seen most perfectly, it seems to me,
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.400]   in the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.760]   There it is.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.480]   I say it with reverence, the strangest thing that God has ever done.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:11.560]   God sent his Son into the world and allowed that to happen.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.040]   How do you understand it?
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.720]   I say there's only one way to understand it, and that is to know that God is holy.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:28.120]   God's holiness dictates that sin must be punished.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.880]   And God cannot forgive any sinner until the sin has been punished.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:41.080]   God can't go back on his own word and on his own law, the expression of his own being.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:48.120]   And God has said that sin must be punished, and that he who sins must die; the wages of sin is death.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:57.400]   It seems strange when you look at it at first, but the more you look at that cross,
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.840]   the more you see the perfection of God's ways, and how
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:08.120]   his thoughts and his ways are beyond searching and beyond understanding.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.960]   That's God's wisdom.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.440]   It seems to be going wrong.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.320]   The world seems to be triumphing, and his Son is suffering.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.600]   He's God-defeated.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.760]   He dies, and he's buried in a grave.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:26.840]   Yes, but he rises again to triumph and victory and glory.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:35.800]   My dear friends, don't try to understand the inscrutable, but see there the holiness of God.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.720]   See there the unchangeable holiness of God.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.960]   See there that God knows what he's doing.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:48.120]   See there this amazing wisdom of God that has contrived a way that you and I be saved.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.320]   That God can be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.120]   That's the question.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:01.640]   It isn't merely a problem of forgiveness, but God must forgive in such a way that he still remains just.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.480]   And that's the meaning of the cross.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.920]   God is there just.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:09.560]   He's punishing sin, and yet he's the justifier of the ungodly.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.920]   The one who believes in Jesus.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.320]   Why?
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.240]   Well, he's punished the sin in Jesus, and therefore he can forgive the sinner.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.160]   His righteousness is vindicated.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:23.000]   His holiness remains unsullied, and yet men can be forgiven.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.320]   The apparent defeat is the greatest victory.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:32.520]   You see the holiness of God, the unchanging character of God.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:38.440]   And you see God's eternal and everlasting wisdom.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.800]   Very well then, my friend, it comes to this.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:48.040]   What's our reaction now to this gospel of God?
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.520]   It's quite plain.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.800]   This is what he tells us.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.200]   That we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.840]   That we all merit punishment and death and hell.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.800]   Every one of us.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.200]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.760]   God has proclaimed that.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.120]   And when God says a thing, it's true, and it'll never be changed.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.720]   That is the truth about us all.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:18.840]   But God in his love has provided the way of salvation.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:25.000]   In his only begotten Son and through his death upon the cross.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:33.320]   And he offers to anyone who believes on him, free pardon and forgiveness this very minute.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:43.080]   Reconciliation, new life, and an everlasting and a blessed hope.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.040]   There are God's statements.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.600]   They'll never change, they'll never be varied.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.280]   They'll be put into practice, they'll be carried out.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.240]   But oh, you say, I see no evidence of that.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.080]   Two thousand years have gone since Christ was buried.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.640]   Where is the promise of his coming, my dear friend?
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.840]   It will come.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.000]   God seems to delay, but a thousand years in his sight are but as one day.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.920]   And one day as a thousand years.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.840]   What God has said, God will perform.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.240]   And it's one or the other, blessing or cursing.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.120]   And there is no middle way.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.200]   What have you made of it?
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:31.240]   Have you submitted to him and surrendered to him?
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:38.280]   Sinners, Jesus came to save.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:42.200]   Do you remember our Lord's parable of the workers in the vineyard?
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.000]   He, where the employer went out early in the day, he saw some men standing idle.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.200]   He said, go and work in my vineyard and I'll give you a penny for it.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:50.920]   Off they went.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.280]   Hours later, he went out again and saw another group.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.680]   Sent them in the same way and on the same terms.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.760]   He went out at the eleventh hour and there were still some men standing idle.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.600]   And he said, why don't you go and work?
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.960]   Go in and I'll give you a penny.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.320]   And they went in and worked.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.440]   Then the time came and the master went to pay them.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:14.920]   And he called first of all those who had gone into the vineyard at the eleventh hour.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.520]   And he gave them a penny.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:21.960]   And then they came all in turn.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.640]   And then came finally the people who'd gone in at the very beginning.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.600]   And he gave them a penny also.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.680]   And they looked at him and they said, look here, what's this?
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.240]   You gave a penny to the people who only worked for an hour.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.560]   And are you only giving a penny to us who have borne the heat and the burden of the day?
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.240]   This is scandalous, they said.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.920]   Look here, we must have more.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.160]   Five or six times what you've given them.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.360]   Even ten times.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:52.920]   And our Lord had to tell them the same thing.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.880]   Is thine eye evil because I am good, he says?
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:03.480]   Have I done you any wrong by being gracious to these lost?
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.120]   Can't I do as I like with my own?
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.600]   That's grace.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.160]   Did you know this, my friend?
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.800]   That if God were not a God of grace, every one of us would be damned.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.160]   There'd be no hope for any.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.840]   For we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.440]   We've no right to ask anything.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.200]   You've insulted God.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.160]   You've ignored him.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.920]   You've put your will before him.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.520]   You've turned your back upon him.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.000]   He's told you in your conscience not to do something.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.440]   You've done it deliberately.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.880]   That's how you've treated him.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.040]   And you haven't thanked him for your blessings.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.120]   And yet you think you've got a claim upon him.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:44.280]   It is of God's mercy only that we are not all consumed.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:50.360]   God can do as he likes with his own, and he will.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:56.040]   His son worked miracles in Capernaum, not in Nazareth.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.840]   Do you know why he didn't work miracles in Nazareth?
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.880]   I'll tell you.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.320]   He knew the people.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.920]   He knew their attitude.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:07.400]   And he knew that unless that was broken down, there was no hope for them.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.960]   If he'd worked miracles, they'd have stood on, admiring and expressing their criticisms.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.080]   He knew the trouble.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.680]   He had to break them down.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:21.960]   And we all must be broken down.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:33.960]   There is only one key, if I may so put it, that opens the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:41.320]   It is the key of repentance, the key of the acknowledgement of sin,
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.880]   the key that makes a man say, "I have nothing.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.480]   Have mercy upon me."
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.400]   That he finds irresistible.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:54:01.640]   And he always responds and showers down of the riches of his grace.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:07.720]   Oh, may God open our eyes to the tragedy of rejecting him
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.600]   because we don't understand him and what he does,
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.080]   because he doesn't do what we think he ought to do,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:19.960]   and because he asks us to come to him as suppliants on bended knee,
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.120]   realizing our desperate need.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.680]   Amen.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
