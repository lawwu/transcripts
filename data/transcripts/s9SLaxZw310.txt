[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:16.400]   the Gospel according to St. John in the second chapter, verses 23, 24, and 25. The last three
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.680]   verses in the second chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.320]   Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.680]   when they saw the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:49.680]   he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of men, for he knew what was in men.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.280]   Let me read those words again. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the feast
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.680]   day, many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.640]   commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.680]   of men, for he knew what was in men. In other words, we go on with the consideration of
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.760]   what we are told in this second half of this second chapter of John's Gospel of what happened
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.600]   when our Lord went up to Jerusalem at the time of the Jews' Passover. We've already
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.160]   been considering how he there drove out those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.120]   changers of money and upset all their tables and so on. And what he said to them as he
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:56.400]   did so. We have also considered the reaction of the Jews, the Jewish leaders in particular,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.160]   to that. How they turned to him saying, "What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.840]   doest these things?" And how our Lord answered them in that indirect manner, telling them
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.160]   in effect that the only sign he would give them would be the sign of his coming resurrection
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.360]   from the dead. Well now, here we have a comment from John
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.640]   the writer, the evangelist, as to something further which happened during that same visit
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.600]   of our Lord to Jerusalem. And it's obvious, I think you'll all agree, especially those
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.800]   who were here last Sunday, that here the same theme, the same subject is being considered
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.280]   and continued as we were examining together then. It is a further statement and exposition
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:02.720]   of this whole question of silence. Now, we obviously are confronted by something once
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.480]   more that is of very vital concern to us. We are examining the whole Gospel, as I'm
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.880]   indicating from Sunday to Sunday, in order that we may see how it is we may obtain of
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.600]   his fullness and grace upon grace. That's the whole object of the Christian salvation.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.080]   That's why he came. He came in order that we might have life, that we might have it
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.640]   more abundantly. Which put in other words, as it is in the 16th verse of the first chapter
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.200]   of this Gospel, of his fullness of all we receive and grace upon grace. That's the
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   great question. That should be the great concern of every Christian, to make sure that he or
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.240]   she has received and is receiving in ever increasing measure of that blessed fullness.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.160]   So now, there are obviously many difficulties with regard to that. There are problems. Otherwise
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.080]   we all would be rejoicing in this fullness, in all its abundance. Why are we not doing
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.880]   so? Well, it's obvious that there are certain pitfalls, certain dangers. We must never forget
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.240]   the fact that we are confronted by an adversary, an opponent, one who is not only our adversary
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   but still more the adversary of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ. And his greatest concern
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.680]   is that we should not receive of this fullness. His objective being, of course, that the Christian
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.400]   salvation shall be brought into disrepute and that the new creation should be marred
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:53.160]   and spoiled even as the first and the original creation was. So that clearly there are many
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.560]   things that we need to know and to learn. And thank God we are not left without instruction.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   And here we are again given further light and instruction on this whole question of
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.520]   silence. Clearly, at the very beginning of our Lord's ministry, this arose as a difficulty
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.240]   and he had to deal with it. And we are told here of how he has done so.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.320]   Now let's examine this position. It's quite clear, I think, on the surface, that these
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.720]   people we are now looking at differ from the people we were looking at together last Sunday.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.600]   There we were confronted by these Jewish leaders who were incapable of seeing the signs that
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.560]   he had already given. They didn't understand, for instance, what he was doing when he cleansed
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.160]   the temple. They missed the point completely. And it was because they failed to see that
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.200]   and failed to appreciate its significance that they had asked him to do something really
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   spectacular. Give us a sign, they said, that's unmistakable. Give us something that will
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   be so phenomenal that, well, we shall be satisfied and we'll come to believe on you. That's
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.400]   really what they were asking for. They were unable to see the meaning and the point of
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.160]   the signs and said they could only believe on him if they had something much bigger and
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.800]   something more spectacular. But now, here you see, we are dealing with
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.200]   people who are obviously in a very different category. Here are people of whom we are told
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:49.760]   that they believed in his name when they saw the miracles or the signs which he did. So
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.320]   that clearly I say they're in a different position. These have seen the signs and on
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.920]   the strength of them. They believe in his name and they want to follow him. They want
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.840]   to join him. They want to be his disciples. Well, here it is. We are dealing with a category
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.280]   which is different from the previous one and yet is still concerned about this whole matter
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.720]   of the signs. Now then, here is a problem confronting us.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.440]   And it's a very real problem. And we must be aware of its nature and its character.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:35.400]   Because what we find here is equally true today. And I think is as urgent a problem
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:43.800]   at this moment as it was when this actual incident took place. Now the problem is this.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.560]   That here we are looking at people who apparently are doing the right thing. And yet our Lord
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.080]   does not accept them. The difficulty with the others was that they couldn't appreciate
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.280]   the signs and therefore didn't believe in him. Here are people who believe in his name
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.360]   because they have seen the signs. They seem to be the exact opposite of the previous ones
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.320]   and therefore we tend to think at first that they must of necessity be right. That these
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.360]   surely are the very type of person that our Lord was anxious to have as his followers.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.720]   People who could see the signs and understand them and accept them and thereby express a
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:32.480]   desire to become his followers. But he did not commit himself unto them. He did not accept
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   them. And there is the problem and the perplexity that faces us.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:45.880]   Well now, it's not unique of course. You've got the same thing rarely. In the sixth chapter
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:52.400]   of this same gospel in verse 14 where we are told, "Then those men, when they had seen
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.160]   the miracle that Jesus did set, this is of a truth, that prophet that should come into
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   the world." But then you go on and read, "When Jesus therefore perceived that they
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.320]   would come and take him by force to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:17.560]   himself alone." Same kind of person, same kind of phenomenon. And of course there is
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.960]   a statement of our Lord at the end of the sermon on the mount that seems to me to put
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.400]   the same thing again very plainly and very clearly.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   In the seventh chapter of the gospel according to St. Matthew, reading from verse 21, "Not
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:40.080]   every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. But
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:47.240]   he that doeth the will of my Father which is in him, many will say to me in that day,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:53.480]   Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.200]   and in thy name done many wonderful works? Then will I profess unto them, I never knew
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:10.400]   you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity." There is exactly the same thing put in that
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.440]   very definite form. Here are people then I say that seem to be
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:22.520]   glorying in his silence and who call him Lord, Lord, and want to be his disciples and followers
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:29.200]   because of what they've seen. And yet he repudiates them and says that he doesn't
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.440]   love them, he doesn't commit himself to them. Well now, here is the essence of the
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:43.040]   problem. That on the surface, his behavior towards these people, his reaction to them,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.640]   seems to be a contradiction of what is plainly and clearly his teaching elsewhere. What am
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:56.200]   I referring to? Well, I am referring to the teaching which is given in many places in
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.960]   which our Lord seems to be arguing that they should have believed in him because of the
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.160]   signs. Now let me give you some illustrations. Take for instance, in the tenth chapter of
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:15.760]   this same gospel in verse 38. Our Lord is dealing with these people. He's been saying,
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:24.840]   if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though you believe not
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:33.440]   me, believe the works, that he may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   him. Then you've got in the twelfth chapter of this same gospel in verse 37 this statement.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.400]   But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him. Now that's
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.520]   obviously a condemnation. They should have believed. Though he had done so many signs,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:04.360]   miracles before them, yet they believed not on him. And eventually there is another, we've
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:14.520]   got another one in chapter 14 and in verse 7, where our Lord says again that they should
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:22.440]   have believed in him because of these works. You've got it in several statements here.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.040]   Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:36.000]   works sake. John 14 11. A perfectly plain statement. And finally in chapter 15 in verse
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.680]   24. If I had not done among them the works which none other men did, they had not had
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:50.640]   the sin. But now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. Now the whole purport
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.360]   of all those statements is that they are rendered inexcusable for their unbelief because of
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.120]   the signs which he has worked. As if the argument were, well there are the signs, surely you
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.920]   must accept them and believe. It is through them that you believe. And yet here we are
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:14.000]   dealing with people who claim to believe in him because of the signs. Many believed in
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.680]   his name when they saw the miracles which he did. Now here's our problem. How do we
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:29.840]   reconcile these things? Well it seems to me that this is the line on which we do so. It
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:39.920]   is clear that the signs should lead us to believe in him. That is why those who don't
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:48.480]   see them and appreciate their significance are condemned for not believing in him. But
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:56.360]   it is made equally plain and clear that belief in him and being impressed by the signs alone
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:04.800]   is not enough. And there it seems to me you have the balance in this matter. The signs
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:12.880]   should lead us to believe in him. But if we believe in him only because of the signs,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.400]   we are in this defective position. Now one of the early fathers of the Church, it seems
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:25.280]   to me, has put this very well. When he said, "True faith is founded on God's Word,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:36.480]   not on wonders." True faith is founded on God's Word, not on wonders. Now but we've
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   got to work this out together. There I put it in the form of a general principle. These
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.160]   Jews we were dealing with last Sunday are under condemnation for not realizing who he
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.400]   is because of what he's just done in the temple. And yet these others who come rushing
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.640]   to him and want to be his disciples and followers and want to be accepted are rejected because
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.600]   they believe in him only because of the signs. Now then what are the principles of teaching
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:12.080]   here? Well let's put it as a question. What was wrong with these people? First of all
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.840]   I would direct your attention to the fact that we are told that many believed in his
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:24.360]   name when they saw the miracles which he did. Many. But he did not commit himself to them.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:31.800]   There is surely a preliminary lesson for us here at the present time. This is surely the
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.400]   thing that people are out for. Many believing, great results. Many believed. Surely this
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.720]   is the very thing that we would have expected our Lord to be delighted with, that he has
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:49.600]   come to gain followers and here many believe in his name. But he doesn't receive them.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.280]   There's a vital lesson for us there in passing. I'm not going to stop with it. Surely we
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.920]   ought to consider again this whole question of pressing people to a decision in the light
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.720]   of this teaching. Here are people who are pressing upon him and he pushes them back.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:16.840]   He rejects them. We surely must be careful in this whole matter of pressing and still
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:25.600]   more should we be careful when we are animated by a desire for large numbers and great results.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.880]   You go through these Gospels carefully and you will find that our Lord always in this
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:41.680]   way sifted. Well there is just a general warning. What was the matter I ask with these men who
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.480]   believed in his name because of the signs which they had seen? Well I think this phrase
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:55.240]   believed in his name gives us the answer to the question. I want to show you the difference
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:05.800]   between believing in his name and if you like, believing on his name. Believing in the name
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:15.520]   of the Lord Jesus, believing on the Lord Jesus Christ unto salvation. Now there is the great
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.280]   broad distinction. And these people we are looking at together here are a perfect illustration
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:30.720]   to us of those who do not believe truly. They think they do but they don't. They believe
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.760]   in his name. They have never believed on him and that is why he does not commit himself
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:44.360]   unto them. Now these people have in the past at times been called temporary believers.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.400]   Another name that has been given to them has been the name of false professors. That was
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.200]   the favorite name, designation implied by the Puritans in particular for this kind of
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:04.760]   person. Temporary believers, false professors, false professors of the Christian faith. And
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:12.080]   of course there is a good deal about this kind of person in the New Testament itself.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:18.840]   These are the same people it seems to me as the five foolish virgins in our Lord's parable
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.820]   of the ten virgins. The ten appear to be the same but they are not. They can be divided
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.680]   into two groups, five foolish, five wise. Though the general appearance is the same,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.360]   though they are all in a sense disciples, they are not in the same position. There is
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:45.080]   a final fundamental difference and it is so vital that it becomes an eternal difference.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:52.960]   The door is shut in the face of the foolish virgins at the critical moment. This is a
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:01.720]   most solemn and a most serious matter. It is exactly the same thing surely also as the
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.600]   case of the people we read about at the beginning of the sixth chapter of the epistle to the
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:14.400]   Hebrews. You know people who have made a profession and people who have had certain great experiences,
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.200]   they have tasted of the heavenly gifts and the power of the world to come and yet it
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.080]   is perfectly clear that they were never regenerate, they were never truly Christian at all. They
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.880]   I say belong to the same category as the people we are considering here at the end of this
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:36.520]   second chapter of John's Gospel. And surely they are exactly the same as the people who
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:44.560]   are described by this same writer John in his first epistle and in the second chapter
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.320]   where he describes them in these terms. He is dealing with the question of the Antichrists
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.880]   in verse 18. "Little children, it is the last time and as ye have heard that Antichrist
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.600]   shall come, even now are there many Antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time."
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:08.560]   Then on he goes, "They went out from us because they were not of us, for if they had
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.960]   been of us they would no doubt have continued with us. But they went out that they might
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:21.760]   be made manifest that they were not all of us." They you see had belonged to the church.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.400]   They had appeared to be all the true body of disciples. They were people who said yes
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.520]   we believe and they had asked to be received into the church and they had been received
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.040]   into the church. But after a while they had gone out. And they have gone out, says John,
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.480]   because they really were not of us. If they had been of us they would have continued with
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.920]   us. They appeared to be, they were temporary believers. They had got a false belief which
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.120]   at first gave the impression of being a true belief. Even the apostles, the leaders of
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.360]   the church couldn't recognize them for what they were. But here we are told that our Lord
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:09.160]   knows exactly, he recognizes them at once. He did not commit himself unto them. For he
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:17.120]   knew all men and need it not that any should testify of men for he knew what was in men.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:24.200]   Now then, what is the trouble with these people? How do we recognize them? What are the characteristics,
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:30.560]   characteristics of these temporary believers? This wrong belief, this thing that appears
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.800]   so right on the surface but which our Lord will not accept. He doesn't countenance it.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.200]   He doesn't commit himself to it. Well now, it's quite clear, isn't it, that they were
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.840]   attracted, they were interested, to use the modern term, they were intrigued by him. And
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.040]   they were anxious to be his followers. They seem to be true converts. They are rushing
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:58.520]   forward. They want to be accepted into the community. Why are they attracted? What is
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:07.240]   it? Well, it's obvious that they were attracted by the Lord himself, by his person. I'm showing
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.560]   you the characteristics of these people. They persist. They're as true today as they were
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:19.600]   at that time. Here are people who are interested in his person. Why? Well, because he's unique.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.280]   He is a kind of spectacle. He's a kind of phenomenon. Just consider the position. Here
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.840]   were people who were accustomed to the Pharisees and their teaching, and the scribes, and the
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.720]   Sadducees, and doctors of the law, and so on. And they knew that the men in any one
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:41.600]   of those positions was the men who had had to undergo a lot of training and of preparation.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.400]   And they used to listen to them comparing and contrasting what the authorities said
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   about all these detailed questions. And they appeared to be men of vast erudition and learning.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:58.240]   And they spoke on the basis of this knowledge. But here suddenly appears this extraordinary
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:06.040]   person, a carpenter, and of all places from a place called Galilee. "Shall any good come
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:12.480]   out of Galilee?" That was the proverbial saying. And here he comes, and without any
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:19.280]   of this training or preparation, he suddenly appears before them. Something absolutely
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.680]   new. Now there are people who are always attracted by the novel. They get tired. They're like
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.600]   those Athenians. You remember we are told about the Athenians when Paul went there.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:36.640]   They were forever, they lived either to tell or to hear some new thing. We are familiar
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.760]   with that kind of attitude. Well, here is a new phenomenon. Here is a new teacher, and
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.360]   especially one who teaches with authority. He's not just comparing and contrasting and
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.880]   quoting authorities. He stands up and says, "I say unto you." And there are people who,
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.320]   when they hear a word or a note of authority like that, are always ready to listen and
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:03.960]   to believe. There's a craving for authority. It no doubt accounts for a great deal of the
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.800]   return of people to the Church of Rome. This craving for authority, many who've done it
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.480]   have said in their autobiographies that that's the thing that really made them do it. And
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.760]   any other kind of movement that appears to speak with an authority will always attract
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   certain types of persons. Our Lord did that. And undoubtedly it was a part and inert of
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.520]   the thing that caused him to be so attractive to these people. But then they liked his teaching
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:39.280]   as well. Here was a critic of Judaism. And there are people who always like that. He
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.480]   was a critic of the old religious tradition. He just proved it by turning these people
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.200]   out of the temple. There was the old religion and all its paraphernalia. And he gets up
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:58.320]   and he's revolutionary. And he dislikes it and he turns it out. Now that in and of itself
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.440]   makes a very great appeal to this kind of person. They're always interested in something
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.800]   like this. They like to feel that they've made a discovery of something that for all
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:16.240]   the past centuries the Church has been completely ignorant of. That in itself appeals to them.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:23.160]   And so they're attracted by anything that has this novel note in its teaching. Seems
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.760]   to come from an entirely different angle and proposes something that had never been known
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:36.440]   before. But then still more of course is the fact of the miracles, the signs themselves.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:43.720]   Now here is something again which you will find dealt with in many places in the New
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:50.600]   Testament. I read one typical perfect example of it just now when we read that story of
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:58.800]   Simon the Sorcerer, Simon Magus amongst the Samaritans. A typical example and illustration
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:06.640]   of this. This interest in the phenomenal—I was dealing with it partly last Sunday morning,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.600]   but let me put it on a different level—this is the kind of thing that you often get during
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:20.080]   a period of revival and of religious awakening. There has never yet been a revival, but that
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   with the revival, tied as it were, many people have been washed up as it were onto the shore
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.200]   who really don't belong to Christianity and to the Church and have never become true
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:38.000]   believers. But they appear for the time being to be true believers. The tide of the movement
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.040]   of the Spirit seems to take them up and to carry them along. And they say everything
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:51.120]   that's right and they seem to be truly Christian. Subsequent history proves that they've never
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:57.560]   really been Christian at all, but that they belong to this category of person with whom
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.800]   we are dealing. You always get this same kind of thing in any period of what may be called
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:11.520]   religious excitement. If you get a great organized mass campaign and people see others going
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.160]   forward, instinctively they get up and go forward also. No, I'm not suggesting that
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.240]   they're dishonest. They're not. That's not the difficulty. They're deceiving themselves.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:27.840]   They're not aware, but they're just moved by the religious excitement. When something's
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.480]   happening, something unusual, they're always ready to make this kind of response whenever
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.560]   anything is happening. What's the cause of this? Well, this is what you may call,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:45.800]   if you like, credulity. Credulity. And this is the vital distinction that surely comes
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:52.880]   out in this whole episode. It is the difference between credulity and true faith. What is
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:28:00.360]   credulity? Well, credulity is the kind of thing I have been describing to you. It is
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:09.160]   this mentality, this condition, which is ready in a sense to believe anything whatsoever.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:16.480]   It's open to anything new or novel or interesting or exciting. And it always becomes a victim
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:22.400]   to it. As we say, it falls for it. And you will find that it will do this many, many
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:29.280]   times. That it will take up teachings which are really almost mutually exclusive and entirely
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.560]   contradictory. Doesn't matter. It's the last thing they've heard, and it impresses
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:39.720]   them. There is this kind of mentality. We are all up to a point subject to it. Not all.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.520]   There are some, of course, who are so afraid of credulity that they're not open to anything.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:51.280]   They're hardened against everything. And they quench the spirit. And they remain in
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:59.480]   their self-invented security and have never known any touch of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:07.040]   That's not the true antithesis of credulity. The true antithesis is a true and a living
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   and a real and a sound faith. But here it is, there is such a thing as credulity. And
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.240]   we must all examine ourselves to make very sure of these matters. But then, often accompanying
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.720]   this spirit of credulity, which is general, and something which in a sense we are born
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.500]   with. But remember, we've got to realize what we are born with. We've all got something
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:38.040]   peculiar to fight. We must get to know ourselves and our particular dangers, and we must always
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.240]   be unusually careful with regard to them. However, in addition to the credulity, there
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.720]   is something further. And that is, of course, this wrong motive that tends to creep in.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.760]   And especially when phenomena are apparent. Now that's the great message, of course,
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:59.680]   of this whole case of Simon Magus. You notice how everything we are told about that man
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.880]   really points in that same direction. Let me single out these verses in particular with
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.800]   respect to him in that eighth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, verse 13.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.760]   Then Simon himself believed also. And when he was baptized, he continued with Philip
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:22.120]   and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. You see, already you're
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   given an insight. This is the thing that was captivating him. We are not told that he was
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.840]   increasingly amazed at the teaching, at the doctrine that Philip was propounding. Ah,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.720]   these miracles and signs, this was the thing that was getting him. Then in verse 18, when
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:43.340]   Simon saw that through the laying on of the Apostle's hand the Holy Ghost was given,
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.400]   he offered them money saying, give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:59.440]   he may receive the Holy Ghost. The desire to be important, the desire to be prominent,
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:07.400]   the desire to be a possessor of gifts that enables you to do things. Now, again, this
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:12.740]   appeals to the natural men, especially in certain types. We're all guilty of this.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:19.800]   We all like to be prominent. We all like notoriety. We all like praise. We all like to be important.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.000]   It's innate in men as the result of sin and the fall. Now that can creep even into the
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.520]   spiritual realm. And we see things happening, we say, now if only I could do that, how wonderful
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:36.760]   it would be. Oh, let us all examine ourselves, my dear friends. The desire to be a great
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:44.360]   preacher, the desire to be a great anything. The devil is always there. You remember the
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.600]   famous story of John Bunyan had just preached and was going out and somebody came and praised
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.240]   him and said, what a wonderful sermon. But John Bunyan understood these matters. He said,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:01.080]   it's all right, the devil has already told me that. Yes, well, if you were a preacher
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:07.280]   you wouldn't laugh at that, you'd weep. You see, that was the spirit in Simon Magus.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:14.000]   Here it is, the desire, let me, I'd like to be doing this. I'd like to have this,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.720]   so that I can talk about it and people will be talking about me, that I'm now doing
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.560]   this, that, and the other. Here it is, this terrible spirit. Or indeed, and of course
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.100]   the element of merchandise came in, and James has got a very striking and salutary thing
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:36.580]   to tell us about this. Listen to James in the fourth chapter of his epistle. Second
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:42.180]   and third verses he says, "You lust and have not, you kill and desire to have and
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:50.560]   cannot obtain, you fight and war and you yet have not because you ask not. You ask and
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:33:00.280]   receive not, why? Because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts." Now,
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:07.700]   lust doesn't there mean fleshly sex, he's not referring to that. Lust of what? Lust
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:14.760]   of power, lust of notoriety, lust of prominence, lust of greatness, lust of authority. That's
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.340]   the lust he's talking about. He says, you ask but you don't receive because you don't
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:28.980]   ask properly, you ask amiss that you may consume it on your own lusts. Now my dear friends,
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:36.700]   these are terrible things, but our Lord knows everything. And he knows when people profess
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.820]   to believe in him when they see the signs, he knows when it is something base like this,
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:49.900]   unworthy and mercenary, or which panders only to the flesh that is really animating them.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:55.560]   And of course, there is no doubt at all that this was the position of a large number of
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:01.520]   people in the church at Corinth. That is why Paul ever had to write the twelfth and thirteenth
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.920]   and fourteenth chapters of his first epistle to the Corinthians. They were boasting and
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.160]   vying with one another concerning the gifts. They were giving prominence to tongues in
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.520]   a way that they shouldn't. He has to rebuke them about this. They've lost their balance.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.120]   They are boasting and they're despising one another and envying one another. Now when
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.960]   you get to that, it's wrong. You're interested in gifts in an entirely wrong sense. It's
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.840]   to consume them on your own lusts in some way. Remember, there were people in the church
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.640]   at Corinth, let's be fair, who were doing exactly the same thing with their great intellectual
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.960]   understanding. That's the people dealt with in the eighth chapter. And Paul has to say
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:51.680]   to them, "Knowledge puffeth up. Charity builds up." You see, it can happen in any
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.720]   realm. It isn't only about the more spectacular gifts. It's about understanding of theology
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.480]   and doctrine, knowledge of the Bible. Oh, you can boast of it. You can be proud of yourself.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.560]   And your real reason for studying and reading is that you may show you a great knowledge.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:13.640]   It's exactly the same thing. Very wrong, then. Here, it seems to me, are these general
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:23.200]   characteristics of these people. Now, my friends, mankind doesn't change. And there are people
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.080]   like this today. There are people who think they're truly Christian, but all they've
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.920]   got is a general interest in Jesus, as they generally call him. Jesus. Not the Lord Jesus
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.880]   Christ, but Jesus. They're interested in Jesus and in his teaching. They write books
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.320]   about him. They speak about him. They talk to one another about him. This is their great
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:52.880]   interest. Interest in Jesus, this man. And interest in the Bible. I've known people
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.840]   who've had nothing but, to me, a purely mechanical interest in the Bible. And they're clever
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.640]   at turning up here and there and comparing. They've got it all classified. They can give
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.680]   it to you all in a second, a whole book of the Scripture. My dear friends, that's not
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:13.480]   knowledge of the Scripture. And there are people still who are interested in phenomena.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:19.680]   Now then, what's the real trouble with these people? Well, here it is, isn't it? As Theophilus
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:28.200]   put it, their position is not based on the Word. It's not based on the teaching. It's
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:35.280]   based on wonders, based on phenomena. That's the fundamental trouble. And because of that,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.400]   of course, it is superficial. Or let me put it like this to you. The real trouble with
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.640]   such people, whichever department they belong to, is that their belief in his name is always
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:52.160]   a partial one. It's a partial one. It's not a whole one. It's not a complete one.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.920]   Now there are some people who believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with their heads
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:05.720]   only, only their heads. They've got a theoretical knowledge. They've got an intellectual belief.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:12.000]   They've got a philosophical approach to him. But their hearts have never been touched.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.800]   They've never been moved. They've never been melted. And their wills have not been
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.720]   touched. All this great knowledge they've got, it's never changed their lives. It
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.160]   doesn't govern their conduct and behavior. They live like worldly people, which is what
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.560]   they are. Worldly people can take an intellectual interest in the teaching of the Christian
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.360]   faith. I've often said that it's such a glorious system, even looked at as a system
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.280]   of truth, that any intelligent men ought to be attracted by it. And many such men have
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.880]   been attracted by it, but it's only been in their heads. It's never gone any further.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:57.600]   That's one kind of this defective, false profession.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.960]   Then you see there are others in whose case it's only the heart that is touched. They
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.560]   have sometimes even been encouraged to this. They've heard preachers saying, "Let yourselves
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.920]   go. Stop thinking. Let yourself go." And they've let themselves go. Their minds have
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.680]   not been in operation at all. They've deliberately abandoned them. They've allowed their feelings
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:24.040]   to be disturbed, a riot of the feelings and of the imagination. There's no understanding.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.000]   In fact, they may have been told, "It doesn't matter whether you understand or not. The
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.440]   great thing is that you're getting this experience." See, it's only a heart and
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:41.400]   the realm of the sensibilities. The understanding is not involved, and alas, so often with such
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.960]   people the will is never engaged.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   But then there's a third group in which it's almost entirely a matter of the will.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.320]   They don't trouble to understand. They're not bothered about that, and they're not
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.600]   interested in their feelings. They have been told by a certain teaching, "If thou shalt
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.680]   confess with thy mouth, you've got to do something." And they're ready always to
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.920]   do things. They're not interested in the intellectual comprehension. And they say the
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.360]   heart can be very deceitful. But what I like is a message which tells me, "Now all you've
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:20.240]   got to do is to do this. Start doing something, and they'll do it." And that's all they've
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.960]   got. It's purely and entirely in the realm of the will and of activity.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:33.680]   That's what's wrong with that sort of belief, my friends. It's a partial belief. One of
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.320]   the fundamental points about this message, this gospel, is this, that it takes up the
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:45.040]   entire man. Romans 6, 17 once more. "We thank God that he were once the servants of
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:52.920]   sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine delivered unto you." The
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:40:00.000]   entire man. And if your whole man is not engaged, you can be certain you're a false professor.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.360]   Well, but let me put this a little more in detail. The trouble, I say, ultimately with
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:11.880]   these people is this, that they've only believed in his name. They've never believed on him.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.040]   They've never truly committed themselves to him. It's pointed out, and rightly, that the
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:23.320]   same word is in the original for "believed" and "committed." Many believed in his name
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.240]   when they saw the miracles which he did, but Jesus did not believe in them, if you like,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.840]   did not commit himself unto them. Same word. Well, in other words, these people have never
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:39.920]   committed themselves unto him. It has only been the superficial kind of belief that I've
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:46.800]   been illustrating. What is the trouble? Well, I can put it like this. These people have
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:53.560]   completely misunderstood him. Completely. And you'll find many examples of that as
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.680]   you go through the gospels. They think they have, but they haven't. You're a people interested
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:04.400]   in him as a miracle worker. You remember the people we read about in John 6, I read you
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:10.080]   a quotation. They tried to take him by force to make him a king. They were interested in
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:17.320]   him as king. Others were interested in him as a political agitator. Others, as I say,
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.920]   are interested in him as a healer. No, you've still got all these types. They're still about,
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.960]   they regard themselves as Christians, but they're only interested in him in this partial
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.920]   manner. They pick out what appeals to them. And because of that, and he's done the thing
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:36.240]   they wanted, they believe in him. And you can easily think out these various categories
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.760]   for yourself. They've never really seen him as he is. But they're interested in different
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:50.520]   aspects of his activity. And they select that and only that, and so their belief is partial
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.880]   as regards themselves, and it's partial as regards him. Perhaps the best way of showing
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.920]   you this is to show you the great contrast between these people and people like Andrew
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.320]   and Philip, of whom we've read in the first chapter. Listen. You see, this is the true
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:12.400]   reaction. Andrew, you remember, had been with him, and then we are told he first finded
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:18.320]   his own brother Simon, and said unto him, what did he say to him? We have found a miracle
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   worker. We have found one who does signs. We've found one who's going to be the king.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:30.360]   He says, we have found the messiahs, which is being interpreted the Christ. You see the
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:36.600]   depth? He's really got an insight into who our Lord is and why he's come. You've got
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.620]   exactly the same thing here in the case of Philip, verse 45. Philip findeth Nathanael
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:48.400]   and saith unto him, we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write,
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.440]   Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. You see the contrast? He's interested in the person,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   in the totality of the person. He has a glimpse into the ultimate. He's not concerned about
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:06.800]   partial things or exciting immediate things. And of course, you've got the same thing with
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:15.920]   Nathanael himself. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the son of
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:22.400]   God, thou art the king of Israel. Now, what made him say that? Well, it was because our
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.320]   Lord had said to him, where Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.800]   thee when thou wast under the fig tree I saw thee. Nathanael didn't turn to him and say,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.720]   well you're wonderful, you know, you seem to be able to see even through the leaves
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.240]   and everything. You've got some extraordinary psychic power. I'm tremendously interested
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:49.120]   and intrigued by this kind of phenomenon. Not at all. Rabbi, thou art the son of God.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:54.880]   Not miracle worker, not this partial understanding of him. Now, these people you see at Jerusalem
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   have never seen this. They've never seen him in the glory of his person. They have
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.400]   no understanding at all of him as savior. They didn't realize why he'd come into the
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:09.040]   world. They thought he'd come into the world to do these phenomena. But he hadn't. The
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.160]   phenomena are to lead to him. And if you stop with the phenomena, he won't commit himself
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.320]   to you. They're all designed to lead to him and to an understanding of his person. That's
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.720]   what happens always with the true disciples. We've got the contrast here and in the earlier
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:31.800]   part of this chapter in the same way. But these people now, they are completely misunderstood.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.920]   They think they're going after him for the right reason. They're praising him and they
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.040]   want to be his disciples. He doesn't commit himself to them. Well, let me put this in
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.920]   another form, in the negative form, before I close. You know the real trouble with these
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:52.840]   people is this. They've never seen themselves properly. They've never seen themselves as
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:59.520]   helpless, hopeless sinners. Oh, they fell to need of a bit of help and a bit of advice
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:05.720]   and a bit of teaching and some example, and they go to Jesus for this extra bit of teaching,
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.120]   this extra advice and help, and this wonderful example. But that's all they need. They're
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:16.240]   not completely helpless. How unlike Peter there. You remember Peter and the others had
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.080]   been out fishing one night and had caught nothing. Our Lord comes to them and he says,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.400]   "Go out again. Throw the net on the other side." And they caught so many that the net
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:29.760]   broke. An amazing miracle. What is the effect of that upon Peter? This. Peter came to him
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:38.240]   and said, "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man." He didn't say, "Let me follow
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.320]   the marvelous miracle worker that thou art." "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:50.280]   man." These people had never felt that. You see, these people, if I may so put it, are
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.960]   still in charge of themselves. And being in charge of themselves, they decide to join
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.080]   him. "Ah, this is what we want. Now this is the kind of teacher we are going to follow."
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:06.440]   And standing on their legs full of confidence, they decide to join him and to go after him.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:13.320]   They've never been humbled. Never been humbled. And this is one of the best signs of the true
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:20.240]   believer. He's always a man who's been humbled. These people are too healthy. They've never
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.600]   been convicted. They've never been cast to the ground. They've never cried out in any
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.240]   shape or form, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" They've never known that. But they
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.360]   decide for Christ. And they've been seen in meetings before now, talking to one another,
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.280]   saying, "Shall we go forward or shall we not?" And women have been known even putting their
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.920]   hair tidy before they decide to go forward. That's health, my friends. That's not brokenness.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:52.560]   That's not humility. That's not being convicted by the Holy Ghost. They're healthy and they're
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:59.600]   deciding to go after Jesus. That's not the true believer. The true believer is a man
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:10.200]   who's seen the blessed person and seen himself. "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:16.600]   man." The true believer is a man who's heard him say something like this, "If any men would
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:25.480]   be my disciple, let him deny himself." No self-interest, no self-trust or confidence.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:32.720]   Let him deny himself. "Take up the cross and follow me." Not a life of rapturous excitement
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.840]   and thrill. No, no, there's a cross-bearing element in it. And you deliberately take it
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:45.760]   up and follow him whether so ever he may lead you. You are not in charge. You don't decide
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:51.600]   what you want. You don't pick and choose. You don't eye things like a Simon Magus does.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:58.520]   No, no. These people have once and forever been summed up in this phrase, "This people
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:11.440]   honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." My dear friends, may God
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:21.200]   give us grace to examine ourselves. We claim to be his followers, don't we? Has he committed
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   himself to you? That's the question. How do you know that? God willing, we'll go on to
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.440]   consider that next Sunday morning. But I've already given you some tests. You can examine
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:37.000]   yourself. You can examine yourself in the light of these people and the similar persons
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.600]   that we had put before us in the different parts of the scripture. Let's realize this
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:50.480]   terrible possibility that he may look upon us and say, "I never knew you. Depart from
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:49:00.800]   me, ye that work iniquity." What's your interest in him? What's your view of him? What is your
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:11.960]   ultimate desire? Amen.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:21.080]   The closing hymn is hymn number 425. 425. My God, I love thee not because I hope for
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:43.240]   heaven thereby, nor yet because who loved thee not hath lost eternally. 425.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:57.640]   My God, I love thee not because I hope for heaven thereby, nor yet because who loved
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:23.320]   thee not hath lost eternally. 425.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:29.880]   May the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:37.400]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:46.000]   of this hour short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we shall see him
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.840]   as he is and ever be with him. Amen.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.960]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
