[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.920]   So, one of the things about our community
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.640]   is once you get it, once you're enlightened,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.720]   you have your aha moment, however you like to put it,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.780]   your epiphany about what this is all about.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700]   The way we grow this community is by helping each other.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.240]   It's a grassroots community.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.200]   So, we go out and we tell other people about it,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.500]   maybe family members, maybe friends.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.100]   However, wherever you see a need,
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.060]   you sort of step up and say,
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.960]   "Hey, I've got an idea for you here.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.000]   "Go to bogleheads.org, go to bogelcenter.net,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.880]   "get one of Jack Bogle's books."
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   And we become ambassadors for this philosophy
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.240]   of investing and saving and financial well-being
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.800]   that we have.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   And with that, we need to have an understanding
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.360]   when we do that of what works
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.880]   and maybe what doesn't work, right?
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.920]   We all have approached people and sometimes it works,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.120]   sometimes it doesn't work.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.560]   So, we thought that today we would have a little bit
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.840]   of insight into training the trainers.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.880]   So, you are, if you consider yourself teachers,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.960]   you are all, once you get enlightened
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.240]   to become bogelheads and call yourself bogelheads,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   you are actually crossed over
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.160]   to become ambassadors and teachers.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.160]   And so, how do we do that?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   So today, we have Tim Ranzetta with us,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.760]   who's a bogelhead, bonafide bogelhead.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.140]   He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1989
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.720]   with a bachelor degree in commerce
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.840]   and received his MBA in 1996
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.760]   from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.800]   He then became a consultant for Bain & Company
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.400]   and later became a successful entrepreneur.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640]   He co-founded several companies
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.800]   and decided to begin giving back.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.840]   So, he started teaching a class in 2014
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.440]   in Palo Alto, California,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   and eventually now has morphed into a program,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.200]   a nonprofit organization that teaches teachers
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   how to teach this.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.080]   And so, I'll let Tim talk about the program,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.000]   and, but here he is, Tim Ranzetta.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.960]   - See how this mic works.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.440]   I'm Italian, so I like to use my hands.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.560]   Mics don't work.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.800]   What an amazing community.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.520]   So, I fit in the category of long-time lurker
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.720]   on the bogelheads forum.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.680]   Long-time Vanguard investor, but first-time attendee.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680]   And I think I've been on the ground about 24 hours now
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.960]   coming in from California,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.560]   and I feel like I found my tribe.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.080]   Just what an amazing, amazing conversations at lunch.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.480]   Just an amazing group.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.680]   So, I wanna ask you a question before we get started,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.280]   'cause we're talking about financial education here.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.680]   I want you to move a little bit, too.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.920]   Stand up if you think personal finance should be taught
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.580]   in every high school in America.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.640]   Please stay standing.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.160]   Okay, you just made the headline.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.900]   Bogelheads stand for financial education.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.520]   So, I wanna introduce some folks here,
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.200]   some really special folks here
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.880]   who are delivering financial education
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.640]   in local high schools in Virginia and Maryland.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.840]   So, I'm gonna ask them to stand.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.360]   Don't get embarrassed now.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.200]   So, we have Angela, we have Starlene,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   Julius, Alice, Loretta, Nicole,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.280]   and Lori is somewhere, I believe.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.800]   Hey, these are the folks who are--
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.120]   Please stay standing, I gotta finish.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.640]   This is just an amazing community of educators
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.320]   that make a difference in their communities.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.800]   In their schools.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.240]   During the pandemic,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.360]   we did a lot of Zoom professional development.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.160]   And I gotta tell you, I smiled every time I saw them
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   on Zoom because the energy enthusiasm
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   that they bring to this.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.160]   There's a movement happening across the US, folks,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.280]   and it's happening in classrooms
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.800]   because of educators like yours.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.640]   So, thank you.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   But I also know there's other teachers in the room.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.520]   If you have ever taught anybody personal finance,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.840]   family member, maybe in the school community,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   maybe a non-profit.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.280]   I ran into somebody earlier from Kansas
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   who teaches med school students.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.520]   Stand up.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.720]   Educators.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.680]   Thank you.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.760]   So, I really shouldn't be teaching this.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.280]   You all should be.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   So, I talked about the teachers.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.360]   Next thing I wanna do is have you hear from the students.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.520]   So, there's a two and a half minute video
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.200]   that we're gonna cue up here
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.960]   to hear what is the impact of this course to them.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.720]   - With personal finance,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   you take everything that happens in the real world
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.200]   and you bring it into the classroom.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.600]   - It's important to learn about it
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.080]   while you're in high school,
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.560]   instead of graduating out of college and having no idea.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.640]   - You don't wanna leave college and then be in debt.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.920]   And sometimes that debt can follow you
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.560]   for the rest of your adult life.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.920]   - When my mom was in high school,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.560]   she didn't have a class like this.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.200]   - I couldn't just ask my parents questions
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   about like banking or finances
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   because my parents hadn't gone through any of that.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.120]   - Since my family didn't talk much about money,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.120]   I actually didn't know anything at all.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.640]   I didn't even know investing was a thing.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.000]   I didn't even know financial literacy
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.680]   was a thing at all either.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.640]   - This is really the only class that we're given
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.120]   that's this applicable to real life.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.440]   - I've learned how to calculate a mortgage.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.680]   I've learned what ways credit card companies
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.680]   try to trap you.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.960]   - These little skills right now
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.880]   that don't seem like they're so fundamental
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.520]   in the long run will really help you out
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.760]   and allow you to live your life
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.600]   the way that you wanna live it.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.160]   - I 100% think that all high school students
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.200]   should take this course.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.080]   I don't know how someone could be successful
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.840]   without knowing how to manage their money.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.680]   - If you want kids who know how to not be in debt,
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.160]   what a credit score is,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.480]   what kind of credit card options there are out there,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.240]   if you want them to be more knowledgeable,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.560]   safer with their money, as well as be better spenders,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.160]   then personal finance is a must.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.760]   (soft music)
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:24.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.960]   - So I travel a lot around the country
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.080]   when people find out what I do,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.400]   they usually say one or sometimes,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   always say one thing, sometimes two.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.360]   First thing they say, it's the class I wish I had.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.240]   The second question, the second thing they say is,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.760]   can you teach my kids?
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.160]   So that's kind of what is my passion now.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.120]   How do we ensure that every high school student,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.360]   so gets a personal finance course.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.520]   I just want you to blurt out a guess.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.080]   What percent of kids today
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.640]   do you think take a personal finance, are required?
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.560]   It's part of the graduation requirements.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.600]   What percent of kids in America currently are required
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.040]   to take a personal finance course?
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.440]   5%, 20, 60?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.360]   Zero, okay, so here's what we're gonna do.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.920]   I'm gonna give you a number.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.280]   You're gonna stand up if you think it's over this number.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   15%.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.160]   Stand up if you think more than 15%
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.000]   of high schoolers.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.760]   Okay, I'm not gonna tell you the answer till later.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   Thank you.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.680]   Most of you think it's less than 15%.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.400]   I'm gonna keep that in mind.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.440]   So here's what we're gonna go over today.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.840]   I'm gonna give you a quick background on me,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.680]   who I am, what motivates me.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.440]   Gonna give you a high-level view
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.760]   of what's happening in America
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.720]   when it comes to financial education.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.240]   And then I wanna spend a lot of time
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.440]   thinking about this group.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.960]   How do we mobilize Bogleheads
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.320]   who are so passionate and wanna give back?
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.560]   So I'm gonna give you a broad range of options
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.320]   in terms of how you can help.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.480]   And then, obviously, there'll be resources
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   available for you.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.160]   This slide looks different than it was originally.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.520]   Oh, here we go.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.440]   Starts lower left-hand corner.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.360]   I'm seven years old.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.040]   I'm the fifth child of six.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.920]   Our neighbor, Mrs. Madison, breaks her hip.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.680]   She needs somebody to walk her dog.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.880]   I'm the second youngest,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.360]   but my younger brother can't walk
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.960]   'cause he's only two, or he's only one.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   So I get to walk Mrs. Madison's dog.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.720]   I walk three times a day.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.760]   I'm in New Jersey, so we get the change of seasons.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.800]   Took a year for her hip to recover.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.960]   But every Friday, after I dropped her
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.280]   Jack Russell Terrier off,
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.760]   she would hand me a crisp $5 bill.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.520]   And I would walk a third of a mile
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.720]   to the United Jersey Bank on Hardinburg Avenue.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.040]   I would deposit that $5.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.480]   They'd stamp my passbook.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.680]   And at the dinner table,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.840]   my dad would ask to see my passbook.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.760]   We talked about money a lot,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.600]   and you'll find out why very shortly.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.840]   But that's a savings habit.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.480]   And thank God I got it at the age of seven
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.120]   because I had four older brothers and sisters.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.480]   And I saw very early on, if I wanted to go to college,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.000]   I was gonna have to basically pay my way
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.640]   'cause we were middle class.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.840]   Six kids, too many to pay for us to go to school,
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.200]   but not enough to get financial aid.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.280]   So it was very early on.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.640]   So when I hear people say, "Save 10%, save 20%,"
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.800]   I'm convinced my savings rate was about 98%.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   The reason being, my friends really started to wonder,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.240]   how come Tim always forgets his wallet?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.320]   (audience laughs)
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.560]   I'm paying them back now, so don't worry.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.600]   So that was the dog walking job.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.200]   There's a picture of my parents up there.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.400]   It couldn't have been better role models.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.320]   My father gave me work ethic.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.760]   No college degree, grew up in London during the Blitz.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.280]   Got sent to the countryside.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.120]   Very self-sufficient, Depression-era kid.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.440]   Rose up from bank teller to senior vice president
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.160]   of Barclays Bank in New York.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.680]   He also taught me how to ladder CDs
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.520]   'cause I had newspaper routes.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.880]   I was a golf caddy.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.600]   Five-year CDs, I still remember, thinking it was illegal.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.440]   (audience laughs)
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   15% interest, double your money in five years.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.160]   It was like crazy.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.960]   But again, all the adults are dealing with inflation.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.280]   I'm dealing with great interest rates.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.420]   So that really helped me get through college, too.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.220]   My mom, she taught me to give back.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.480]   Six kids weren't enough for her.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.800]   She was a Girl Scout troop leader.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.240]   She wrote the newsletter for the parish.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.400]   She visited soup kitchens, and she taught.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.280]   She must have had a 30- to 40-year career doing Story Hour.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.520]   When she passed, we went through her desk
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.460]   and we saw stacks of those.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.160]   You know those marble composition?
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.500]   My mom did lesson plans for Story Hour.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.420]   And she put, and it was kind of funny to read
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.460]   because it would be like, little Johnny's acting up.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.460]   I don't know how to exactly get Johnny's attention.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.940]   But this emphasis on what went well, what didn't go well.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.920]   And so I think she gave me the teaching gene
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.860]   because that was something that really mattered to her,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.780]   the idea of giving back.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.760]   So I had an opportunity to give back.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.480]   East Side College Prep is in East Palo Alto,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.900]   and it's a school serving first in their family,
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.780]   kids who want to be first in their family to go to college,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.720]   first-gen kids.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.540]   So I visit the campus, totally inspired by the founder
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.260]   because they send 100% of their kids to college.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.120]   These are kids first in their family to go,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.500]   primarily lower income, primarily black and brown students.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.340]   And I was so inspired.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.160]   How can I help?
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.820]   He said, "Well, you know something about finance, right?"
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.700]   I was like, "Yeah, sure, I'll do it."
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.780]   But I didn't know I was signing up for 25 hours
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.000]   of lessons with three sections of students,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.560]   and I didn't have a curriculum.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.780]   A lot of passion, but no curriculum.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.700]   Well, that experience, I saw two things.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.860]   I saw the eagerness that kids wanted to learn this.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.700]   Just incredible.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.300]   And then I think the secondary effect,
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.700]   and anybody who's taught young people know this.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.360]   They went home and told their parents.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.400]   So I went to a Schwab office to help open an IRA
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.960]   for one of the parents.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.120]   I got calls from, they wanted to discuss their budget.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.680]   I had a parent who called me like five years
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.600]   after I taught her son to say how proud she was
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.200]   that she knew what a target date fund was on a 401(k) list.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.040]   So I'm hooked.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.320]   I'm like, I did that for eight summers,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.640]   about halfway through teaching that,
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.920]   I said, "I gotta do something about this."
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.760]   And that's when I started NextGen Personal Finance.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.920]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   So every startup has to have a BHAG,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.140]   a big, hairy, audacious goal.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.120]   So in 2021, we got together as a team.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.240]   And frankly, the teachers were the ones,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.900]   we were just at lunch earlier today talking about
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.920]   how are we gonna get Maryland
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.800]   to require a personal finance.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.040]   When we hear enough teachers say,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.800]   we love this course, the students are benefiting,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.360]   but not enough of them are.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   So we set mission 2030.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.160]   And my thinking behind this is every high school student,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.480]   by the time they cross that graduation stage in 2030,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.640]   will have a one-semester personal finance course.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.240]   We did it in 2021.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.340]   So I did a little bit of research.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.000]   From the time Kennedy said, "Let's go to the moon,"
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.040]   to the time we did was about eight years.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.680]   We did it in 2021.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.460]   I'm thinking nine years.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.020]   Folks, this isn't rocket science.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.360]   This isn't rocket science, right?
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.200]   We know the curriculum.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.700]   We know teachers are eager to teach it.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.400]   Let's kind of make it happen.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.360]   Quickly, what we do.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.080]   Three legs of the stool.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.520]   I want it to be the one-stop shop for teachers.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.760]   So if you need a lesson, it's there.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.040]   If you want activities, it's there.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.640]   If you want games, it's there.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.880]   I wanted it to be kind of that one stop
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.640]   where teachers would go.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.640]   We have an arcade.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.760]   Games really matter, but games have to teach also.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.600]   So every one of those games has a reflection sheet.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.700]   They were played 10 million times last year.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.660]   The thing I'm most proud of
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.680]   is the teacher professional development.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.780]   So on the curriculum side,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.020]   90,000 teachers have signed up on our website.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.140]   I would say 2/3 of them come from word of mouth.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.300]   When something works in the classroom, teachers tell others.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.500]   The teacher professional development,
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.380]   in the last three, four years,
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.220]   17,000 teachers have spent on average 24 hours with us.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.820]   And so we have certification courses.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.260]   If you want to go deep and talk about investing
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.360]   or you want to go banking and budgeting
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.960]   or I teach a course in psychology of money,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.820]   we offer 12 of those courses.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.340]   And then we also have on-demands
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.980]   for people who want to be able to do things
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.740]   on their own time, their own pace.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.480]   And I'm gonna spend more time talking about advocacy.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.940]   So you see the bottom there, free and always will be.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.540]   So I created an endowment to fund our operation
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.740]   'cause frankly, I can't imagine a better investment to make
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.220]   than in the next generation
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.420]   and giving them the financial skills that they need.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.660]   So you all are welcome to go to the website
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.040]   to the extent that you're looking for resources
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.860]   to go out and teach, it's there.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:23.780]   So funny story, I'm in Salt Lake City,
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.340]   probably the second year of our company.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.300]   So we're still trying to figure things out.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.100]   How should we teach investing?
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.220]   Should we go and the whole, I think teachers will tell you
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.140]   investing is the most challenging subject for them to teach.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.740]   So gosh, if you could mentor teachers in your community
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.460]   to help them understand investing better,
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.300]   that would be awesome.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.000]   So anyway, I'm in a room full of teachers.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.020]   I'm doing a presentation about investing 100 teachers.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.280]   And I start by asking,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.820]   how many of you teach your students about index funds?
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.540]   If you look closely, there's one hand raised.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.680]   I think there were two others in the room.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.560]   There were about three out of 100.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.860]   And I said, okay, this is my mission.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.620]   Is every student, because guess what the most popular game
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.900]   in high schools is when it comes to investing?
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.700]   The stock market game.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.020]   Go ahead and Google how to win the stock market game
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.500]   and tell me that has anything to do
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.140]   with sound investing principles, right?
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.420]   High beta stocks, right around earnings, biotech's better.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.540]   And it's a short timeframe, right?
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.340]   And so if you go to our curriculum,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.740]   you'll see we spend a lot of time talking about index funds.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.660]   We talk about target date funds and really,
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.420]   because even if they're playing the stock market game,
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.620]   I want educators to feel like,
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.580]   okay, I can also teach a different approach
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.060]   because kids are naturally interested in stocks.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.620]   So you do have to spend a little bit of time
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.020]   talking about it, but clearly,
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.980]   'cause they'll often, that will be the first thing.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.620]   They know a company, right?
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.540]   Know what you're investing in,
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.820]   which probably can be a dangerous strategy.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.340]   My son loved Roblox.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.340]   So okay, how much do you love it?
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.220]   Why don't we put $50 in and buy some Roblox?
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.940]   Yeah, he now understands volatility.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.180]   Which kind of gets to the point here.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.700]   Those of you who have children or grandchildren,
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.660]   like how do I talk about investing with young people?
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.500]   And so the strategy I've used with my son
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.100]   is basically the 50/50 method.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.140]   You know what?
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.500]   Pick companies you're interested in.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.780]   So let him, 'cause he's gonna be naturally,
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.100]   he's gonna care about that, right?
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.940]   And then I'm gonna take the other half
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.700]   and we're gonna put it in an index fund.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.740]   And we're gonna look at it every quarter
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.260]   to get him understand.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.260]   And the good news is I got him hooked on stocks in 2021.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.700]   Wasn't that great timing?
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.740]   He learned a great lesson about how those high-flying,
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.340]   pandemic-driven stocks that did really well
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.220]   didn't perform so well.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.580]   So I think he's an index fund now guy too.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.580]   So here's the progress that's been happening.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.700]   This is what you're seeing here is the number of states
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.180]   that either through their legislature
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.060]   or through their State Department of Education
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.660]   require every high school student in the state
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.700]   to take a personal finance course.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.220]   So the shorthand here is in a little over
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.220]   two and a half, three years,
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.980]   we've gone from eight to 23 states.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.860]   So tripling.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.740]   The next state, which is just waiting
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.100]   for the Wisconsin governor's signature,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.380]   will put us over 50% mark.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.420]   So more than one out of every two students
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.980]   will take a personal finance course
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.540]   just with the states on the board.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.540]   Now it takes time for them to implement,
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.380]   usually three, four year implementation period.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.700]   We're working with them on curriculum
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.420]   and professional development.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.620]   But yeah, the world has changed pretty rapidly.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.260]   How many people, not many people thought it was 15% or higher
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.540]   now you're hearing it's 50%.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.220]   I think there's, it's happened so quickly.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.340]   So you're probably interested
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.420]   in what's happening in my state,
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.020]   what's happening in your state.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.540]   So the dark blue are states,
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.220]   those are like the original eight,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.620]   they've had it in place the longest.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.140]   The lighter shade are states
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.340]   where they're in the process of implementing.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.700]   And so again, if you're in any of those states
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.140]   that are in the process of implementing,
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.140]   they're probably very interested in talking to people
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.700]   who might be able to assist kind of at the school level.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.460]   And then I'll talk about ways to get engaged
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.220]   for the states that don't have any boxes around them.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.820]   So maybe you're curious, not about your state,
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.780]   but you're curious about your school community.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.860]   Every year we hire Montana State University,
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.060]   they go through 12,000 high school course catalogs
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.700]   to identify what is happening in the school
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.900]   around personal finance.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.740]   If it's gold, 'cause this happens at the grassroots level.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.140]   Great story out of Massachusetts,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.220]   Sue Camperotto who teaches at Swampscott High School,
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.460]   16 year odyssey,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.820]   got personal finance to be a graduation requirement.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.340]   That's the passion that educators have to make this happen.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.860]   So if you wanna go figure out
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.340]   what's happening in your school,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.420]   if you Google got finance,
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.500]   how many of you remember the Got Milk campaign?
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.340]   I gotta tell you, I'm the oldest person at our company
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.620]   and I said got finance and nobody really got it.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.940]   So that's just Google got finance question mark
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.260]   and it'll take you to that map.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.780]   So let's talk about the role that you can play.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.460]   And I've kind of given you a continuum of options here
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.820]   from on the left hand side, go in and teach a lesson.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.860]   And I'll tell you the best network
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.540]   is the school your child goes to,
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.740]   'cause that's gonna,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.860]   a school where you know who the economics teacher is
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.940]   or even the personal finance,
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.140]   you're gonna know what's being taught in your school.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.220]   Obviously, if you have a student there,
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.820]   but if you're going into a school cold,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.740]   you'll have the information from the website.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.000]   On the far end, I'd say the most dramatic role
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.180]   I've seen an individual play,
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.420]   this was a financial planner out of Minnesota,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.300]   Steve Lear.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.180]   He said, I really want this to happen in Minnesota,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.140]   so I'm gonna go out and pay for a lobbyist
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.100]   to make it happen.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.300]   And you know what?
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.580]   It happened in Minnesota this year.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.860]   So that's on the far end on the advocacy front.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.140]   So really important point
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.640]   for those of you who haven't been into a classroom,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.080]   attention spans are short.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.740]   So 10 years ago, I'm in front of,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.660]   it was probably 12 years ago,
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.100]   I'm in front of these ninth graders
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.700]   and I'm like, I cannot wait to tell them
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.860]   everything in my brain and just distill it to them
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.400]   and share all my wisdom with them.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.940]   And about five minutes in, I'm like, I lost them.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.780]   It's over.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.260]   You gotta come with an activity.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.260]   You gotta come with something to do.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.820]   And I'm happy to share these resources with you.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.980]   And I've given you both no tech options
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.180]   as well as tech options.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.580]   So just real quickly, the bean game,
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.900]   really simple game.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.300]   You have 20 beans, or they can be pennies
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.540]   or any manipulative.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.980]   And you got two sheets of paper with things
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.980]   that you would expect to see in a budget.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.620]   And you gotta allocate the 20 beans,
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.140]   needs versus wants, resource constraints.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.040]   And then you throw the wild card in that,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.040]   oh, guess what, your pay got cut from 20 to 13.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.420]   Go pull seven beans off the,
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.460]   then you really understand wants versus needs.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.700]   The bean game, extremely popular.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.260]   Another one, let's make a mutual fund.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.460]   Kids do not understand what a mutual fund is.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.460]   It's not kind of this natural thing
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.380]   that they've ever experienced.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.860]   So we have a get out of the seat game.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.140]   Every student is given a ticker symbol.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.540]   And then we ask them to form special groups.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.660]   Go find somebody else with a similar ticket.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.100]   And we have the returns on the flip side.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.540]   Pair up, there's two of them.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.360]   Go find two other pairs.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.660]   Now there's six of them.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.300]   And then it ends up, it works well with a group of 30,
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.900]   because guess what happens when they all get together?
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.120]   What index are they?
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.580]   The Dow Jones.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.540]   Now we obviously make the point that very few people
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.580]   invest in the Dow Jones index,
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.820]   but it gives them idea of what diversification looks like.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.580]   So that's, let's make a mutual fund.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.500]   On the tech side, one of my favorite interactives,
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.680]   because index funds, I think mutual funds are hard.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.980]   Index funds are pretty difficult too.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   There's a website called finviz.com, F-I-N-V-I-Z.com.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.400]   It's a market map of the S&P 500.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.840]   So I think a lot of teachers will put it up on the board
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.720]   when they're teaching investing.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.940]   And you see, how did those 500 stocks perform?
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.940]   The size of the box is the market cap of the company.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.340]   Gives you red versus green, what's up, what's down.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.660]   And then it has a toggle on the left-hand side.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.180]   So this was a terrible day in the market,
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.700]   but when we look three, six, 12 months out,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.120]   it's a very different picture.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.620]   Very easy to talk about short versus long-term.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.060]   So that's finviz.com.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.220]   We also have a game called Stacks.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.480]   We needed to do the impossible.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.220]   We needed to create an exciting game about index funds.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.440]   It's like watching paint dry, right?
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.500]   So what we do is we give them seven different asset classes
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.480]   and they're trading like crazy.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.340]   And in the background,
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.760]   they're competing against the computer.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.400]   Guess what the computer's doing?
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.360]   Dollar cost averaging in the index funds.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.720]   They lose about 90% of the time.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.600]   It's a perfect lead-in to say,
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.900]   how stressed do you feel
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.400]   after 20 years of investing in 20 minutes?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.380]   So that's our game, Stacks.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.180]   Our most popular game in the arcade.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.560]   The next thing you do
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.820]   is you could start an investment club.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.160]   So I'm gonna ask, actually,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.400]   one of our educators, Julius Przewski,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.040]   and he's gonna talk about an investment club
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.680]   he runs at his high school in Baltimore.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.520]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:25.180]   - Here, let me give you this.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.020]   - Okay.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.220]   - Okay.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.300]   - Kind of attached here.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.760]   So I teach personal finance
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.560]   in a private high school in Baltimore.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.100]   It started about eight years ago.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.040]   We started with an elective.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.440]   Within two years, we had seven sections,
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.540]   and then at that point, they were like,
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.920]   well, we just should make it mandatory
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.400]   'cause almost everybody takes it.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.440]   So we are mandatory.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.240]   It's a one-semester course.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.880]   As Tid said, we teach investing,
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.840]   but in a one-semester course,
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.440]   you don't have a lot of time to teach about stocks.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.180]   So I decided that I would do an investment club.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.880]   So we have an activity period,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.400]   and once a week, we meet,
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.200]   and we have about 65 boys in the group,
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.600]   and we come in, and I've used MarketWatch
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.040]   for the investment game,
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.920]   and I just set the criteria at about $100,000
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.560]   that each kid could invest,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.040]   and then we just make 'em go long.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.200]   I don't let 'em do shorts or anything like that.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.840]   We don't let 'em buy on margin or anything like that,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.200]   and then I try to just teach 'em
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.840]   with just different short PowerPoints
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.120]   on why do you invest in certain stocks,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.680]   when would you sell those stocks,
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.360]   because what we find is that, like as Tim said,
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   mutual funds can be very boring, obviously,
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.840]   and an index fund is not exciting,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.920]   but Tim, you gave me a good idea.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.860]   I let the boys go for three months,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.440]   and then we have the winners get some free lunches,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.420]   but now I'm gonna make 'em pick an index fund
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.800]   on the other side of it,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.540]   and then kinda go, well, can we beat the index fund
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.720]   in a set period of time?
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.880]   But the kids, I think, need to learn
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   that investing short-term is a little bit like gambling,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.080]   'cause a lot of our kids today
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.360]   have the gambling accounts with sports,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.040]   and I see that on their phone all the time,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.200]   and I'm like, okay, well,
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.600]   we need to learn the good and the bad,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.960]   and I think sometimes losing
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.520]   is a great way to learn about investing,
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.380]   and I tell 'em, hey, guys, I've lost money in investing,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.680]   I've made money in investing,
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.280]   but now I don't pick Singleton stocks anymore.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.520]   I'm a Boglehead, I'm in Vanguard,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.200]   so I kinda think that's the best way to go about it,
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.600]   is to get them involved and do it with fictitious money,
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.080]   but show 'em that most of these kids don't make money
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.840]   at the end of the three- to four-month period,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.400]   and they're like, yeah, this is a lot harder than I thought.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.780]   Awesome, thanks.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.780]   (audience applauds)
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:47.180]   - Thanks, Julius.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.240]   All right, if you wanna go a little bit further,
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.840]   you teach a course, and I would recommend,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.000]   and we have free, I told you everything we do is free.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   Come to our professional development
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.580]   and collaborate with other educators
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.220]   and figure out what's working in the class,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.780]   but we have scope and sequence,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.440]   which means we lay out our lessons and how to teach them,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.820]   and they're very interactive.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.200]   I think a lot of people get intimidated
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   because like, oh, I gotta be the sage on stage.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.780]   What if they start asking me all these questions?
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.600]   And the thing I learned very early on as an educator,
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.240]   which I think was the most powerful thing I learned,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.340]   was when they asked a question I didn't know,
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.000]   I'd say, let's figure this out together, right?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.440]   'Cause we've never had better tools
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.680]   to go out and find information,
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.920]   because they need to understand also that,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.400]   I guess the other thing I would say,
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.700]   which I should have mentioned earlier,
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.840]   is there's a heavy emphasis.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   Our first unit in our course
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.960]   is behavioral economics.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.680]   Let's let students grapple with their relationship
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   with money before we dive into all of the details.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.720]   Let's talk about all the cognitive biases we have,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.640]   which make it difficult for us to do the thing we should do.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.540]   Let's also develop a level of empathy,
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:10.000]   because you might decide you wanna buy lottery tickets,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.440]   and if I come in as the educator and say, that's dumb,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.680]   let's, why don't you invest that in an index fund?
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.220]   I think it's Morgan Housel's book,
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.300]   which I can't recommend enough, "Psychology of Money."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.920]   I think it's his first or second chapter.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.240]   He says, put yourself in somebody else's shoes.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.720]   I'm working three jobs, minimum wage.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.100]   That $2 ticket I buy is called hope.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.640]   So be careful about judging.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.540]   Not a lot of shoulds.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.160]   I don't think a lot of shoulds
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.040]   should be part of personal finance,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:41.880]   because you're gonna turn,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   I think this was mentioned earlier,
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.000]   if you're too sanctimonious,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.880]   you're gonna turn people off, right?
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.840]   So understand, somebody said this, I forget who,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.520]   but I think it rings really true.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.200]   Every decision, every decision makes sense, right?
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.440]   When you look at somebody else's decision,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.760]   say, how could you make that?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.480]   Every decision makes sense with enough information.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.440]   I had a conversation with a teacher.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.600]   She said, I always lease cars, what do you do?
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.620]   I told her, I buy cars,
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.400]   and I run 'em into the ground 20 years later.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.360]   You dig a little bit deeper into somebody who leases cars,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.860]   she says, oh, I was traveling five, six years ago,
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.320]   and car broke down, we had to get a tow truck
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.800]   to bring us back to where we need.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.840]   I mean, she had a traumatic experience with an older car.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.680]   So she vowed in her head, three to four years
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.800]   is all I wanna run a car for.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.000]   And I could say, well, but the economics say this.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.440]   And so I think this empathy is incredibly important
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.240]   when you're teaching this class.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.300]   Don't reinvent the wheel.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.140]   There's a lot of high-quality curricula out there.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.640]   Ours is customizable, too.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.180]   So we do it in Google Docs.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.220]   You file, make a copy, you can change it as you like.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.940]   Expect the unexpected.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.580]   And I think any long-term educator will tell you,
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.300]   embrace continuous improvement.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.600]   It doesn't always go well.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.620]   But I always thought, I was teaching three sections in a row,
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.020]   and I was a lot better with the third section
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.460]   than I was with the first.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.940]   Those reps, just thinking, okay,
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.740]   how do I make this a little bit better, a little bit better?
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.380]   You do that over a career,
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.020]   and you're a rockstar teacher, right?
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.980]   Continuous improvement.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.760]   Just like my mom taking notes
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.480]   in about 100 different Marble notebooks.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.220]   Men are a teacher.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.100]   They tell us investing is the most challenging subject
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.340]   for them to teach, right?
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:30.840]   And maybe we can help facilitate that.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.420]   Again, this is the problem with an entrepreneur.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.660]   They just immediately like, what if we created a list
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.320]   of bogleheads who want a men are a teacher?
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   We match with our 90,000 teacher account base,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.760]   and try and make some of those matches.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.320]   'Cause it can be difficult if you're not,
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.960]   you know, if your kids aren't in the school system,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.800]   or you're further away.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.600]   So maybe that's an idea we'll explore.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.000]   But I know they would, I'll turn to my teachers.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.680]   What do you think?
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.760]   All right, you know where they're sitting.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.140]   And the last is advocacy.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:07.800]   So I remember in 2021 thinking this was the craziest thing.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   I just got tired of people saying,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.480]   everybody should be taught personal finance,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.840]   but nobody was really, had figured out a strategy
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.240]   as to how to go ahead and do it.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.400]   And I love this Margaret Mead quote,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.180]   because it really is a small group of committed people
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.720]   that are in this community,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.680]   this personal finance education community.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.440]   And there's a small group of people on a relative basis
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.280]   that are bogleheads.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.480]   But together, the power is just intense.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.760]   So I'll give you two choices here.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.960]   Anybody ever attend, anybody school board members here?
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.040]   All right, thank you for your service.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.780]   So it often starts at the school board level.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.600]   You wanna, you gotta build a coalition though, folks.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.400]   You can't just show up and will something to happen.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.840]   Find the teacher in the school
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.280]   who's really passionate about it.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.120]   Find students, do a student survey.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.920]   One of the reasons this thing is happening
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.320]   at such a rapid pace is when you survey, it's 80% approval.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.400]   80% approval.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.280]   Tell me another subject in this polarized world we live in
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.100]   that 80% of people agree on.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:23.240]   It's not bipartisan, it's nonpartisan and it's common sense.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.080]   So we've got resources available
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.320]   in terms of the research that says it works,
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.300]   the PowerPoints that make the convincing points.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.120]   And also how do you overcome objections?
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.080]   'Cause there are a lot of them.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.920]   And then on the state legislature front,
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.540]   again, you're kind of upping your game even more.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.400]   We track every year legislation.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.360]   I think in the past year, there were about 30 states
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.360]   that had 70 or 80 bills around financial literacy.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.760]   Some of them are window dressing
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.580]   because the politicians know this is popular.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.640]   They'll get a press release out
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.200]   that they introduced this bill.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.560]   But some of them are serious.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.440]   And if the legislators, you've got state senators
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.540]   and you've got state representatives,
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.980]   the action here is at the state, not at the federal level.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.480]   But smaller states,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.000]   you probably know your representative really well.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.760]   We've got model legislation.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.320]   We have kind of best practices
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.160]   in terms of how you think about.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.320]   And I think the power of us,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.920]   next gen personal finance advocating
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.160]   is not only are we looking for legislative solutions,
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.280]   but we're there to support them for implementation.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.240]   'Cause that's always the hangup.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.200]   New graduation requirements don't come along very often.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.360]   So they're looking for a partner
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.520]   who can do it at no cost, which we offer.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.760]   So get to know your legislator,
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.320]   let them know this is important.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.480]   And then you have opportunities.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.040]   Usually the first stop in the legislature
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.160]   is the education committee.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.020]   They'll hold a hearing.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.160]   And that's when parents, teachers, and students
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.040]   steal the show.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.920]   Because these students have so much gravitas
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.060]   and they're so passionate about making this happen.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.360]   I can point to Wisconsin,
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.800]   Florida, no, it wasn't Florida.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.680]   Three or four states where kids just lined up,
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.840]   two hours of kids talking about why this is so important.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.920]   It leaves an impression on politicians.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.180]   And then the last is you can be like Steve
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.080]   and hire a lobbyist.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.000]   So to get from eight to 23,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   what we realized, we had a grassroots effort.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.960]   We gave Sue Camperotto a grant
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.760]   because she made it a requirement in her school.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.600]   And we probably gave 150 of those grants.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.240]   But we discovered two and a half years ago,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   when companies want to affect policy, what do they do?
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.160]   They hire lobbyists.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.180]   So in the last two years, we hired 25 lobbyists
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.960]   and about half have gotten over the finish line.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.160]   'Cause we realized this is how you create change.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.600]   And it's the lobbyists and the combination
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.680]   of the educators and the students who make a difference.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:08.560]   - So we have some questions for you.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.460]   - Sure. - You ready?
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.300]   - Yep. - Okay.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.600]   Okay.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   So a lot of the material, it seems,
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.020]   that is used in financial education in schools
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:28.020]   is sponsored product-driven propaganda.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.880]   - Yeah, no, that's--
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   - Can you tell me, first of all, is that true?
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.040]   And if so, how do you stop that?
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.240]   - Yeah, I would just say we're winning that battle.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.120]   So we hired an independent third party
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   to go out and ask teachers what curriculum they use.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.160]   And the good news is I think our share was over 80, 85%.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   So our best, I guess our best weapon against that
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.940]   is providing great curriculum that's not sponsored.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.260]   Again, we're fully endowed,
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.300]   so we're not raising money
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.740]   from financial institutions either.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.940]   Because frankly, that's one of the challenges in the space.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.440]   And I think if you give teachers a non-commercial option
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.220]   that doesn't have Big Bank emblazoned on it,
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.020]   I think they'll choose ours.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.900]   - Another question about investing.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.460]   So you're talking about investing today generally,
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:28.460]   but how about budgeting, emergency fund,
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.860]   is all that part of the curriculum also?
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.360]   - So we have 10 units in our semester course.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.180]   So it's all the managing credit,
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.760]   types of credit, budgeting, psychology of money,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.000]   consumer skills, like there's this thing
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.320]   called dark patterns, right?
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.740]   Like websites that get you to do things
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.960]   that you really shouldn't do.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.460]   But so there's the full gamut.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.460]   The other thing is we supplement with current events.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.180]   So when GameStop took off,
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.860]   we've got a phenomenal teammate
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.980]   who you saw in the video very briefly, Yaneli Espinel,
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.560]   she creates a weekly current events video with a quiz.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.700]   So we can also fill in the gaps when the world changes,
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.460]   whether it's Silicon Valley Bank imploding
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.460]   or all banks at risk to GameStop, to crypto.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.100]   So the other thing we're really attuned to,
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.940]   you gotta be current.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.060]   And again, we have this great feedback loop here
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.620]   of these educators coming in and telling us,
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.100]   here's what kids are talking about.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.780]   And it would blow your mind.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.940]   For X trading, are you kidding me?
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.760]   Well, guess what?
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.040]   76% of kids are getting financial advice from social media.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.940]   So that's the other reason I think
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.640]   we have a lot of momentum behind this,
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.900]   is if we don't provide a foundational course,
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.740]   they're being fed to the wolves, right?
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.260]   Get rich quick.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.900]   - So there's something called just-in-time education.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.060]   And there are studies that show just-in-time education
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.500]   works better than teaching them in a class.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.420]   Can you comment on that?
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.940]   - Yeah, I think when you stop and think about high school,
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.700]   and actually it's on my last slide.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.420]   When you think about the decisions young persons making
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.880]   in high school, there is a lot of just-in-time.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.620]   Your parents hand you the keys to the car,
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.140]   better understand auto insurance.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.660]   You may have gotten your first part-time job.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.960]   Gotta learn how to read a pay stub.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.900]   Why didn't I get 3.25 per hour?
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.740]   That was my first job.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.800]   I remember the sense of revulsion I had.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Like, what do you mean I'm not getting 3.25 an hour?
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.640]   So that's part of it.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.020]   Paying taxes is another.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.260]   And probably the most important decision
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.100]   kids are gonna make is staring them right in the face.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.460]   What am I gonna do after high school?
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.680]   And so we've got an entire unit on paying for college,
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.540]   but also alternatives to college to provide the full view.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.300]   So I would argue, I agree with just-in-time.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.080]   And I think you gotta create a curriculum.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.460]   Our high school curriculum is just-in-time
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.740]   in terms of all these decisions.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.380]   - Okay, last question we have time for,
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.180]   and this is a good one.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:56.940]   What if you're not in one of those 23 states
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.420]   and you have a student or know someone
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.900]   who would like to take this class?
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.180]   Can you do it online even though
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.140]   you're not in one of the states?
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:10.180]   - Yeah, so I think it's, we really focus on teacher-led.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.740]   And so find a teacher in the high school.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.940]   And again, when you come to them and say,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.500]   hey, there's a curriculum and there's folks
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.700]   who will help train you around professional development,
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.100]   that's available, 'cause that's kind of our focus.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.660]   So this isn't student-facing per se.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.420]   Our distribution channel is really educators
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   'cause the scale that you get,
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.380]   every educator teaches on average 100 kids.
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.300]   And so that was kind of the path we chose.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.000]   How many Californians in the room?
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.100]   Okay, you're gonna have a chance in November of 2024,
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.980]   we're working to get a personal finance education
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.260]   requirement on the ballot
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.060]   because the California legislature
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.100]   has spent two decades dithering
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.380]   and there's a 450,000 kids who graduate every year
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.860]   from California high schools that deserve this.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.740]   So the states that aren't up there,
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.860]   there's about 10 of them we're lobbying in
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.020]   for the next year.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.780]   And so you can expect, look for the bill tracker.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.020]   That'll tell you when the bill gets introduced
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.020]   and then reach out to me, tim@ngpf.org
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.820]   and we'll get you involved.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.860]   - Tim, we're grateful for you to come in today
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.700]   and tell us what you're doing.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.100]   I think you're a fantastic job.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.860]   I'm so glad we, the Vogelhead community,
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.780]   can be part of this.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.780]   Thank you very much.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.780]   - Thank you.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:30.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
