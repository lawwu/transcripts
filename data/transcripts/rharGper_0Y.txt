[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   Do you have a feeling on how far MT goes?
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.200]   Do you think that human level MT is realistic?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.280]   It's funny when you talk about companies wanting quality guarantees.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.720]   I would think just having used a lot of Google Translate in my life, quality guarantees seem
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.040]   like would be useful, but also it just seems like the quality of Google Translate just
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.620]   isn't good enough that I would want to put that on my website generally.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.960]   Do you expect that that is likely to change?
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.960]   I guess I can offer some assorted comments on thinking about that.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.960]   Please.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   Thank you.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.160]   In no particular order, because I think there are both technical and social issues to do
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160]   with that.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160]   And I think there's some philosophical issues.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.880]   So let's start with the philosophical issue.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.160]   Translation is in this sort of space of so-called AI complete problems.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.280]   So solving it would be equivalent to the advent of strong AI, if you will.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.160]   Because for any particular translation problem, world knowledge is required to solve the problem.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.400]   And there are inputs that are not in the string that are required to produce a translation
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400]   in another language.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.220]   Although, sorry to cut you off, but I guess it feels like based on what I've seen lately
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.680]   from Google Translate that it feels like less AI complete than I would have thought.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   Yes.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.340]   So that's the next comment that I'll make, which is that philosophical statement doesn't
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.720]   mean that within business settings, you should not be using it.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560]   So one space we've been looking at recently is like crypto.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.680]   Well, four months ago, nobody knew what a non-fungible token is.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.880]   So how do you translate that into Swahili and Korean?
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.740]   Well, an empty system is not going to give you the answer to that question because language
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.740]   is productive.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.040]   People are making new words all the time and machines are not making up new words all the
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   time.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   People are.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.520]   And so philosophically, you've got to have training data for the system to be able to
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.680]   produce a result.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.480]   People do not need training data to do that.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   But then I think increasingly, there are a lot of business settings where it's good enough
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   to solve the problem.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.320]   So if you go for years, you can go to Airbnb and look at a flat and click translate with
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.600]   Google and it'll give you a translation.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.560]   It may not be perfect, but it's certainly enough to convince you you want to buy this,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   rent this flat.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.720]   And I think there will be more and more cases where fully automatic machine translation
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080]   solves the business problem at hand.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.240]   I think that's absolutely true.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.480]   And then I think there's a third part of it, which is sort of social and organizational,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.840]   which is how soon, VP of marketing, are you willing to let raw machine translation go
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   on your landing page with no oversight?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.240]   And that's one way to think about that is like, how soon are you Lucas ready for a machine
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.880]   to respond to all of your email?
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   All of my own email?
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well, I have to say-
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.960]   Some of it probably sure, but like other parts of it, a little bit dangerous.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.000]   If you're enjoying Gradient Dissent, I'd really love for you to check out Fully Connected,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.280]   which is an inclusive machine learning community that we're building to let everyone know about
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.440]   all the stuff going on in ML and all the new research coming out.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.840]   If you go to WMB.ai/fc, you can see all the different stuff that we do, including Gradient
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.480]   Dissent, but also salons where we talk about new research and folks share insights, AMAs
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.840]   where you can directly connect with members of our community, and a Slack channel where
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.560]   you can get answers to everything from very basic questions about ML to bug reports on
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.400]   weights and biases to how to hire an ML team.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.520]   We're looking forward to meeting you.
