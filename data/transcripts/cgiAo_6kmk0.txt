[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Okay, and final question, since this is our user conference and you are such a high profile
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.840]   user of OpenAI, I'm curious if you could say a little bit about how OpenAI uses Weights
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.920]   and Biases and if you have a favorite feature or part of Weights and Biases.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.120]   We'd love to know about that.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.080]   Yeah, I mean, we use it for pretty much all of our model training.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.240]   So just tracking them, I think there's a lot of just sharing of like, the fact that you
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.400]   can easily share training runs and stuff like that, it's a super used feature.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.440]   But I think one thing that these days I do way, way less of that sort of work.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.400]   So one of the features I really like is the ability to have reports and so on where people...
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   So we use that quite heavily.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.900]   It depends a little bit on the team, but a number of teams are using that quite heavily
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.280]   to kind of really have a clear hypothesis.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.880]   Here's the hypothesis, here are the experiments that were run to kind of validate or invalidate
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.800]   that hypothesis, here's the conclusion.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.040]   You have all these mini scientific papers, essentially, on all of the stuff that's happening
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.400]   at OpenAI, which is incredibly interesting to follow along with.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   Fantastic.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.280]   That sounds very interesting.
