[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.560]   We have a quick deep dive today on yet another practical question.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.760]   When should tasks live on my calendar?
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.480]   Now, if you've heard me talk about my varied productivity systems before,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.120]   you know that the obligations in my life I tend to keep on task boards.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.440]   I use the tool Trello. I have a different task board for each role in my professional life.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.200]   I have one card for each obligation. Relevant information is attached to the card. The cards
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.480]   are sorted under columns that dictate the status or category of that obligation.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.560]   All right, and that's all fine. I look at those when I do my weekly plan. And in theory,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.960]   I have admin blocks during the week where I go and look at those task boards and pull out the
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.080]   appropriate task. And this is all good. You don't want these to exist just in your head. That's a
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.960]   good place to keep them. However, there's a non-trivial fraction of my tasks that actually
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.120]   do not exist on that task board, but instead on my calendar. I use Google Calendar. So typically,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.840]   they will exist for me on a given day as what's known as an all-day event. So it's a little
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.600]   event that appears just at the top of the day, not at a particular time.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.960]   So the question is, what type of tasks do I put on my calendar instead of my task board? Well,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.400]   to help answer this question, I have actually loaded my calendar in front of me. I did not
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.560]   prepare for this. I'm doing this on the fly. I have my calendar right here in front of me.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960]   I'm going to go back in the future and back in time a little bit. And let's just look at the
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.520]   type of tasks I have on my calendar. All right, so like today, I had a scheduling task. There's a
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   medical appointment I needed to schedule. I couldn't schedule it too far in advance,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.480]   and there was a note on my calendar for today to do that. And I did schedule that today.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:09.440]   Let's see what else we have on here. Plan. Okay, so there was a change to our podcast recording
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.240]   planning. So at some point, I knew the day that we were going to record, that Jesse and I were
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.480]   going to be in the studio wasn't going to work. And I put a note on my calendar to come up with
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   an alternative plan and talk to Jesse about it. So that was something that was on my calendar.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.240]   Okay, I'm looking at real calendars here. Posting a problem set. This was last Wednesday. The new
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.640]   problem set for the students in my class at Georgetown has to be posted. Check with our admin
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.480]   about these graduate student TA job advertisements. So I had posted this information, or she was
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.360]   posting this information, and I had put a note on my calendar to follow up with her on given
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.480]   information. Let's find one more here. Send slides for a speaking client. Send them slides.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.760]   All right, so what do these examples have in common? In all of these cases, there's
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.320]   their tasks, what I know when they need to be executed within a several day period.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   Like send slides. That's the day either that they're due, or I know it's the next day I have
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.600]   time to actually get those slides together. Follow up with our admin about those TA job
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.880]   posting announcements. Well, I knew when I sent all that information in that I should follow up
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.360]   in a week. So it was very time specific. Let's wait a week and then follow up on what's going on.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.720]   That's why that existed on that particular day. Post the problem set. That actually had to happen
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.640]   on that day. I post them on the specific days. It's listed on the syllabus when they're posted.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.560]   So it's a reminder that this is the day that problem set is going to be posted. I mentioned
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.880]   before the schedule, the podcast, schedule the podcast, plan, change. You know, my vague memory
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.120]   is that it came over the transom, the thing that was going to interrupt our schedule, but I was in
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.200]   the middle of a bunch of things. But I knew it was really important. So I put it on my calendar,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.600]   like this is what I should do first thing Monday. And the final example I gave was scheduling this
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.240]   medical appointment. You could only schedule two weeks out. So I remember when I figured out,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.440]   okay, I need to schedule this for the beginning of December. I went to my calendar to what's the
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.200]   day I'll be able to do that. Okay, let me put the note there. So in all of these cases, these examples
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.960]   I just took from my real calendar of tasks that exist just on my calendar, and not on my task
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   boards, they were all things that needed to happen within a relatively specific window.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.800]   Having them on the calendar, I think is a really reasonable way of doing it. Because for me,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   like a lot of knowledge workers, the one thing I know is going to be looked at all day long
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   is my calendar, because I have a lot of appointments and meetings and talks and whatever.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.280]   I got to look at my calendar, or I'm just hosed. There's no there's no way I can not look at my
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.360]   calendar, I could go a day or two without looking at my task board, I'd be fine. If I go a day
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.240]   without looking at my calendar, I'm going to miss five things. And so that's like not a bad place
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.600]   for it to be. Second, the second advantage of this is that it's well suited for weekly planning. So
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   when it comes time to do weekly planning for a week, you look at your task boards, you look at
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.520]   your calendar, but your task boards, you know, there's lots of things on there. But when you
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.480]   look at your calendar, the tasks that are living on your calendar for that week have now been
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.840]   highlighted, underlined flashing, these have to happen this week.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.120]   When you're thinking of your weekly plan, you then integrate those things into your weekly plan,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.280]   now you probably would see it in your task board when you're going to your task board for preparing
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.760]   for your weekly plan. But there's a lot of things on your task board. And you know, you might miss
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.000]   it that I had this thing really probably should happen this week. Or in some cases, you know,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.440]   it could happen whenever but you've decided I really want to get this done before the end of
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.600]   the month. So let me put a note on a particular week. There's a psychology here, where you feel
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.320]   better about this thing, this will get taken care of, it's time sensitive. I always look at my
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.680]   calendar, I do my weekly plan, I look at my calendar every day, this will not be forgotten,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.840]   this will be taken care of. The step back, there is nothing fundamental about this strategy. In
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.240]   other words, there's nothing that just looking at your task board at the beginning of each week,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.680]   pulling out the things that are due that week, having a good admin check in most days, all of
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.760]   that on paper will take care of all of these issues. But I feel a lot better. I feel a lot
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   better to have the stuff that is time sensitive, actually live on my calendar near those times,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.840]   it's a two tier system, there's a time sensitive task and the semi non time sensitive tasks,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.720]   they exist in different worlds. This balance seems to work well for me. Again, I would probably be
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.680]   fine without the calendar in if that's a word, probably be fine. But I do get a lot of psychological
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.520]   comfort knowing that that problem set that needs to be posted that plan that needs to be changed
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.800]   right away. And that medical appointment that has to be made, knowing that that will 100% be seen
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:58.080]   and get executed when it needs to be executed.
