[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   You can imagine a level of technological development where there just aren't new
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.280]   things to find, and there isn't a lot of new growth to have, and people aren't dying,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.640]   because that seems like it should be medically possible for people not to age or die.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.080]   And so you can imagine a lot of the sources of dynamism in the world
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.080]   actually going away if we had enough technology. You could imagine a government
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.920]   that was able to actually surveil everyone, which is not something you can do now,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.920]   with a dictator who actually doesn't age or die, who knows everything going on,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.840]   who's able to respond to everything, and then you could imagine that world just being completely
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.760]   stable. I think this is a very scary thought, and it's something we have to be mindful of,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800]   that if the rate of technological progress speeds up a lot, we could quickly get to a world that
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.040]   doesn't have a lot more dynamism, and is a lot more. I think when you think about,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.800]   if you imagine that we're going to get this explosion in scientific and technological
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   advancement, I think you have to take pretty seriously the idea that could end by hitting a
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.600]   wall, that there could not be a lot of room for more dynamism, and that we could have these kind
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.280]   kind of very stable societies.
