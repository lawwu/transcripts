[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.680]   in the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the third chapter and the first two verses.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.760]   The first two verses in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.400]   Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.840]   of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip the tetrarch of Aeturia,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.800]   and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, Caiaphas, Annas,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:48.840]   and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.880]   in the wilderness.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.840]   Now we've been engaged for a number of Sunday evenings in considering the message of the
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.400]   Bible to the world, to the world today, to the modern man, to men as he is in his predicament
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800]   this evening.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.560]   In a sense we have of course been considering what you may call the history of redemption,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.020]   or the drama of redemption.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.520]   And we have been doing so in order to show that the Bible, far from being what so many
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.200]   think it is today, namely an old book, which of course because of certain traditional associations
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.480]   has its interest and its charm and its fascination, but which because of its age and its antiquity
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   is quite irrelevant to the modern man and to the modern world, and has rarely nothing
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.080]   to say to us which is of any value at the present time.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.600]   Our whole endeavor has been to show that the Bible on the contrary is the most up-to-date
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.520]   book in the world because it is the only book that rarely has an insight into the modern
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   situation.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.680]   Now that last hymn has been putting it very well again, that in spite of what God has
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.360]   done that man is still at war with men.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.600]   The history of the last two thousand years has been almost identical with the history
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.440]   of the four thousand years that went before that.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.300]   In working our way through the Old Testament we have seen that constantly, that the situation
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.960]   remains the same.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.440]   And of course it is of the very essence of the biblical message to say that the situation
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   still remains the same, that we are all misled by the superficialities, and misled to such
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.720]   an extent that we fail to see that the problem of men is an unchanging problem, that it has
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.560]   continued and persisted throughout the long history of civilization.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.360]   And we have been saying that according to the Bible the real trouble with men, and in
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.880]   a sense his only trouble, is this, that he does not listen to the word of God.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.360]   Now let me hurriedly summarize and recapitulate again, because this history is of so vital
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.840]   importance to us.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.160]   This is the entire message of the Bible.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.680]   Here it is, God makes men, he makes him perfect, he sets him in a place called paradise.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.560]   And there was men in communion with God, listening to the voice of God, who spoke to him, obeying
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.960]   God, and living a life of perfect bliss.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   But alas, he was foolish enough to listen to the other suggestion, which was made to
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.480]   him by the devil, the great antagonist of God.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.560]   And you remember that the form the devil's temptation took was this, was to get men to
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.240]   query and to question the word of God.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.640]   "Hear hath God said," says the devil.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.720]   In other words, he puts up a query about the truth of the word of God, the fairness of
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.560]   it, the love of it, and so on.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.920]   And men in his folly listened to the temptation, to the suggestion, and he rejected the word
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.320]   of God.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.200]   He believed that God was really against him, that he had it in him to be a God himself,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.360]   if he were but given a chance, and he exalted himself and pitied himself and his little
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.880]   puny mind against God, and thereby fell.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.080]   Fell into misery, fell into shame, became the slave of the devil, lost his freedom,
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.280]   and instead of enjoying the fruits of the garden, he begins to have to work and to earn
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.120]   his bread by the sweat of his brow.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.840]   When thorns and thistles appear for the first time, man is aware of conflict and antagonism
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   everywhere.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.060]   There it is, it all happened, you see, at the very beginning, the moment men refused
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.600]   to listen to the word of God.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.480]   And the story is that ever since then, man has remained like this.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.360]   He fell and he's remained full.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.160]   And then, of course, we have the further history which just comes to this, that in spite of
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:38.880]   this unspeakable folly on the part of men, God didn't turn his back upon him.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:48.720]   God came into the garden in the cool of the evening, and man heard the voice of God speaking.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.440]   He was terrified.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.560]   He thought that the pronouncement would undoubtedly be made at once, that he was to be put to
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.080]   death.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.520]   And he went and hid himself, but God called him out.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.720]   And having exposed his sin to him, and having told him that it must be punished and would
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.880]   be punished, God nevertheless added that gracious promise that the seed of the woman should
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.520]   bruise the serpent's head.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.840]   And there you have the beginning of a new history, so that I can summarize it all up
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   by putting it like this.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.240]   From that point onwards, there have been two histories in this world.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.320]   There has been the history of man himself, man in sin.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.040]   And on the other hand, there has been this history that God has been producing, that
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.000]   God has been introducing.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.480]   You see, he starts there at the very beginning by indicating that he has a plan for the salvation
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.800]   of the world, but that it is going to be opposed, it's going to be fought tooth and nail by
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.160]   men in sin.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.680]   There are two seeds, the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, and there is
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.840]   going to be enmity between them.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.800]   God said it at the very beginning.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.120]   Now the Bible is in a sense nothing but the record of the strife and the conflict between
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.760]   these two seeds.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.560]   And we've been following the story.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   We've been following it in order to show this, that in spite of every chance and opportunity
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.460]   that God gave to man, man just would not take it.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.520]   In spite of having brought this ruin upon himself, he didn't learn the lesson.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.960]   He didn't realize the one thing to do was to go back to God, and to be right with God.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.360]   No sin multiplied, and so much so, it became so impossible that God decided to destroy
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.800]   the ancient world in the flood, and did so.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.160]   He saved a remnant, eight people only, and again there's another start for mankind.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.800]   But did man learn the lesson?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   Again he didn't.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.920]   Again he exalted himself, set himself up, wanted to make a great name for himself, built
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.240]   his city, built his tower of Babel, and again God visited him in punishment.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.320]   Now God had been giving men remarkable opportunities all that long time, but man, you see, he
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   wouldn't take it.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.120]   And remember all that history which I've summarized in a few sentences took two thousand
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.760]   years.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:25.440]   And then God began taking very special action.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.640]   He called a man of the name of Abram, and drew him out of his country, out of paganism,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.160]   and brought him into a country of his own choice, the land of Canaan.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.640]   There is the beginning of a new race.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.360]   God now, having given men these opportunities in the way that I've indicated, is now going
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.760]   to do a new thing.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.120]   In the furtherance of this plan of his, of the seed of the woman that's going to bruise
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.280]   the serpent's head, he produces a new nation, a people for himself, through whom he'll be
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.480]   able to speak to the whole world, because he's going to set them apart, he's going
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.280]   to bless them, and so on, the call of Abram, the possibility of the new life, the new race,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.720]   the new people.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.640]   But you remember that we saw that God had found it necessary to give even to this new
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.000]   race a law.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.080]   God spake on Mount Sinai, and the people heard the voice, and they saw the lightning and
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.720]   heard the thunder, the giving of the law, and all the great message of the law of God
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.680]   to men, that they must keep in this right relationship to him.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.480]   They must know exactly what he wants, and they must obey him.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.160]   But again they failed, though they thought they could succeed.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.960]   So God introduced the tabernacle and all its great message and its teaching, telling men
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.040]   how without a sacrifice for sin, communion was impossible, and all that great message
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.480]   there of the ceremonial law, and all that it has to tell us about the absolute need
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.200]   of remission of sins, and that without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:18.840]   And then, we saw the other great thing which God did under that old dispensation was to
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.160]   send his prophets.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.640]   We took a typical illustration in the first of the series called Semuel, last Sunday
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   evening.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.120]   Well now there's your Old Testament, Moses and the prophets, the law and the prophets,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.260]   speaking, addressing the people, bringing the word of God.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.720]   And there was that mighty succession of prophets who came one after another.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.560]   You can read their books in this Old Testament, and they all say the same thing.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.220]   They expose sin.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.160]   They denounce the sin of the people.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.200]   They call the people back to God in repentance.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:00.560]   And they show them that their only hope lies in the action which God is going to take.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:08.520]   But you can't read your Old Testament without feeling and without finding that it all in
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.780]   a sense leaves the situation where it was.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.920]   Look at those children of Israel, in spite of having the law and the oracles of God and
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.560]   their tabernacle and their temple and all these arrangements which God had made for
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.920]   them, in spite of having that mighty succession of preachers speaking to them directly with
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.700]   the voice of God as it were, look at their story, look at their miserable life, look
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:42.660]   at them in sin and shame and degradation and unhappiness, look at the people of God being
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.760]   defeated by other enemies, carried away into captivity into various countries.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.800]   What a wretched story it is.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.840]   But there are the facts.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.200]   What then is the great lesson of the Old Testament?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.520]   Well it is that man in sin is hopeless.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.820]   That though you give him chance after chance and opportunity after opportunity, he makes
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.820]   nothing of it.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.820]   He cannot.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.680]   He's bound, he's fettered.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.640]   As the apostle Paul puts it, even though with his mind he may seem to delight in the law
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   of God, there's another law in his members, dragging him down, rendering him incapable
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.560]   of keeping the law of God.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:39.120]   And so, in spite of all that God did, there I say you see this picture of failure and
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.800]   of misery.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.000]   And yet you know that isn't the only thing you learn as you look at the Old Testament
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.480]   and extract its great message?
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.840]   What you rarely see is this, isn't it?
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.400]   That in spite of the recalcitrance and the failure of men, in spite of all this miserable
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:06.040]   story of men appearing to get better and then lapsing back again into failure, God is still
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:13.720]   there and God is still controlling and God is still overruling.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.040]   You go through the story and you'll see it everywhere.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.760]   These people of God, they get into trouble and you think, well, that's at last the
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.480]   end of the story.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.640]   How often did that seem to happen to them?
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.280]   You would have thought that when they were there in Egypt under the pharaohs that really
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.400]   the end of the story had come.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.580]   How can people make bricks without straw?
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:41.720]   What hope is there for a race and its perpetuation when the very midwives have been given instructions
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.480]   to kill all the males that are born?
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:52.600]   It seems the end, and it would have been the end, were it not that God intervened.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.280]   That's the story, you see, the misery, the wretchedness, the failure of the children
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.560]   of Israel, but God coming down, God breaking in.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.240]   It's everywhere.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.360]   Oh, and it is the most thrilling story in the world.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:17.560]   I see it all epitomized, as it were, and summarized in the story of the royal call of Moses, who
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.640]   had to flee from Egypt, you remember.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.840]   There he is in the land of Midian and he's become a shepherd, a man with all his talent
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:33.440]   and ability, whiling away his time, as it were, as a shepherd and doing it for 40 years,
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:40.300]   a wasted life, you'd think, and probably had given up all hope, had almost forgotten his
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.760]   own people in the land of Egypt, though he may have occasionally thought about them.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.400]   But what can one do?
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   Who is he to stand up against the might of the pharaohs?
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.880]   What can he do at Inuit in this strange land?
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.400]   And there he goes one afternoon to lead his sheep, as we are told, to the backside of
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:03.880]   the mountain, expecting nothing at all, when suddenly he's staggered and amazed and arrested
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:12.400]   by the sight of a burning bush and the voice of God speaking unto him out of the midst
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.720]   of the burning bush and indicating to him the way of deliverance and of salvation.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.960]   God said, "Moses, I am come down.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:28.360]   I have seen the misery of my people and I have come down to rescue them and to redeem
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   them."
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   That's it.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.600]   And it goes on.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.960]   Look at these kings, how hopeless they seem at times.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.920]   God raises them.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.840]   Look at the whole nation, carried away into captivity.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.560]   You say, "Well, very well, that is the end."
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   No, it isn't.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.320]   Though they're in the great power of Babylon, which was second to none at that time and
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.080]   seemed to have everything that a nation could desire, you would have thought that they were
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.040]   absolutely hopeless, but they were not.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:03.680]   God can even overrule and control the mind and the thought of a pagan and a heathen king
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.320]   and potentate, and he can even use him as his instrument, as his servant.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.920]   "I have raised up Cyrus," says the Lord, "and he sends a remnant back to Jerusalem."
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:22.600]   Now, I think you must agree that that is the great story of the Old Testament, the abject
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:29.520]   failure of man in sin, God intervening, the two histories, the history of man, the history
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.120]   of God's salvation.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:39.280]   The old story of the seed of the woman being perpetuated, the nation kept going for God's
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.680]   great end and object and purpose.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.320]   And there you come to the book of the prophet Malachi, which is the last book in the Old
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   Testament, and then there's a sudden stop.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:17:01.320]   And then for four hundred years there doesn't seem to be a single word from God.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.440]   One of the prophets, you know, had prophesied that because of the sin of the people a famine
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   would come.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:15.560]   He says, "Not a famine of bread, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord, a
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.600]   much more terrible thing."
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.840]   And there was such a famine for four hundred long years.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.720]   God seemed to stop speaking.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.480]   No word came at all from Malachi.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:34.080]   Four hundred years, dead silence, God as it were, has ceased to be interested and ceased
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.680]   to be concerned.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.120]   What happened during the four hundred years?
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.760]   Well, it's very fascinating.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.360]   The history of that four hundred years is a very remarkable period in the history of
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.040]   the human race.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.120]   God as it were says nothing.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.320]   God didn't speak in this great and mighty manner.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.000]   He dealt with individuals, of course, and he blessed them, and there were some amazing
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.760]   exploits even among the children of Israel.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.600]   But in the sense of God speaking as he spoke in Eden, as he spoke at the flood, as he spoke
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.620]   at the Tower of Babel, as he spoke to Moses, as he spoke to Abraham, as he spoke to Moses,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.040]   as he spoke in the giving of the law, as he spoke in the tabernacle, as he spoke through
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.480]   his prophets, he stopped doing that.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.040]   Silence for four hundred years.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.880]   But I say some very interesting and important things were happening at the same time.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.920]   And to me they are of the greatest possible importance in considering these matters.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.280]   You know what happened in those four hundred years?
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:57.800]   Well, you have the great story of Greece and the great story of Rome.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.280]   That's what you get at that time when God is silent.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:11.080]   The Greeks, the Greek Empire, Alexander the Great, and all that can be said about Greek
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:17.040]   culture and knowledge and wisdom and understanding, and all that they developed with regard to
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.280]   views of life, the philosophers, the great philosophers, drawing their blueprints of
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:31.040]   a utopia, the message of man to man, to deliver men and to set men up again, all that came
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.560]   at that time.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:42.000]   You know, there's not a word about it in the Bible, and I think, if I may say so with
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.400]   reverence, that that is the most remarkable bit of divine humor of all.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.360]   It's not even mentioned.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:20:00.480]   Paul just makes one fleeting reference to it when he says this, "The world by wisdom
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.000]   knew not God."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.920]   What a way to summarize the whole story of the mighty Greek philosophers and Greek culture.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.440]   But that's it, that's all we've got.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:19.040]   It all came at that time, and then it was followed by all the astounding things that
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.280]   were done by the Romans and the Roman Empire.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.920]   I mustn't stay with this this evening, but you know something about it, don't you?
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:38.080]   Those masters at government and law and planning.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.840]   Well, it all happened during the silent four hundred years.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.280]   And again, you see, the Bible tells us nothing about it.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.840]   Oh, it tells us incidentally that the Romans had conquered Palestine.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.600]   They had conquered almost every country at that time.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.240]   It was the Pax Romana, so-called.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:05.440]   With their mighty prowess, they had laid low every country, and there was a kind of peace.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.520]   A peace because people simply couldn't stand up to the might and the power of the great
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.520]   Roman Empire.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.920]   And, of course, in a sense it had been a time of wonderful development in the respects to
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   which I've referred, namely the law and the government and the planning and the whole
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.480]   ordering of life.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.000]   It all happened at that time.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.680]   But the Bible says nothing about it.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   Why?
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.180]   Well, that's human history.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.040]   And that history, you see, hasn't changed the problem of men at all.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.600]   It just didn't touch it.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.840]   It didn't reduce immorality and vice.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.360]   It didn't put an end to drunkenness and theft and robbery.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.120]   It didn't improve the face of the world and of society.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.920]   It was a complete failure.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.400]   All the descriptions of the failure in the Bible, you'll get them in the first chapter
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.520]   of the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:18.360]   The second half of that first chapter, there it is, in all its foulness and its horror.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:26.080]   The world which had had the incomparable advantage of Greece and Rome at their best and highest
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:34.600]   was guilty of foul perversions and unmentionable sins and horrors.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.840]   That's what happened during the four hundred years.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.400]   That's man's history, you see.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.440]   God, as it were, stood back and said, "All right, you now believe that you really can
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.520]   put your world in order."
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.320]   Of course, you see, looking back to the time before the flood and to the Tower of Babel,
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.280]   man was in his primitive stage then, and he hadn't developed.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.800]   But now, of course, culture has flowered and man's mind has developed.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.400]   And the Romans and the Greeks, they felt they rarely could do it, and they set out to do
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   it.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.280]   And God just stood back and became silent and said nothing, and just allowed them to
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.920]   see what they could do for four hundred long years.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:25.800]   And the result was, as I've just been describing to you, the problem of man remained exactly
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.880]   what it had always been ever since men fell in the Garden of Eden.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.760]   In spite of these unsurpassable efforts on the part of men, the effort of the Greek and
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:49.680]   the Roman, man remained down in misery and wretchedness and sin and shame.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   And then the next step is the one that we are considering this evening.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.240]   In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, there you are, there's your Roman
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.600]   emperor, Pontius Pilate, one of his governors, and all the rest of them, all these little
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.720]   potentates appointed by Rome, some of them allowed on the sufferance of Rome to have
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.560]   a certain amount of pomp and sway.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.960]   Here they are, this horrible list of all of them and what characters these men were.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:32.800]   Well, while these people were in control, the word of God, which hadn't been heard for
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:45.280]   four hundred years, came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:51.240]   The other history, which seems to have stopped, suddenly gets going again, and the most amazing
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.120]   things that have ever happened in the world began to take place.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:02.880]   Well, my dear friends, that is, you know, the whole message of the Bible.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.440]   And if we only understood what that means, there's no need for me to say another word.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.400]   But we don't understand.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.520]   That's the trouble.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   It's because we don't understand that the world is as it is.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:21.480]   It's because we don't hear, because we are deaf, because we are blind, to this very thing,
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:29.840]   that mankind is as it is this evening, and individuals are as they are.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   What's it mean?
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.800]   Well, let me try to summarize it for you.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.640]   It's God's activity.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:47.880]   The word of God came unto John, as it had come, you see, always, in the Garden of Eden,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:56.280]   as it had come to Abram in the hour of the Chaldees, when he least expected it and wasn't
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:03.680]   looking for anything, as it came for the disconsolate, dejected, perhaps even cynical Moses, there
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:11.480]   was a shepherd in the land of Midian, the word of God came.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.320]   It's always that.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:21.160]   It's never men's activity that matters, it's God's activity.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.840]   You see, we've all so gone astray because we've accepted the popular current philosophy
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:33.600]   that man is always searching for God, and that man is thirsting for God, and that man
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.760]   seeks and delves into the mysteries and tries to find out the truth, and at long last he
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:44.760]   shouts his Eureka, he's arrived.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.240]   That's the exact opposite of the message of the Bible.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:58.320]   The first great category in the Bible is what is called revelation, revelation, and revelation
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:05.240]   is the exact opposite of discovery.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   To me, the greatest tragedy has been that so often during this last hundred years that
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:18.760]   men have used this noble, great term revelation and have described it as discovery.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:24.680]   Revelation means that someone draws back a veil and shows you something.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.600]   It isn't that you at last have arrived at something, not at all, it's the exact opposite.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   It's God revealing, unfolding, unveiling.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:45.480]   The word of God came unto John, the son of Zacharias, and you remember his story, don't
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   you?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.200]   He's the last of the great prophets in a sense, he's a prophet and says, "Our Lord,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.400]   more than a prophet, he's the forerunner."
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:28:00.720]   And you remember that even his birth was a miracle.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.400]   It was such a miracle that his own father didn't believe the angel when he told him
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.840]   it was going to happen.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.120]   Go back and read chapters one and two, as well as this third chapter of the gospel according
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.960]   to St. Luke, and you'll find it all.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.080]   Here's a man going into the temple to do his duty.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.720]   They did it by rotor.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:24.040]   They were people drawn up, you remember, and put into certain groups, and they went in
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   in turn.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.920]   They worked on a rotor system.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.880]   And it happened to be the turn of this man, Zacharias.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.280]   And he was now an old man, and his wife was old, and he went in just to do his duty, and
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.160]   suddenly he saw an angel who spoke to him and who addressed him.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   Discovery?
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   Where's the discovery there?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.040]   He wasn't looking for angels.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.520]   He wasn't looking for anything.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.560]   He was just going in to do his job.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   But suddenly an angel appears to him.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:57.720]   That's the opposite of discovery.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.800]   And he told him that his wife was going to bear a child and that they should call his
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.320]   name John.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   And he didn't believe it.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.740]   He said it's impossible.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.160]   And he was punished for his unbelief.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.440]   He was rendered dumb.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.280]   But it did happen, you see, it was a miracle.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   Well, it's God, you see.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   God prepared, God produced the child.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.640]   There would never have been a John but for the action of God supernaturally, miraculously.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   And then having produced him, he sent him there into the wilderness.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.560]   He filled him with his Holy Spirit from his birth, we are told.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.320]   And here is a man who's conscious of a mission and a sense of call.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.640]   He didn't understand it.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.480]   But he was always unlike everybody else.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.600]   He didn't want to live in the towns and do the thing to do and be in the smart set and
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.000]   enjoy the social round.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Not at all.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.040]   He went and lived in a wilderness.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.440]   And he knew that the body, even in a wilderness, can stand between a man and the knowledge
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   of God.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.240]   And so he put on a camel hair shirt and he didn't eat the ordinary food.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.400]   He lived on locusts and wild honey.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   Why?
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.880]   Well, he's got a sense of mission.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.120]   He feels the hand of God is upon him.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.460]   He doesn't know what he's been prepared for, but he knows he's been prepared for something.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.640]   He doesn't want the world.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.420]   He sees it's opposed to God.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.480]   He goes off on his own and he lives there.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:32.240]   The kind of anchorite, a hermit, an isolated person who segregated himself from all humanity
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:37.200]   and society because of this pressure of God upon him.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.560]   And still he doesn't know, but there he is.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.800]   He's being prepared and he knows he's being prepared.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:54.080]   Then suddenly, in the wilderness, the word of God comes to him.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.040]   The other history is still going on.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   God is still revealing himself.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.540]   The promise made in the Garden of Eden has not been forgotten.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.720]   My dear friends, this is our only hope tonight.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   There is no other hope in this world.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:22.320]   I know that many perhaps today are talking about the Christmas spirit.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.080]   Maybe they're appealing to the National Union of Teachers to show a little of the Christian
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.880]   spirit.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.480]   Well I'm glad you smile at it.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.080]   It is to be smiled at.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:41.040]   That's not the business of the Christian church, nor any preacher of the gospel.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.600]   I don't pretend to understand the rights and wrongs of these matters, and it's not my province
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.940]   to criticize teachers or any other workers.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   They know the facts.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.940]   I don't.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.800]   I'm not called to do this.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   What I'm called to do is this, is to say that man is incapable of applying what is called
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.200]   the Christmas spirit.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.760]   Man in sin can't do it.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.380]   The Christian spirit is not something to be applied.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:20.920]   It is something that God puts in a man's soul, and if he doesn't, men will never exercise
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.440]   it.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.600]   That's my message.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.760]   Men I say will talk about the Christmas spirit and its application.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.920]   They will tell everybody to pull together and to be brotherly and friendly, and then
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:40.960]   the new year will come and they'll say, "Now let's make 1956 a red-letter year."
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.520]   They've said it every year throughout the centuries.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.360]   But still we go on in the same old way, and we will go on, because we are in sin, and
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.280]   because we can't do anything else.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.360]   We are captives of the devil.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.560]   We are wrong within.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:10.920]   And the only hope I say is that the word of God comes, and that is the message of Christmas.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:24.000]   Well, let me point out these things, these simple principles, which are very vital.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.520]   Obviously this word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness as a part
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.480]   of God's plan.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.120]   You see, God has got his plan.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.440]   I've told you that that's clear everywhere in the Old Testament.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.680]   You read the Old Testament superficially and you'll say God's plan went all wrong.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   Look at the children of Israel.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.200]   But I say look at the other side.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.560]   Look how God kept them going in spite of their being what they were.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   God's plan.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.200]   Here it is again.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.280]   God has got his plan.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.920]   Nothing ever happens accidentally in this other history.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.240]   Spiritual history is always according to plan.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.680]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.800]   He saw the end from the beginning.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.680]   All this redemption is in the mind of God since before the very foundation of the world.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.280]   The plan of redemption, the scheme of salvation.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.280]   Here it is.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.160]   The point has arrived.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.680]   God's plan.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.400]   Have you seen God's plan running through the Bible?
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.640]   Haven't you seen it as you've looked at the whole history of the world?
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:41.200]   This line of God that runs parallel with the other very often and then breaks into it.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.800]   And you notice the time element, don't you?
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.100]   Perfectly planned, perfectly arranged.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.560]   God knew exactly when he was going to do this.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.160]   God's timetable doesn't vary according to men and what men does.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.240]   Down unto God are all his ways.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.360]   From before the foundation of the world, there is a moment, there is a time when the fullness
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.480]   of the times was come.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   That's it.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.800]   God's exact time.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.960]   Do you remember how God even told Abraham at the very beginning that the children of
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:29.520]   Israel would be down there in the captivity of Egypt for 430 years?
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.320]   It works to the second.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.120]   It never goes wrong.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   It never fails.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.800]   It came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.920]   But - and this is the thing that I rejoice in above everything else as I generally read
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:52.720]   this chapter - the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.400]   In spite of the conditions prevailing.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.040]   Now that is our blessed hope tonight.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.280]   A man once said, reading these first two verses of this third chapter of the gospel according
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:11.600]   to St. Luke, he put all these names on a bit of paper, and this is how he put it.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.560]   I don't say this to amuse you because it's a strictly accurate statement.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:25.760]   He said, "There has never been a greater collection of blaggards ever in the world than those
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.880]   men listed there."
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.960]   You can read their stories and you'll find that that is not an exaggeration.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.840]   It's a collection of blaggards, and they were in control.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:48.160]   It was then that God sent his word to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:54.840]   Oh, my dear friend, the world is black and dark tonight.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.360]   Things are going wrong.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.760]   We all know that.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.320]   The world is unhappy.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   It's in misery.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.160]   It's in wretchedness.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.080]   People are beginning to ask what's going to happen, what lies ahead.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   Here's the answer.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:15.880]   God acts, and he acts in spite of men and in spite of circumstances.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.320]   Your hope is not based upon what's happening in the world.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:26.360]   It must be based upon the God who is above the world and outside, the flux of history,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:32.320]   and who does what he wants to do and carries out his sovereign purpose in spite of men
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.920]   and in spite of sin and in spite of hell.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:44.840]   That's how it comes, and it's coming still.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.560]   And you and I are privileged to listen to it tonight because it's still saying the
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   same things.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   What's its message?
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:57.880]   It's this, that all God's purposes are culminating in this person.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.280]   "When I," says John the Baptist, "well, I'll tell you," he replies.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:12.320]   "I'm in a sense nothing but a voice, the voice of one crying in the wilderness."
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   There he is.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.440]   He'd been preaching and baptizing the people, and he saw a little crowd gathering together
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.960]   and talking to one another, and they said, "You know," they said, "this must be
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   the Christ.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.440]   Did you notice how it's put here?
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:33.240]   And as all men and as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:43.000]   whether he were the Christ, the long-expected Messiah or not, John heard them.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.040]   As they there were about to decide that he was, after all, the coming Messiah, John answered,
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:39:00.320]   saying unto them all, 'I indeed baptize with water, but one mightier than I cometh,
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.200]   the lecher to whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:12.480]   He, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.'
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.400]   It all points to him.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.640]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.220]   He's come.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.560]   Why did God call Abram?
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.320]   Well, it was out of Abram and his loins and the nation that he developed out of him that
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.840]   this Messiah was to come, born of the seed of David after the flesh according to the
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   flesh.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   Of the seed of Abram, he's come out of Israel as regards his human nature.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.520]   That's why God has done all this.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:50.240]   All this past history has been just leading up to this person, God's own Son come in
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.560]   the flesh to be the Redeemer of the world.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.920]   The whole of the Old Testament points to Christ.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.480]   It's looking to him, it's waiting for him.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.640]   You notice some of the magnificent bursts of eloquence of some of the prophets.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   They've seen him.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.080]   'Abram saw my day,' says Christ himself, 'and rejoiced.'
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.800]   And these other men have seen it and they wax eloquent.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.000]   They're lifted up into the heavens as they see him coming.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.560]   Isaiah sees it all in that fortieth chapter where he prophesies the coming of John the
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.000]   Baptist and he says, 'Let a way be prepared for him.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.720]   The Son of God is coming.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:36.920]   The glory of the Lord shall be revealed and every eye shall see this salvation of God.'
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.960]   'Very well,' he says, 'let's prepare a highway for him that is worthy of his royal personage.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:48.560]   Let every valley be exalted and let every hill and mountain be brought low and let every
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.800]   rough place be made smooth and plain.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.480]   Hoy, the Son of God is coming.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:02.280]   The Savior of mankind is about to arrive.'
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:10.400]   And John was given the word and was told to proclaim him and to say that he was only the
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:17.560]   friend of the bridegroom, the forerunner, the herald, the one who has the high privilege
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:25.520]   of running before his Lord and Master.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:33.560]   He must increase as John and I must decrease.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.920]   But that is the message, that is the word, that everything focuses in Christ, that God's
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:45.800]   answer to man's need and man's ill is his own Son, whom he has sent into the world to
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.160]   save, to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:42:00.480]   The Old Testament points to him, the New Testament reveals him, expounds him, shows him, explains
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   him.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   The apostles preach about him.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.000]   They preach Christ, that he is the Son of God.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.760]   They say, 'This is the message.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.960]   There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved.'
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.440]   They are all pointing back to him now.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.760]   He has done everything.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:25.320]   He has finished the work, the Saviour of the world.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.120]   Well how does this help me, says someone?
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:36.600]   Oh, I can tell you, my friend, your troubles are all due to the fact, and mine and everybody
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:43.480]   else's, that we are not in the right relationship to God.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:53.360]   We haven't listened to his word, and now we have lost the power of hearing.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:59.780]   Under the serfs and the dupes of Satan, we can't save ourselves.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.800]   We need to be saved.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.000]   God has sent his only Son into the world to save us.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.280]   Yes, our sin has got to be dealt with, and God has dealt with it.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.960]   Sin is such a terrible thing that God can't pretend he hasn't seen it.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.680]   It's got to be punished, and it has been punished.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:33.080]   In the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   He came.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   Why did he come?
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:41.640]   Well, according to the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, he came to taste death for
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.120]   every man.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:49.200]   Why was the Son of God made a little lower than the angels when he became a man?
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.440]   For the suffering of death.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.240]   The Lord Jesus Christ came not primarily to teach, but to die.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:05.280]   Not to give an example, but to bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:12.880]   dead to sins, should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   Very well.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   That's happened.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.000]   That's taken place.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.080]   I point back to him.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:26.120]   But the message of John the Baptist still applies, and it's this.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.280]   Repent.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.320]   Think again.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.400]   Think again about your life in this world.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   Otherwise I say that it is what it is because of sin, and because you're outside God's blessing,
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.920]   because you're out of relationship with God.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.160]   Think again.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   Think again about God, whom you've so often felt is unfair to you, and you've said in
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.880]   your arrogance and ignorance, "Ah, if God is a God of love, why does this happen to
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.600]   me, and why is this allowed?"
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   Think again.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   Repent.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:12.520]   And change your mind, and look at Christ, and see that God is such a God of love, that
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:18.120]   he sent him into the world, and even to the death of the cross, for you and for your sin.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:27.440]   Think again about God, and having thought, get on your knees, and acknowledge what a
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:36.080]   worm you are, what a foul, pestilential creature you've been in thinking such unworthy thoughts
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.880]   about such a God.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.480]   Repent, acknowledge, and confess your sins.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   Tell him that you see that you deserve nothing from him but punishment, that you have no
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.720]   claim upon his love, that you have nothing to plead at all, that you realize now how
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.200]   wrong you've been.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   Repent.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   Confess your sins.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.120]   Do it thoroughly, says John.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.880]   Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, "We
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.760]   be Abraham's seed."
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.320]   Give up self-defense.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.960]   Give up rationalizing your sins.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.480]   Give up trying to cover your iniquity.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:25.800]   Admit it, confess it all, and fall before him in utter abject surrender.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.000]   Cast yourself upon his mercy.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.960]   Repent, and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.680]   That's the message.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:45.080]   The end of yourself, the beginning of God's salvation in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.160]   And my friends, I would press it upon you.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.000]   I would urge it upon you.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Why?
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.240]   Because you noticed what John said about him.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.640]   "I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the lecher to whose
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.520]   shoes I am not worthy to unloose."
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.920]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.180]   He can give you a new nature.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.720]   He can fill you with the Spirit of God.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   He can lift you up.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   I can't.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.520]   I can simply wash you with water.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   He can do all that.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.520]   He's the Messiah.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   But that isn't the whole truth.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:30.400]   It goes on to say this, "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.480]   floor and gather the wheat into his garment.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:47.160]   But the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:53.760]   The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is not only the Savior, he has also been made
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.120]   the Judge.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.920]   That's what John is saying.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:06.600]   And if we do not repent and believe on him, we shall be judged by him.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:12.360]   I have emphasized this evening again that God has got a plan, that God has got a time,
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.640]   that God has got a purpose, and everything he's promised has come to pass.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.280]   Christmas is proof of that.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.560]   The fullness of the times hath come, and God sent forth his Son.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:30.040]   And when the world crucified him, God allowed him to be buried in a grave.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.880]   But only for the time that he'd indicated, on the morning of the third day, he raised
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.080]   him up again.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.960]   And he's allowing these years to pass.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.000]   But remember, the plan of God is still there.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.360]   And the end of that plan is the coming again of the Son of God into this world to judge
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.200]   the world.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:03.360]   He is going to divide up between the wheat and the chaff.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.080]   He's got a winnowing fend in his hand.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.920]   He'll separate chaff and wheat.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:17.720]   He'll gather the wheat into his garner, the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.920]   And what makes the difference, you see, is whether we have repented and believed or not.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:30.400]   If you repent and believe, you become the wheat that he'll gather into his garner.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:38.280]   But if you don't, you are the chaff that will be burned with unquenchable fire.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:49.200]   Ah, my dear friend, the thought is alarming and terrifying.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:57.520]   But let us simply remember this, that the God who made all those promises in the Old
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:07.320]   Testament and which were literally fulfilled, spoke to John the Baptist in the wilderness,
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:16.080]   and not only told him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Messiah, but that he is
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:25.520]   also appointed as the judge who will judge the world in righteousness at the last assize.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:34.160]   If therefore you believe that God sent his only Son into this world on that first Christmas
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:47.840]   morning, if you want to be logical and consistent, you must also believe that he will come again,
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:54.000]   not as the babe of Bethlehem, but as the King of kings and the Lord of lords, riding on
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:02.600]   the clouds of heaven surrounded by the holy angels, and that he will judge the world finally
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:10.400]   and forever in righteousness.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:22.640]   The word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness, and that is what it was.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.720]   Have you heard it?
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.360]   Have you believed it?
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.960]   Have you acted on it?
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:44.800]   So, be separated to Christ tonight, and thereby escape the wrath which is certainly to come.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.440]   Amen.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
