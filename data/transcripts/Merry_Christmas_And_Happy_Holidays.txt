[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, I just want
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.660]   to wish everyone happy holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and more. It's been obviously
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.540]   a really difficult year with the S&P 500 down about 20 plus percent. The real estate market
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.060]   is starting to fade. Cryptocurrency down 70 plus percent. Scandals and everything. So
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.100]   the bright side, hopefully, is that we've all been able to live life a little bit more.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.900]   I know my wife and I, we've gone out on many more date nights in public. We went to see
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.300]   the Warriors. We went to holiday parties. My parents have flown in. My in-laws have
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.860]   flown in. It's been a better time for friendships and for family. So if we believe friendships
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.260]   and family are more important than money, then hey, maybe net-net 2022 was better than
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.860]   in 2020 and 2021, when we were making a lot of money from our investments, but we had
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.220]   to be separated from our friends and family more often. I'm talking about the subject
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.740]   of friends and family more because I just listened to my last episode with my wife on
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.660]   the loneliness epidemic. And I really thought deeply about how we can be more connected
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.660]   in 2023. And maybe you find a connection with me by listening to this podcast, because I
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.860]   always want to talk about interesting things that affect many of our lives. Every day,
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.340]   something fascinating is going on that'll affect me, you, our children, our friends,
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.660]   and our relatives. And I want to be on that. And so if I can provide you any type of solace
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.780]   during lonely times, or when your friends are busy, or your family is far, far away,
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.820]   I hope I can. And that's one of the reasons why in December, I've tried to record more
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.180]   episodes. Every other day, frankly.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.740]   It's true that finding friends and companionship takes a lot of effort. You know, I'm in this
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.820]   WhatsApp group chat with fellow parents. And it's interesting every week, I say, Hey, I'm
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.300]   going to be at this playground, riding bikes, or, you know, playing on the structures, come
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.900]   on out. And sadly, for weekends in a row, nobody came out. But a couple parents finally
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.620]   did come out the other day. And it was my son's favorite classmates, two girls, interestingly
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.180]   enough. And I think they are in a love triangle where one girl really likes my son, and my
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.700]   son likes her back. But every time they spend a little bit more time together, the other
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.700]   girl gets very jealous. So during our playdate, one girl cried for about five minutes, because
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   my son was playing with the other girl for a little too long. And then 20 minutes later,
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.820]   the other girl started crying because my son started playing with the other girl for a
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.540]   little bit too long. So it's just fascinating to me as a parent and as a middle aged person
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.500]   now, who has gone through all these emotions and loneliness and feelings of love and anxiety,
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.620]   how we have to experience this again, through our children and how we can help them harness
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.580]   their emotions and control their emotions, so they can feel more confident, happier,
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.500]   and more loved. So even though I have a terrible hit rate of only one set of parents showing
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.300]   up after five invites, I'm going to still send out those invites. I'm going to continue
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.340]   to show up. I'm going to continue to reach out to see if anybody wants to build a relationship.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.780]   I'm going to be at the playground anyway. So if you want to come out, great. If not,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.520]   it's okay. This is the type of attitude I hope every listener adopts. Keep showing up,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.640]   no matter with your side hustle, your small business, your work, your children, building
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.900]   friendships and relationships. Keep showing up even when people are not showing up, even
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.180]   when people don't respond or give you the time of day. Because sooner or later, something
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.740]   good is going to happen. This has been my philosophy since 2009 with Financial Samurai.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.220]   I promised I would publish three times a week for 10 years without fail. And what happened?
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.100]   Well, so much has happened. Namely, I haven't had to go back to work. I've been able to
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.340]   find something I love to do. I've been able to write a bestselling book that I never would
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.940]   have had this opportunity. So you just never know. But if you keep on showing up over and
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.800]   over again, something good is going to happen. Trust me on this one. So thanks so much, everyone
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.020]   for listening. And I hope you have a wonderful Christmas, fantastic holidays. I'm going to
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.700]   be doing my year in review post and also the top posts for Financial Samurai in 2022. And
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.660]   I'm going to be thinking deeply about what 2023 brings and how I can help you and my
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.500]   family live better and more meaningful lives for the next year. Thanks so much, everyone
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.060]   for listening. If you've enjoyed any or all of the 43 podcast episodes for 2022, I'd love
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.780]   a positive five star review. I read all of the nice commentary. It really warms my heart
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.580]   and gets me pumped up and motivated to record more. And if you enjoy any specific episode
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.420]   or this entire show, please share it with people you care about, because if you've enjoyed
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.860]   it, I'm sure they will enjoy it too. Thanks so much. Merry Christmas and happy holidays.
