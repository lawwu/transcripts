[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.960]   I'm gonna do something new.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.840]   Why don't we start with a call?
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.400]   We usually start with written questions.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.360]   Let's actually start with a call.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.440]   I saw one I liked from Alex.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.280]   Let's see if we can find that one lurking in there, Jesse.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.200]   - Yep, here we go.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   - Hi, Cal, my name's Alex.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.360]   I listen to your podcast often.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.960]   I've tried to follow your advice
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.680]   and get all of my important information out of my inbox
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.480]   and into some sort of trusted system, task list, et cetera.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.960]   Here's the problem.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.880]   You do that, you make up a task list,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.120]   but there's more granular information
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.900]   that you need for each task
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.120]   than you're gonna put in a task list.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.800]   And where that granular information lives
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.320]   is in the email trails that gave rise to the task.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.820]   So you're going back to the emails anyway,
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.060]   and you're still living out of the inbox half the time
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.480]   to try to figure out what to do.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.360]   What's your advice on this?
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.680]   Really appreciate your help.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.800]   Love your podcast.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.440]   Thank you.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.080]   - Well, Alex, this is where Trello
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.320]   is gonna do a lot of good for you.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520]   So there's three reasons why I like using Trello
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.480]   when it comes to organizing obligation.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.280]   I like that I can have different boards for different roles
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.860]   so that you don't have to context switch
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100]   between different professional and personal roles.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.440]   You can just be looking at obligations
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.360]   that has to do with what you're doing right now
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.680]   during your day.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.120]   Two, I like the categories.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.400]   Categories are everything.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.960]   Things I don't know what to do with,
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.440]   things I'm waiting to hear back on,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.720]   things I'm gonna bring up at the next staff meeting.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.280]   You can have such creative categories.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.920]   It really helps organize this information.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.860]   But the third thing I like about Trello,
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160]   and this is very relevant for your issue,
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.320]   is the cards can hold large amounts of information.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.200]   This is how you get relevant information out of emails
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.540]   and into a more trusted system,
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.440]   is you put them on the virtual back of Trello cards.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.040]   So when you click on a card in Trello,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.860]   you can flip it over,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.420]   and on the back of it, you can add notes.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.040]   And I will just copy and paste emails,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.680]   text of emails out of Gmail
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.960]   right onto the back of a Trello card.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.320]   And if there's a thread of emails that are relevant,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.840]   paste one, put a few horizontal dashes to divide,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.520]   paste another, a few horizontal dashes,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.960]   divide, paste another.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.200]   You don't have to format it nice.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.080]   Don't waste much time.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   Just get it all in there.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.960]   You can attach files to these cards.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040]   So people are passing back and forth drafts
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.960]   of the report that you're working on,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.080]   attach it to the card.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   That's where it lives.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   It lives in Trello.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.120]   You can even put checklist.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.260]   So maybe I'm looking at a thread of emails
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.080]   about a visitor coming, let's say, to campus,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.400]   and I'm in charge of their visit,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.980]   and I've been doing a back and forth with someone
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.120]   about what do I need to do?
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.400]   What do I have to arrange for this visitor?
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.520]   I might extract out of that exchange a list.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.160]   You can do checklist on the back of cards in Trello.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.000]   One, two, three, four, five.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.300]   Or you can actually check things off and see where you are.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.460]   That third benefit of Trello is a huge one.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.000]   Because again, what it allows you to do
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.400]   is that when it comes time to work
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.880]   on a certain role in your life,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.840]   so your role as manager, your role as copywriter, whatever,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.160]   you go to that board,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.200]   and all you are seeing is information related to that board.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.040]   And you see everything you need to do
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.840]   under the categories to capture where it should live
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.200]   into your current scheme of obligations.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.120]   So the zeitgeist there is really clear
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.280]   and instantly graspable.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.400]   And all the information you need
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.760]   for the various things on this board
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.480]   are attached right to those cards.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.180]   No need to load up email,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.640]   no need to see completely unrelated requests,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.840]   no need to induce those cognitively
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.080]   devastating context shifts.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   So that's why I'm a big fan of Trello.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.020]   Other tools can do this well.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.400]   I'm not sponsored by Trello,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.520]   I don't have any skin in the game.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.840]   I met once, I believe, the CEO of the company
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   that bought Trello and expressed my admiration,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.480]   but there's no formal relationship there.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.240]   If you have another tool that does those three things,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.880]   that's fine.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.560]   I mean, you can simulate this in something
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.600]   as simple as a Google Doc.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.720]   I've seen people who do this,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.560]   different docs for different roles,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.640]   different bolded headings for different categories,
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.740]   bullet point tasks below it,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.740]   information just indented and pasted right underneath
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.100]   the corresponding task.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.380]   People certainly do this.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.600]   One group that does this for sure is developers.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.660]   We talked about this in a past episode.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.960]   We were talking about plain text productivity,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.400]   but we mentioned that the original term life hacking
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.580]   came from this idea,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.120]   it was Danny Lewin talking about it,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.140]   that developers would put everything in their life
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.380]   in one big Emacs file,
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.980]   just with indentation and numbers.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.260]   Everything going on, everything they had to do,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.860]   just indent things, have all the information.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.020]   So you can do whatever tool.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.580]   I just think Trello or Trello-like tools make that easy.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.580]   But the key is, Alex, out of your inbox.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.120]   Get the information out of there and into a system
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.960]   that does not force you to have to confront everything else
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.820]   just to work on one particular task.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.300]   (upbeat music)
