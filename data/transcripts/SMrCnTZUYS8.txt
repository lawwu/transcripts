[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620]   Dr. Street is a professor of mine.
[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.880]   Many of you know that I've gone back, I'm getting another master's degree in biblical
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.520]   counseling this time, and Dr. Street's actually the chair of that program out at masters in
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.820]   Los Angeles.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.160]   And he's been a wonderful professor so far, and hopefully this will help me with some
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.560]   coming classes in the coming months.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.140]   Maybe this will give me some brownie points, I don't know if that'll actually work out.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.200]   But he's a professor there, department of the chair, and chair for the graduate programs
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.420]   in biblical counseling at masters university and seminary in Santa Clarita, California.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.700]   In addition to this, his ministry there at TMU, he serves as an elder and lay pastor
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.040]   there at Grace Community Church in Sun Valley.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.480]   He's a second generation pastor, giving more than 40 years to pastoral ministry.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.580]   He planted a church called Clear Creek Chapel in Springboro, Ohio, where he built a strong
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.840]   counseling program there as well, and a training center, and he currently serves as the president
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680]   of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors, ACBC.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.820]   He's married to Janie, who we've gotten to know through correspondence with all the logistics
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.200]   for this conference, for 41 years, and they have four children and six grandchildren.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160]   So many of you are probably able to relate with that.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.640]   Let me say this, he has a lot of things that he does.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.300]   He travels all around the country and teaches, and preaches, and shares in conferences and
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.560]   all around the world.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.240]   But tonight, and tomorrow, and Sunday, he's all ours.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   Amen?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   He's all ours.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.520]   So, brother, why don't you come on up?
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.760]   - It is a great pleasure to be here.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.360]   I've been praying for this for a long time.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.720]   Now, I wanna share with you why it's so important for me to be here, because I still have three
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.280]   grandchildren that are visiting us from New Brunswick, Canada, at our home right now,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.200]   and I left them, all right, to come to be with you.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.360]   So that shows you.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.600]   I didn't realize how good I was at spoiling until I became a grandfather.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.800]   I'm gifted at it, I'm really gifted at it.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.160]   And I know some of you are wondering, "What is a guy that looks 25 years of age doing
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.080]   with six grandchildren?"
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.800]   But we do have six grandchildren, three of them are out there with my wife, and that's
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.780]   the reason why my wife's not here.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.360]   She would normally be here, but she's bidding farewell to those three kids and our daughter
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.440]   as they go back to Canada.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.340]   That's where they live and serve, and serve in a great church there as well.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.160]   It's a pleasure to be here at First Baptist, and I know there are a lot of other churches
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.800]   that are represented here, and so hopefully I'll get a chance to meet some of you and
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.040]   welcome you as well.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.920]   All right, in order to get all of our sessions started, let's begin with a word of prayer
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.480]   and then we're going to jump right in, okay?
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.440]   Gracious Father, we would be remiss if we did not ask the Holy Spirit to work in our
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.100]   lives tonight, and tomorrow, and Sunday.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.320]   We can explain what the Word of God says very carefully and clearly, but it really is up
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.860]   to the work and the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit to work in people's lives to transform
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.060]   them.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.500]   And I would pray, dear Lord, I don't care how good a marriage is or how difficult it
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.100]   is, that the marriages will be changed for the better as a result of this weekend.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.620]   We're going to go to your Word.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.240]   It is inspired, it is authoritative, it is superior to anything that man has to offer,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.540]   and it is all-sufficient because it reflects the very character of its author, and that
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.860]   is an all-sufficient God.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.940]   And I pray, Father, that as we look into the Word of God and the authority it has in our
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.140]   lives, that it will transform us and transform our marriages in order to be the type that
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.120]   would be honoring and pleasing to you.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.580]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.100]   If you have your Bible with you, if it's electronic version or a dead tree version, which is paper,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.380]   all right, take your copy of the Word of God, and we want to go over to Romans chapter 12
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.720]   to begin with, and I want to nail down a theme verse for this entire weekend.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.740]   This is something I want you to think about.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.460]   Because when this weekend is over and somebody says to you, "Hey, what'd you do this weekend?"
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.740]   You can say, "You know, I went to a marriage conference."
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.900]   "Oh, you did?
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.980]   Well, what happened there?"
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.920]   "Well, I want you to be able to say that at that marriage conference, I learned how
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.780]   to hate more."
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.940]   I want you to be able to say that.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:55.300]   Romans chapter 12 verse 9, "Let love be genuine, abhor or hate what is evil, hold fast to what
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   is good."
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.780]   "I went to a marriage conference this weekend, and I learned how to hate more."
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.060]   I'm absolutely convinced that in the day and age in which we live, we talk so much about
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.620]   love, we don't talk enough about hate.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.460]   We've got to learn to hate evil.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.820]   And at the conclusion of this weekend, I want you to be able to look back upon everything
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:28.340]   that we've learned and say, "I've learned to hate those aspects of my life that are
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.900]   evil, that are sinful.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.780]   The wrong attitudes I have, the wrong reactions I have, the wrong words that come out of my
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.220]   mouth, I've learned to hate those things because I want to cling to that which is good.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.020]   I want to love that which is good because I know that this pleases my Lord in heaven."
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.580]   And that's going to be our theme throughout the weekend.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.100]   So when somebody says to you, "What did you do this weekend?
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.420]   I went to a marriage conference, and I learned how to hate more.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.820]   I learned how to hate my own sin more.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.220]   That's what I learned to do this weekend."
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.900]   We don't do that enough.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.400]   We coddle our sin.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.940]   We feed our sin.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.940]   No wonder we get into trouble when that happens.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.820]   No wonder there's so much conflict that goes on in marriages because we've allowed these
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.460]   things to preexist for a long, long time.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.600]   Now, in order to set the foundation for everything that we want to do, this session tonight,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.860]   we want to talk about God's design for marriage so that we're all on the same page.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.140]   God's design for marriage.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.460]   This is very important.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.020]   Why do I say that it's important?
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.860]   Well, because there are a lot of different perspectives out there in the world as to
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.260]   what marriage is supposed to be.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:57.280]   And you begin to realize that there are a lot of marriages that are in trouble.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.260]   Maybe you don't know it because they put on a good show on Sunday or around other people,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.580]   but those marriages are nevertheless in trouble.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.140]   I've been counseling marriages for over 45 years now.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.860]   I understand this.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.100]   I've sat across the table from dozens upon dozens upon dozens of marriages that were
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:26.660]   in struggling, having difficulties, conflicts, seemingly conflicts that people would think
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.740]   could never be resolved, and yet God brings about a wonderful transformation in those
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.740]   marriages.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.500]   You can do the same thing in your marriage.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.060]   Well, what is the origin of problems in marriage?
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.020]   Well, some of the origin is that many people marry for the wrong reason.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.740]   They marry for the wrong reason.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.220]   Some people marry because of promiscuity.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.740]   They've been promiscuous prior to getting married, and they feel guilty over that, and
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.420]   they feel that this is what they've got to do.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.300]   They need to get married in order to take care of their guilt.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.200]   Really that's a very poor reason to get married, and in fact, just because you have a little
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.380]   piece of paper that says that you're married doesn't mean that you now have the self-discipline
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.860]   in order to maintain that particular marriage because you didn't have the self-discipline
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.140]   prior to that to maintain your own purity.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.660]   Now you don't have the self-discipline, and you're going into marriage.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.700]   Now we're in trouble.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.740]   So some people marry because they've been promiscuous.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.040]   Other people marry in order to compensate for faults.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.820]   Sometimes they marry in order to run from perceived faults, faults that they think that
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.860]   are a part of their life.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:47.100]   Some people marry because they don't have a lot of money.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.420]   Now you ever heard that saying that says if you marry for money, you end up earning every
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.900]   penny of it?
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.420]   You do.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.900]   And so some people get married.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.660]   They kind of grew up in sort of a poverty situation.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.580]   They marry somebody that has a little bit of money in order to compensate for that.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.280]   That's why they get married.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.580]   Other people marry in order to, well, they've been kind of shy, retiring all of their life,
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.900]   and they marry somebody gregarious.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   They marry somebody really outgoing.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.900]   Life of the party.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.540]   I've always wanted to be around somebody that was like that.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.220]   Life of the party.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220]   Exciting to be around.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.580]   And two or three years into marriage, they're sitting there and they're looking at that
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.460]   life of the party person, and they're saying, "Is that person ever going to sit down and
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.140]   have a serious moment at all?"
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:43.220]   And that person who married that shy, retiring spouse looks at them and says, "Are they ever
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.180]   going to get out and do anything at all?
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.100]   They're just going to sit there and read about life?
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.880]   Is that all they're going to do?"
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.820]   We notice that the people in marriage have not changed, but our perception of them have
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.180]   changed.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:05.900]   That is, the things that drew us originally to our partners prior to marriage becomes
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.260]   their greatest weakness after marriage.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.980]   They haven't changed, but our perception of them have changed.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.900]   How we view them have changed.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.660]   Initially, that was very attractive.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.740]   Now it's not attractive at all.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:28.700]   In fact, it's turned into something that's repulsive.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.180]   So some people marry in order to compensate for faults, in order to run from them.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.380]   Other people marry in order to realize an image.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.340]   They've always dreamed, and I think, gentlemen, the ladies are way out in front of us here.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.820]   By the age of six, they have their marriage planned, their wedding planned, all right?
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.980]   They know exactly what kind of dress they're going to wear.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.880]   They know exactly who's going to stand up with them.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.500]   They know exactly what the colors are going to be, and guys don't even think about that
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.660]   until maybe 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.100]   "Oh, yeah, I may get married someday."
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.620]   But in order to realize an image.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.340]   I've always wanted to be married with a little white house, with a white picket fence, and
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.740]   the children playing so happily out front.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.460]   I've always wanted to be like that.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:23.380]   So we get married in order to realize that image, and that dream now turns into a horrid
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.380]   nightmare.
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.820]   So there are some people who marry to realize an image.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.620]   And then there are other people marry because it's a way to legitimize sex.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.540]   Now, I think the guys are way out in front of the gals on this one.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.980]   "I don't have to feel guilty anymore.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:45.200]   We can do this all the time, and God says it's okay.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.260]   This is all right."
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.900]   Well, they find out it just doesn't work out that way.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.180]   There's some people that get married in order to do that.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.900]   Now, that's not an exhaustive list, and really when you think about it, it's really not marriage
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.540]   that's in trouble.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.660]   It's really the people who are in marriage that's in trouble.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.220]   Marriage is doing just fine.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.900]   It's the people that are in it that has the problem.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.620]   There's been a failure to apply biblical principles in order to build a good marriage once married,
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.060]   and one of the things that I want to do if I don't get anything else accomplished this
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:31.460]   weekend is communicate to you the central, very clear biblical principles on what is
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.900]   it that God expects in order to have a good marriage.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:43.340]   And maybe find out that that's not the way that your marriage is really functioning,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:52.580]   and this is where you have to turn all of your hate upon your sinful attitudes and actions
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.300]   in order for there to be real change.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:05.380]   You've got to love that which is good, that is what God says is right for marriage.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:11.260]   So there are a lot of people who marry for the wrong reason, and we live in a culture
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:17.220]   and society today that is constantly attacking marriage.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.200]   There are several ways, and this is not an exhaustive list either.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.300]   For example, the whole playboy philosophy actually turns people into sex objects.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:32.060]   So that whole philosophy is attack upon God's institution of marriage.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.600]   Gay and lesbian agendas are attack upon God's institution of marriage.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.660]   God never intended any of that to be a part of this world.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:47.500]   It is a very sinful, ungodly thing that undermines marriage today.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:54.220]   You've got entertainment mediums, TV sitcoms, Internet, movies, radio, almost any time you
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.500]   hear marriage mentioned, it's mentioned in a negative way or it's mentioned in such a
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:06.540]   way that it doesn't resemble anything that God has communicated from the Bible, and even
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.620]   in some television sitcoms where you have a man and wife who are happily married, usually
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:19.700]   all the roles are really messed up and it's certainly not depicted the way that Scripture
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.100]   says it should be.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:28.660]   Materialism, the whole focus on things, buying things.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.500]   I need to have a house, I need to have a cabin, I need to have a boat, I've got to have this
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:44.100]   and that and whatever basically elevates things above people, the whole societal emphasis
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:51.060]   upon materialism says things are more important than people, and I'm going to acquire as many
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.580]   things to myself as I can.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.420]   So materialism becomes an attack upon what God intended marriage to be, and then you've
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:06.040]   got all kinds of societal substitutes for marriage, like trial marriages, contract marriages,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:12.860]   live-in lovers, people semi-married, prenuptial agreements, lat marriages, all of these are
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:19.100]   reconfiguring what God intended marriage to be.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.100]   There's trial marriages.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:25.020]   In other words, a lot of sociologists and psychologists are proposing that nationally
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.620]   we propose that people no longer get married for a lifetime, that should never be a part
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.980]   of their vows, they get married for a trial period of time, then at the end of that trial
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.740]   period of time, maybe two to five years, then the contract in that marriage ends and they
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.060]   decide whether or not they want to re-up the contract again.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:50.180]   So let's re-up the contract at the end of that particular period of time.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.700]   So similarly, contract marriages may go a little bit longer, maybe we'll get married
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.540]   for 10 to 20 years, raise kids, and then the contract ends, our marriage is automatically
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:05.140]   over according to law courts, and the kids are already raised, they're out of the house,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:11.580]   they're off to college, we can choose to re-up that particular contract if we want.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:20.060]   We have live-in lovers, people who are semi-married, prenuptial agreements is just an easy way
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:26.060]   to get out of marriage if things go sour, there shouldn't be any easy ways to get out
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:32.060]   of it, and prenuptial agreements basically elevates things above people anyhow.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.740]   Now things are much more important than you are, so I want to maintain my things if we
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.260]   were ever in this marriage.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:47.740]   And then you've got lat marriages, this is really popular in San Francisco, where people
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:53.020]   are living apart together, they have two separate homes, once in a while they go to each other's
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:58.620]   home and spend the night with each other, but they have two separate lives, and on paper
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:04.580]   and legally they're married, and they get all kinds of tax benefits from that, but these
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:12.780]   are lat marriages where they live in two separate locations, and yet occasionally share sex
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.180]   together, but that's it, that's it, that's all there is.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:23.580]   Well, God never intended marriage to be anything like that, not even anything close to that,
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.540]   and so what has all this done?
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:31.140]   People marry for the wrong reason, the family is under attack in our society, almost everywhere
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:36.980]   you go, and the consequence is there's really a two-fold effect here, one is that a lot
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:42.660]   of young people today who want to get married are very unsure about marriage.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.740]   I live in a university and college environment, I see this all the time, and most of the young
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:56.180]   men and women at the Master's University are very committed Christians, but you can see
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.980]   it in their eyes, here we head up part of the graduate department in counseling, so
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.380]   we got couples walking in all the time, "Hey, we just got engaged, do you do premarital
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.300]   counseling here?"
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.940]   All of these things, you can see that far off look in their eyes, are we going to become
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.780]   one of those statistics?
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:22.140]   We've heard about those statistics, and probably one or two of them, both of them, come out
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:28.540]   of homes that mom and dad divorced maybe several years before.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.940]   They're afraid they're going to do that, but the other effect probably affects you as well.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.340]   All that's going on here, a lot of people who are already married have lost hope.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:45.940]   "We just got to stick it out until we die, so on our tombstone they'll say, 'They made
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.940]   it!
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.300]   They didn't divorce!'"
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.620]   Is that exactly what God intended?
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.780]   That's not at all what God intended.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:07.660]   Just to make it, just to make it through life, that is so shallow, and that's where we have
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.820]   a lot of marriages today that are 20 miles wide and a half inch deep.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.580]   That's not at all what God intended, and this is why I love ministering in the day and age
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.460]   in which we live.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.220]   I think our day and age resembles the church, society, and culture of the first century
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.060]   more and more as time goes on.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:34.380]   The church is growing up in the first century in a very hostile culture and environment.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.700]   We're growing up now more and more in a very hostile culture and environment.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.180]   I mean, I love ministry in this kind of environment.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.180]   Why?
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.780]   Because the church of Jesus Christ has lasting answers, and we've got to get busy proclaiming
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   them.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:56.940]   He has lasting answers, and we've got to get busy proclaiming them.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.940]   Now are you ready?
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.940]   Here we go.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.940]   That's just my introduction.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.940]   Okay?
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.580]   Here we go.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.700]   So fasten your seatbelts and put your crash helmets on.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.860]   Alright, what do we mean by all of this?
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:17.360]   Well, the first observation I want to make here is all the contemporary presuppositions
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.060]   in contrast to what God has designed out there, and when I say contemporary presuppositions,
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:35.500]   I'm talking about the way society views marriage today, the average American, the average person
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:43.860]   in Europe, in Latin America, the way they view marriage today is radically different
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:50.320]   than the way God intended marriage to be reviewed.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.860]   There are a lot of secular theories out there, and most of these views and presuppositions
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.980]   go back to these particular secular theories that marriage really is a result of man's
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.580]   planning and design.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:10.020]   That man was the one who actually invented marriage.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:16.740]   And I have to read, try to keep up with all the secular stuff that's out there in the
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.240]   area of sociology and psychology, and all the graduate level material that's produced
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.660]   out there, reading all of this material, and the theory goes something like this.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:35.220]   It's sort of an evolutionary caveman type of arrangement, that's how marriage got started.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:43.460]   There were two guys in prehistoric times, we'll call one Bog and the other one Zog.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.820]   Bog and Zog were two guys in prehistoric time.
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:22:00.860]   And one day, Bog ran into Zog, and Bog said, "Can't tell your woman from my woman."
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:09.900]   Zog said, "You're right, can't tell what we do."
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.340]   Bog says, "I know.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:29.860]   You take your woman to nearby cave, her children will follow her, and you can have a family."
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.620]   Zog said, "Oh, sounds good.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.620]   What's family?"
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:47.700]   Bog, thanks for a little bit, says, "A family where two people agree to live together, maybe
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.940]   we call it marriage."
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:55.900]   Zog says, "Oh, marriage, like that term, marriage."
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:02.820]   So Zog goes over, grabs nearby woman by hair, drags her to nearby cave, all of her children
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.140]   follow her, and now we have marriage.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.820]   You'd say, "That is so stupid."
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:15.380]   But that is exactly, I mean, if you were to boil down all the complicated theories that
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.100]   are out there, and I read them, you boil them down, it boils down to that.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.660]   That it was an arrangement that made society function a little bit better, especially in
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.200]   hunter-gatherer societies, but we live in a sophisticated world.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.140]   We really don't need the institution of family and marriage.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.140]   Most of the responsibilities of institution of family and marriage have been taken up
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:43.380]   by other groups and other society, I mean, they've sort of been institutionalized by
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.060]   governments and so on.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.300]   The family's supposed to protect you, well, we have police forces to protect you.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:56.980]   The family's supposed to provide good health for you, well, we have health institutions
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.940]   that provide good health for you.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.200]   You really don't need these things anymore.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.620]   These archaic arrangements where two people are getting married together and they have
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.980]   to vow a whole lifetime of agreement.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:20.020]   So the implication is we don't accept that, and all of society, the United Nations, when
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.260]   you read their material on family, it doesn't have anything to do with what the Bible talks
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.380]   about in terms of family, just the opposite.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.100]   It's any two people living under the same roof for a particular period of time, so two
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.940]   hobos in a boxcar could be called family, all right?
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.660]   It doesn't matter.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.860]   Whoever they are, whatever the arrangement, whatever society says is okay, that's exactly
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.780]   what marriage and family is.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.700]   Now, we live and we work in this kind of a culture.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:56.220]   This is the very thing that has undermined what we think about marriage and is a cancer
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.520]   in relationship to our own individual marriages.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.900]   Why do I say that?
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:08.620]   Well, because if man developed marriage, then man can redefine marriage anytime he wants.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.940]   If man was the one who invented it, then he can destroy the concept of marriage anytime
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   he wants.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:22.900]   If he's the one who did it, then he has the full right to be able to redefine marriage
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.780]   any way he wishes.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.080]   Wow.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:35.580]   So there we have, that's exactly what's going on in culture today.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:43.300]   But I want you to know that man did not invent marriage.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.140]   Bog and zog are both myths.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:52.020]   They're myths that come out of some kind of sociologist's idea of what marriage is supposed
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.460]   to be.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:00.180]   The Bible says that God was the one who invented marriage.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.820]   He's the one who invented it.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.820]   Take your Bible now.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.940]   Let's go back to Genesis chapter 1.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.980]   We pick up in verse 26.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.780]   Now, follow this carefully.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:17.340]   Genesis 1 and verse 26, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.140]   let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.300]   over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.380]   on the earth.'
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:33.900]   So God created man in his own image, in the image of God, he created him, male and female,
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   he created them."
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:43.500]   Now, I want you to notice something in verse 26, that there is a play here on singular
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.860]   and plural in this verse.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.020]   There's a play on singular and plural.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:58.540]   "Let us," verse 26, plural, "make man," singular, "in our," plural, "image," singular, "after
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:05.120]   our," plural, "likeness," singular, "and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.620]   and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.980]   every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.780]   Now, I want you to notice that there is a very significant play on singular, plural,
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.660]   singular, plural, singular, plural.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:23.060]   In other words, when it says, when God says, "Let us," this is the first time God is referred
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.700]   to in relationship to plurality.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.660]   But in this particular case, what does that mean?
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.820]   Most theologians believe this is probably the first reference to the Trinity.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.300]   We know in chapter 1 and verse 1, it talks about God and then it talks about the Spirit
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.780]   of God moving.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:45.660]   So there are two parts of the Trinity that are actually given to us here in Genesis chapter
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.660]   1, "Let us."
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:52.620]   Now, it's not referring to the angels because the angels did not create, only God created.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.920]   So it's not the angels, "Let us."
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.500]   So it's a reference to God and the plurality of God.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:04.620]   So there is a sense where God says, "Let us," in plurality, "make man," singularly, "in
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:12.300]   our," plural, "image," singular, "in our," plural, "likeness," singular.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   Now you get the idea.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:19.500]   Now, I read a THM thesis on the Hebrew terminology behind likeness and image.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500]   That's really interesting.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   I'll boil it down.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.660]   So it went on for 250 pages, so I'm not going to present all that to you, but I'll boil
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.660]   it down for you.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.660]   It's something like this.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.640]   The guy who did it did a great job.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.100]   He traced the Hebrew term back to Chaldean roots, and in the Chaldean roots of those
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:42.460]   words "image" and "likeness," the idea is this, that back during the earlier times around
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:48.660]   Abraham, they had terms like this, "image" and "likeness," that referred to obelisks.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.020]   Now, we don't know usually what these obelisks are, but in ancient times, they were vitally
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.820]   important because most people didn't read and write.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.780]   So when a king went into a territory and he conquered a territory, he would set up an
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.780]   obelisk of himself there, and it was usually at the crossroads of the territory, so that
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:12.660]   everybody going through that territory would look at that obelisk and say, "That king rules
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.660]   here."
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   All right?
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.140]   Usually made out of stone or wood or whatever the case may be, and the implication here
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.740]   is that that king rules over this area.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:29.580]   We know that because most people, only scribes, read or would write in those days.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:35.260]   The average person did not do that, so they function on the basis of those images.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:43.660]   Well, God picks up these terms, translates them into Hebrew, and now God says this, "I'm
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:52.580]   going to make man in our image, in our likeness," and notice this, immediately as soon as he
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:58.100]   says this, he says, "Let them have dominion," right?
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:07.900]   So God creates man, places him in time and space on this little blue planet out in the
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:16.500]   middle of the universe so that all the hosts of heaven will know that he rules here.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.540]   He's the one who rules, because vitally connected, the image and likeness is the concept of dominion.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.780]   Dominionship, all right?
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:34.140]   Vitally connected to image and likeness is the idea of dominionship and rule is the concept.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.980]   This is really critical, especially when you consider the fact if Satan is alive and well,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:45.660]   and certainly is in our world today, if he can destroy the concept of marriage in our
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:54.260]   society and culture today, then he has taken a mighty blow in the minds of everybody that's
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.540]   alive on earth after who God is.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.860]   Look at verse 27.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:05.620]   He says, "So God created him in his own image," now it's singular, "in the image of God he
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:13.380]   created them," now it talks about the plurality, "with gender distinctiveness, he creates them
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.740]   male and female, he created them."
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.860]   Now here, this is really key, this is what God has done, and the point that I'm trying
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:28.580]   to make is if God created marriage, then he has answers for marriage when it gets into
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:35.940]   trouble, which really means there's hope for your marriage.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:41.300]   If God created marriage, then he has answers for marriage when it gets into trouble, which
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.540]   means there is hope for your marriage.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:54.500]   If you're interested in doing things his way, things can begin to change immediately.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.640]   This is really important.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.300]   The marriage is given by God, and if God gave marriage, and he certainly did, that means
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.260]   he's got answers for marriage when it gets at its lowest point, when it really gets into
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.180]   trouble, he's got the answers for it.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.500]   That tells me several things.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:22.140]   Then based upon Genesis 1:27, as well as Genesis 1:31, that celibacy was never intended to
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:28.980]   be the norm, it's not somehow more holy to be celibate.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.300]   That's sold to us by Roman Catholicism, but that is not biblical Christianity.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.700]   You're not more holy by being celibate.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.980]   That's not anything even close to that.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.740]   God never intended that at all.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.360]   It also tells me that marriage is not to be disparaged.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:54.180]   That actually is a very holy, and it's an honorable state, and that sex and procreation
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:59.980]   is a part of marriage, that means that gender distinctiveness now is called, notice this
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:05.700]   in verse 31, not just good, but very good.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.900]   Now that's very significant because when you read through Genesis 1 at the end of each
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:15.660]   day where God creates literally the universe and everything we know around us, at the end
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.740]   of each day He calls it good, He calls it good, He calls it good, He calls it good,
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:25.460]   He calls it good, and He gets to the sixth day, and what does He say?
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.340]   No, He says it's not good.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.000]   It's not good.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.380]   It's not good for man to be alone.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.340]   I will make a helper suitable for him.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.100]   I caught you, I know.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.140]   Genesis 2.18, it's not good.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.040]   It's the first time that God ever said anything was not good.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.020]   It's not good that man be alone.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.380]   I will make a helper suitable for him.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.340]   God creates Eve, then what does God say?
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.900]   It's very good.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.700]   You're scared to answer now, I know.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.620]   Now it's very good.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.780]   Eve now, listen to this, is the crowning point of creation.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.780]   How about that?
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.780]   Oh, man.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.780]   I got...
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.780]   There you go.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.620]   Listen to that, husbands.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.200]   She's the crowning point.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.380]   God doesn't say very good until she's created.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.000]   She's created for Him.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.900]   That's the idea.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.180]   So this is really key.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.220]   So going back to verse 31 again, "And God saw everything that He had made, and behold,
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.140]   it was very good.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.000]   And there was evening, and there was morning the sixth day."
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.940]   My good German friends would say, "Gut."
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.100]   That's exactly right.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.820]   This is very good, what God has done.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.620]   And He doesn't say that until marriage has been established.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:56.380]   Well, this tells me, furthermore, that marriage is not to compete with human options or human
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.180]   substitutes.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.020]   God never intended marriage to compete with all kinds of substitutes.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.740]   I think one of the biggest things, one of the biggest challenges of the Christian church
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.300]   is right around the corner.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.820]   In the 2020s, we're not far away from it, there are companies all over the world that
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:20.680]   are making these, are in the process of developing these, and this is going to be the biggest
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.060]   attack on marriage that we've ever seen, ever.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.980]   It's right around the corner, and your kids are going to face it more than you have.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:37.380]   And that is, they are developing full, lifelike, robotic companions of the opposite sex.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.220]   You can get anything that you want, any style you want, and guess what?
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.900]   They're never going to grow old.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.060]   They're never going to have bad breath.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.300]   They're never going to argue with you, unless you plan for them to argue with you.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:58.480]   They're always going to do everything that you want, the perfect companion forever.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:09.300]   Is that going to, and they will be so humanly lifelike, that it'll be hard to tell whether
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.660]   or not they're a real person or not.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:22.380]   They are that close, they're that close, but you will never, ever be able to be a true
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.060]   companion with a robot.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:39.700]   There's going to be a sense of getting something that we want in order to serve our lusts,
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:48.140]   but there's going to be a total lack of what God has intended in terms of companionship,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.060]   and you'll see a little bit later why I'm saying that.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.940]   Right around the corner, this is going to happen.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.420]   Not far.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:00.300]   We're training all the guys at the Master Seminary to go out and pastor churches with
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.780]   that kind of threat in mind.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.820]   That's around the corner.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.660]   Those guys will have to, "I'll be dead in heaven, enjoying myself there," and they're
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.700]   going to have to deal with that, all right, in their ministries.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.300]   They're going to be sitting and people are going to be coming to their church and their
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:23.400]   robotic companions will be sitting right next to them.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:29.220]   This is going to be a big attack upon God's institution of marriage.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.340]   It's not far off.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:37.500]   Marriage is not, never intended to compete with human options, human substitutes.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.900]   Marriage is to be a picture of Christ's relationship to His bride, the church, and it teaches an
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.680]   important spiritual reality about God's relationship with His people.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:53.540]   This is the way God describes it back in the Old Testament, with the Old Testament Jewish,
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.860]   with the Israelites, with the New Testament church, God was the husband, Israel was supposed
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.380]   to be the bride.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:06.180]   In the New Testament, Christ is the groom and the church is supposed to be His bride.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:12.340]   If Satan can destroy that image in destroying marriages that we have today, then people
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:17.300]   will have no concept of really what that means in the future.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   No concept of what God ever intended, and so you get this idea that there is a huge
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:34.020]   attack upon marriage today and it's going to get worse, it's not going to get any better.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.300]   What's the original purpose of marriage?
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:45.380]   Well, the original purpose of marriage was not to have children.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:50.780]   That was something actually invented in the Middle Ages by the Pope and Roman Catholicism
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:39:01.860]   and it was because so many of the Roman Catholic boys were dying in the Crusades in order to
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.060]   get more children.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.980]   Genesis chapter 1 verse 28 says, "And God blessed them and God said to them, 'Be fruitful
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.380]   and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish in the
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.460]   sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.460]   earth.'"
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.300]   Now you understand here at this particular point, the "be fruitful and multiply" was
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.720]   a blessing.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.500]   That was a blessing.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   But what was the real purpose behind marriage?
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.780]   What was the real purpose?
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.100]   Well, in order to understand that, you've got to go to Genesis 2:18.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:41.820]   The blessing of marriage was children, but the purpose of marriage, Genesis 2:18, "Then
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:47.820]   the Lord God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.660]   I will make a helper fit for him or suitable for him.'"
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:59.580]   In fact, the Hebrew terminology that's used there is the term, "I will make an ezer konigno
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.580]   for him."
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.660]   I used to call my wife my little ezer konigno.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:11.340]   People thought I was saying evil things about her, but I wasn't.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:20.500]   It was a term of endearment, ezer konigno, a fitting and suitable helper, one ideally
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.420]   suited for him was the idea.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.180]   An ezer konigno is the idea.
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.900]   God's purpose in this was companionship.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.220]   It was not good that man was alone.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:39.420]   And by the way, man is headed right back to that particular point, being alone.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:45.900]   Even though robotic partners are around the corner, man will be increasingly alone, increasingly
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.020]   alone.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:55.460]   Man was alone, that was not good, companionship now becomes the main purpose of marriage.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.060]   This is the way in which God designed marriage.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:04.420]   And it's interesting that that is exactly the thing that goes out the window when marriage
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.480]   starts to get into trouble.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.580]   When there's division between a husband and a wife in a marital relationship, it's the
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.220]   companionship that goes out the window first.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:20.020]   You don't feel like you're a companion to them, you're upset at them, you're angry at
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.700]   them.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:32.300]   Well, we can see this in verses 19 through 21, so let's read down through here.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:37.860]   Genesis 2, let's start in verse 18 and we'll read down through verse 21.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.700]   "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone.'"
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.700]   Now follow this.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.120]   "And I will make him a helper suitable for him.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.780]   Now out of the ground, the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.060]   the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.580]   And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.140]   And the man gave names to all the livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.780]   beast of the field.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:11.860]   But for Adam, there was not found an Acer Canigno for him, a fitting helper.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.480]   So the Lord God caused deep sleep to fall upon man, and while he slept, he took one
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.300]   of the ribs and clothed up its place with flesh.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:26.740]   And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man, he made into a woman and brought
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.940]   her to the man.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:35.260]   So Adam went to sleep single, woke up married."
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.460]   That's what happened to Adam.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:45.780]   Now, why does he give us all this detail about these chronological events where he talks
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:55.280]   in verse 18 that there is no suitable helper for Adam at this point, and then Adam now
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:04.300]   is told to name all the beasts of the field and every bird of the heavens and whatever
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.420]   man called every living creature, that was its name?
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:13.960]   That's very significant, which shows you the extreme intelligence of Adam.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:20.820]   Because Adam, without any recording devices or anything, and God brings him all the animals
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.940]   on earth, and he's able to name every one of them and remember every single one of their
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:31.020]   names, and if he named them on the basis of the typical Semitic way in which a Semitic
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:36.060]   mind would work, he would name the animals on the basis of their most prominent characteristics.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:41.900]   So Mr. and Mrs. Elephant would be long-nosed gray creatures, and Mr. and Mrs. Skunk would
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.380]   be black and white stinky creatures, and so on and so on and so on.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:53.660]   The most prominent characteristics of those animals now would become that was its name.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.180]   So he names all the animals on the planet.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:03.980]   He has nothing to record them, so this is super, super intelligence to be able to do
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.340]   this.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.340]   All the various kinds of animals that are there.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:14.940]   This is an enormous task, and he's able to do this in one 24-hour period of time.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.340]   He's able to do this that quickly.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:24.100]   But you notice this, verse 20 says, "He gave names to all the livestock and to the birds
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:29.340]   of the heavens, to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a suitable
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.460]   helper for him."
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.940]   Now why is that?
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:39.300]   Sandwiched between the end of verse 20 and the end of verse 18 is this naming the animals.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.340]   Why is this sandwiched in between?
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:49.360]   Because, listen carefully, because God wanted Adam to understand that even though the world
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:55.940]   was full of animals, Adam was still alone.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:01.100]   The dog is not man's best friend.
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:10.580]   Even though the world was teeming with wildlife, there was no one, no creature to be a companion
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.340]   with Adam.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:25.260]   God didn't create for Adam a nice dog, He didn't create for Adam a golfing buddy or
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.260]   a fishing buddy.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.900]   I know I've gone from preaching to meddling on that one.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.100]   He didn't create a mother for Adam or children for Adam.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.040]   He created a wife for Adam.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.800]   That's very significant.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:46.300]   She was the only one who could bring companionship into his life.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.740]   In a world that was teeming with life, Adam was alone.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.500]   Existentially, he understood that.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.720]   Personally, he understood that.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.540]   He was alone.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.660]   That's really key.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:11.580]   So God gave him the first anesthesia in verse 21, caused a deep sleep to fall upon him,
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.500]   which shows you, by the way, there was pain prior to the fall.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.260]   It's just that pain now has multiplied.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:22.480]   First anesthesia, put him to sleep, takes a rib, takes the rib that he had taken, forms
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.860]   the woman, and brings her to the man, and what does he do?
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:31.180]   He comes conscious again, "Wow, I'm married."
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.180]   He names her.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.180]   That's what he has.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:35.980]   That's what he's been doing the whole first day.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:43.740]   He says to her, now follow this, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:49.780]   Now, you kind of read over those words, but you shouldn't because the Hebrew words, the
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:54.900]   same Hebrew words are used one other time in the Bible, and it's used in 2 Samuel 5
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:01.340]   verse 1, where the people of Israel are swearing their allegiance to David as the future king
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.420]   of Israel.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.180]   They say, "Bone of bones, flesh of flesh."
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:11.900]   In other words, what they were doing was they were swearing and vowing that David was going
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.980]   to be their future king.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.940]   What is Adam doing here?
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:23.140]   Adam is saying to Eve, "Listen to this, bone of bones, flesh of flesh."
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.740]   In other words, this is the first marital vows.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:32.620]   He's swearing his allegiance to her, which is incredibly remarkable.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.900]   Why?
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:38.820]   Because Eve didn't have any other competition.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.500]   There were no other Eves running around.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.100]   She was the only one.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:49.780]   But even with her as the only one, he swears his allegiance.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.700]   And at that particular time, prior to sin coming into the world, they were going to
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   live forever.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.860]   So this was a forever vow.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.540]   It was a forever vow.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:05.700]   He swears his allegiance to her.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.460]   That's what should have happened when you got married.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:13.780]   You swear your allegiance to her.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.340]   Nothing on this planet should ever break that allegiance.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.900]   "Bone of bones, flesh of flesh.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.940]   She shall be called," now we translate this in the English, woman.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.340]   The Hebrew term here is Isha.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.660]   She shall be called Isha, and what does he do?
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:42.380]   He names her on the basis of her most common characteristic, because the core of the Hebrew
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.980]   word Isha is the word, "She shall be called soft."
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.540]   That's the idea.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:58.260]   She shall be called softy, all right?
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.260]   That's the idea.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.700]   And I don't know whether he went up and poked her.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:10.460]   Wow, soft compared to him, which is probably pretty hard and rugged.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.860]   Men like soft, okay?
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:21.020]   But there are a lot of women today trying to be like men and not be soft, which denies
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.100]   their essential characteristics in terms of femininity.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.180]   "No, no, no, no.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:32.380]   She shall be called softy because she was taken out of man."
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.540]   And then he says, this really is key, so you get this idea.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:44.780]   So God creates this suitable helper, a fitting completer, someone who is ideally suited for
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   him.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.780]   The animals wouldn't do.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.980]   God didn't create a father for Adam, a mother for Adam, a child for Adam, a sister for Adam.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:56.020]   A brother for Adam, a playmate for Adam, or even a golfing buddy or a hunting buddy for
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.020]   Adam.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   He created a wife for Adam.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:04.700]   That's what He created because no one else would ever be able to fulfill that need of
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.460]   companionship.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.060]   She was the one.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.840]   She's the one who could do that.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.020]   That's really key.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:27.300]   So, then, marriage now, in verse 24, Genesis 2, 24, is described by three key things, "Therefore,
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:31.700]   a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   one flesh.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.980]   And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed."
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:41.300]   I want you to understand this, that marriage now is later on referred to, Proverbs 2:17,
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.500]   Malachi 2:14, as a covenant.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:47.860]   The Hebrew term there is barit, and it actually means to cut a covenant.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.260]   That's the idea.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:57.460]   Because back in ancient times, a covenant was set by taking an animal, where today,
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.900]   when we make an agreement with someone else, we sign papers.
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.700]   When you buy your house, you have to sign papers, you buy your car, you have to sign
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.180]   papers, you make an agreement, I'm going to pay this off, you sign papers.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.980]   Back in ancient times, they didn't have any paper signing, but they would take an animal,
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:15.220]   and publicly, they would put that animal in front, and they would cut that animal in half,
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:19.920]   and the two parties would walk between the two halves of that animal, basically saying
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:28.900]   to everybody that was watching this, "May God do to us what has been done to this animal
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.360]   if we were to ever break this covenant."
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.660]   So that covenant was sealed in blood.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.760]   This animal was butchered, the two parts of the animal was laid on either side, the two
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.700]   parties walked between the two parts of the animal, and everybody understood what that
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.700]   meant.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.820]   It took that covenant to a new level.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:54.980]   Blood had to be shed in order to seal that particular covenant.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:59.220]   This is exactly what God intended marriage to be.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:09.340]   He intended it to be a barit, not burrito, that's Mexican, a barit, all right?
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:13.380]   That means a covenant, a sacred covenant.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:21.460]   It was considered a sacred, unbreakable bond, a lasting lifetime commitment between two
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.780]   people.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:32.260]   So it becomes a covenant, and it's manifested in verse 24 in three ways, three primary ways
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.340]   that this is manifested.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.420]   I want you to look at this carefully because this is really key.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.700]   The first one, which really speaks to the essential unity of marriage, the first one
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.420]   is leaving.
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.900]   "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother."
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:56.220]   This is God's commentary on what has happened with Adam and Eve at this particular point.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.380]   This is what God has intended.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:06.380]   So we're saying this, that from the very beginning, God intended the parent-child relationship
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:11.300]   to be temporary, not permanent.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:15.940]   Did you hear me on this?
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.980]   Temporary.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:27.100]   We raised all four of our kids to leave the home, not to stay, all right?
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:33.340]   And when the last one left, I started chasing Janie around the house, all right?
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.980]   We raised them to leave the home.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.260]   That's what should be happening, not to stay in the home.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:44.860]   We get a lot of Christian homes today that are very child-centered, as if when the children
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:50.180]   leave, there's no purpose for mom and dad to stay together any longer.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.440]   He's allowed that to happen.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.300]   She's allowed that to happen.
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.900]   I remember several years ago, while I was still a pastor in Ohio, we had a pastor's
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.740]   fellowship group of about 15 churches.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:05.180]   We got together once a month, pastors and wives, it was called a grace fellowship group.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:10.300]   One day we were sitting around at a luncheon and these pastors started sharing stories
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.100]   on how people in their congregations had been married 20, 25 years and all of a sudden they
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.060]   were announcing they were getting a divorce.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:20.180]   And we were all looking at each other saying, "What in the world is going on?"
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.740]   And so each one of the pastors who were sharing each one of those cases, we were asking them
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:28.140]   detailed questions about what was happening in the marriage and it came clear to everybody
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:36.220]   there that in every single case where there was a divorce occurring after 20, 25 years
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:41.220]   of marriage, they had homeschooled their kids.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:47.560]   Now I am not talking about, don't look at me evil here, because I homeschool my kids,
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.400]   so that was not the issue.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.980]   But what the issue was is when you do that kind of thing and you center your entire life
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:02.540]   around the children, it's easy to build your marriage around that.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:06.580]   You can't do that.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:11.180]   During the time that my wife and I still had children in the home, I would tell her, "Okay,
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.540]   this weekend we're going away.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.740]   I'm stepping away from my responsibilities at church.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.620]   It's just you and I going away for the weekend."
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.620]   "I can't.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:19.620]   We've got so many things for the kids."
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.620]   "No, no.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.620]   We're going to go away."
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:27.440]   And now we look back on that as some of the best times of our marriage.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.820]   Because what that does is, it's not wrong to homeschool your kids, I'm not saying that,
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.580]   so stop looking at me like you want to shoot me, all right?
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.020]   It's not wrong to do that.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:41.780]   What I'm saying is that it's very easy for a homeschooled family to have a child-centered
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.780]   home.
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:46.980]   Where the kids become the most important thing in the home, mom and dad's relationship is
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:51.460]   a distant second to that relationship.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:56.420]   We have a lot of homes in America today that are very child-centered.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.420]   Very child-centered.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:01.060]   And the moment the last kid leaves the home, then mom and dad look at each other and they
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.660]   shake hands and say, "Wow, we did a great job.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.660]   Thanks for your help."
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.120]   And they go two different directions.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.700]   That's what's going on.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:17.100]   You cannot allow that to happen in your home.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:22.020]   The husband-wife relationship is intended to be the permanent relationship in that home.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:30.580]   Children are to be reared to leave the home, not stay in the home, to leave the home.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.620]   There was an old song years ago, maybe some of you know it.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.420]   This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.420]   All right.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.820]   My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.500]   Well, I changed that song when my kids were little.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:52.300]   This house is not your home, you're just a passing through.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:59.580]   Your treasures are laid up with someone beyond the blue.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.220]   Now I have three of our four kids are married.
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:09.620]   We're trying to get the last one married, but there you go.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.940]   It's the husband-wife relationship that's supposed to be the permanent relationship.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:16.800]   That's what God intended.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.620]   It's not the parent-child relationship.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:27.700]   My wife was really good at saying to the family, like for example, I'd come home after a busy
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:32.180]   day at work, and one of the ways that she loved to demonstrate that, we would sit down
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:36.940]   for dinner, we would have prayer, and the first thing, she didn't let the kids touch
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:43.860]   anything on the table until dad was served, which was her way of saying, "He comes before
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.860]   you."
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.700]   Wow.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.460]   He comes before you.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.020]   When we go out to go anywhere in the car, guess what?
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.180]   I didn't run out and open the car door for the kids.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:03.900]   I went out and opened the car door for the wife, and once the wife was in the car, then
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.900]   I let them in.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:13.500]   I wanted them to see she came before them, year after year after year after year.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:16.860]   When I see my one son who's married, I have two daughters that are married too, but I
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:23.780]   see my one son doing the same thing with his wife, I'm going, "This worked.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.700]   I didn't have to teach him that.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.580]   All I had to do was just model it for him.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:33.420]   That's all I had to do."
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.420]   Parent-child relationship's temporary.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:40.340]   The husband-wife relationship is intended to be permanent.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.220]   Second thing is cleaving.
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.900]   Cleaving.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.820]   Now this is interesting.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:53.860]   In other words, the whole basis of the husband-wife relationship and the whole foundation is not,
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:57.580]   now fasten your seat belts, put your crash helmets on, ready?
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:01.620]   It's not romantic love.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.940]   Somebody sucked all the oxygen out of the room.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.860]   It's not.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:13.540]   Hollywood has sold us a bill of fare on this thing, down through American, European culture
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:16.780]   has sold us a bill of fare on this.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.540]   It's not romantic love.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:28.100]   The foundation of a marital relationship has to do with a sincere commitment before God.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.660]   The Bible doesn't say leave and love.
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:33.540]   It doesn't say leave and be infatuated by.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:39.100]   It doesn't say leave and enter into an intense romantic relationship with.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.700]   It says leave and cleave.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:46.980]   The Hebrew word there means to be glued together.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.940]   Leave and be glued to, right?
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.780]   Now why is that so important?
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:57.060]   Because it's only been relatively recent in history that you could choose who you're going
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.060]   to marry.
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:03.500]   Only the past couple hundred years has that happened, but a hundred years before that,
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.540]   mom and dad would usually choose who you had to marry, and guess what?
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.580]   You had to learn to love them.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.860]   You had to learn to love them.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.340]   Whoever mom and dad chose, that's what I was going to marry.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.460]   Because those choices are still made in different places around the world.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.380]   Mom and dad would choose who a son or a daughter is going to marry when they're five years
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.380]   old.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.020]   Everybody knows it as they're growing up.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:29.300]   You say, "Oh, that's so unromantic."
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:34.900]   Well, yeah, but I want to tell you that when the foundation of the entire marriage is based
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:42.420]   upon a cleaving commitment, when that's the case, that real intense romantic relationships
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.980]   grow out of that that's permanent.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:52.060]   It's not based upon the vacillating feelings of human emotion.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.180]   Not based upon that.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:01.340]   A guy marries a gal, I mean, she's just gorgeous, is exactly what he's always wanted to marry
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:06.060]   all of his life, and five years into marriage, he wakes up in the middle of the night, rolls
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:13.900]   over and her hair is all tangled, she doesn't have any makeup on, and she's there.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:20.140]   And all of a sudden he thinks, "Where did all the romance go?"
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:27.140]   And she wakes up in the middle of the night and there he is.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:32.620]   And she's thinking, "What have I done?
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.740]   What have I married?
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.540]   This is horrible.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.180]   My marriage is in trouble.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.820]   All the feelings are gone."
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.180]   Well, that's because you've been sold this bill of goods.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:50.100]   It's not based upon feelings, it's based upon a sacred commitment that you make before God
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:56.380]   where you glue yourself to that person for good.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.380]   That's what it means.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:03.540]   Listen, when I do premarital counseling, I catch couples in this right at the beginning.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.560]   I give them an assignment, all right?
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.060]   So if I ever do premarital counseling for you, well, hopefully I won't because you're
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:15.420]   already married, but I give them an assignment early in premarital counseling.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:21.780]   I say, "Okay, I want you to write out for me 20 reasons why you're marrying the person
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.780]   you're going to marry out of all the people on the planet.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.300]   Give me 20 reasons, I mean, you should be able to do that."
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:31.060]   And they look at me with starry eyes and go, "Oh, yeah, yeah, I can do that.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.060]   That's easy.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060]   That's easy to do."
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060]   I go, "Okay."
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:38.260]   So they go off a week, they're gone a week, and they come back in and they present their
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:43.420]   list to me, and I start looking at their list, and they all start out the standard way.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.580]   "Well, you know, I'm marrying him, I'm marrying her because they are just...
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.780]   I've never been so excited.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.740]   I've never had so much intense companionship with this person."
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:02.540]   And after all, that's what the Bible says.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:11.260]   And he's just incredibly handsome, he makes me weak in the knees, and she's incredibly
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   beautiful.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:16.740]   Oh, she's just gorgeous, and they're such godly people.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.380]   I mean, we can talk into the wee hours of the morning.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.940]   I mean, we can talk like this all the time.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.220]   I've never been able to talk with anybody like this.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.300]   And they go on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:34.060]   I can feel myself starting to get sick a little bit and all this.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.700]   So they're going on about this, and they're just beaming and, you know, and flowers are
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:42.340]   growing everywhere, and all this is going on.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.860]   All right, and all this is happening in premarital counseling.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:51.180]   And I look at them and then I get really serious and I say to them, "Wow, you know what?
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:56.260]   On the basis of your list, I hate to tell you this, but your marriage is already in
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:00.060]   trouble and you're not even married yet."
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:06.260]   "How could you say that?
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   This is my life, partner.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.260]   You can't say that.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.580]   You don't know anything about this."
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580]   "Your marriage is in trouble."
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.580]   "Well, why do you think it's in trouble?"
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.100]   "Well, so let me ask you a question.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.380]   You're marrying him because he's very handsome.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.300]   You can talk with him like nobody else.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.140]   He's a really godly guy.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.400]   He loves Jesus.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.180]   You know, he gets along with your family really, really well."
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:43.500]   Let's say the day after you get married, you're on your honeymoon, you're in a horrible car
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.100]   accident.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.380]   His head goes through the front windshield of the car, the prefrontal cortex of his brain
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.140]   is caved in, his whole personality changes.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.900]   He gets angry at God and denies Jesus, and now gets hateful.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.860]   He is ugly now.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.860]   He's defamed.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:04.460]   Based upon the reasons why you're marrying him, your marriage is in deep trouble on day
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.980]   two.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980]   It's in deep trouble."
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:16.060]   So about this particular point in the premarital counseling, they're sucking air.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.300]   "Well, why should we be getting married?"
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.940]   I'm glad you asked that question.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:34.980]   You're marrying them because you're giving your life to them regardless of what they
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:43.660]   bring to the table for a lifetime, regardless of what they bring to the table.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.700]   Now it's important that you get along.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.700]   That's good.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   That's icing on the cake.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.660]   That they love Jesus like you love Jesus.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:52.660]   That's important too.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.160]   That's icing on the cake too.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   That's really great.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   That has to be there.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.740]   Otherwise, the marriage shouldn't take place.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:06.380]   All of that's got to be there, but if you're marrying them for what they bring to the table
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:13.500]   and someday that's gone, then your entire reason for marrying them is gone.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:25.860]   The only altruistic reason to marry a person is I am giving my life to you to be your husband
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:31.580]   or your wife for the rest of my life.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.740]   Regardless of what you bring to the table or take off the table, that's what I'm going
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:39.860]   to do.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:43.880]   Now they're starting to sense the seriousness of marriage.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:51.460]   Now they're beginning to see it goes way beyond just merely that I feel really tingly every
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.940]   time I'm around them.
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:58.000]   It goes way beyond that.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.940]   This has to do with cleaving, that the basis of their relationship is that they are gluing
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.860]   themselves to that other person for a lifetime.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.860]   No exceptions.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:16.020]   They are gluing themselves to them.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.420]   So it means welding together.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.500]   That's the basis of the commitment.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.380]   The last thing has to do with one flesh.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:29.380]   Now this is much more than just the physical relationship in marriage.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.360]   It involves that.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.180]   It is the physical relationship in marriage, the sexual relationship in marriage is an
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:41.980]   expression of that marriage's companionship, but it goes way beyond that.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:48.100]   It means one in every sense of the word, like one in your philosophy of parenting.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:53.100]   One in the way in which you use your money together because you're one.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:56.220]   Your bank account should be one.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:01.380]   This is how you, the very fact that you have to work through how you're going to spend
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.380]   that money.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:09.700]   The very fact you have to do that, you have to harmonize your values, make you one.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.140]   That's really critical.
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.340]   One in every sense of the term.
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.500]   Spiritually you're one.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.660]   You view what the Bible says the same way together.
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:28.220]   You view Jesus Christ and love Jesus Christ together.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:32.380]   Spiritually you're one.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:38.700]   In all of these ways, you are weaving your life together.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.620]   Now our culture hates this, but in the Bible it's very good.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.860]   Have you ever seen an elderly couple that's been married several years?
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:53.380]   My wife and I are young ones, we've only been married 41 years, we're just young.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:09:01.500]   But I've had people in our church, my grandfather and my grandmother was married for 75 years.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   That's a long time.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.300]   They even got a letter from President Reagan and they celebrated their 75th.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:15.220]   Of course, he was 15 and she was 13 when they got married.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:21.780]   They'd be locked up today.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:28.340]   But 75 years of marriage where they become so one, they've lived together so much, he
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:32.020]   starts a sentence, she finishes it.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.540]   They have the same outlook on life.
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:40.740]   They even sound like they're talking the same way in everything that they do.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.540]   The culture says, "Oh, you lose your individuality."
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.540]   Yes!
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:51.340]   Yes, you do in the oneness of that relationship, and that's not bad.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:59.140]   It's a good thing because now you truly understand what companionship is.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.900]   You understand that.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:07.060]   We don't have that concept today.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.580]   That's a very sad thing.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:16.060]   So the three basic components, the leaving, the cleaving, the becoming one flesh, and
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:23.460]   the fact that the purpose of marriage is companionship upon those kind of principles, those are the
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.180]   basics now.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.340]   We're going to build everything else tomorrow.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.620]   You've been great tonight.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:38.340]   So thank you.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:43.180]   Let me close with a word of prayer and I'll turn it over to Pastor and he'll jump up here
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:48.540]   and give any kind of closing announcements that needs to take place here before you take
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.540]   off.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   Gracious Father, we are so grateful for your love and care for us.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:59.460]   We know that the Word of God was given and it is clarifying in all of its details, especially
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.380]   in regards to marriage.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:07.660]   It was given by you so that we could have clarity in a very confused world.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:14.220]   I pray, Father, that you'll help us to gain a very solid biblical concept of what marriage
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.780]   is and then tomorrow as we talk about the husband's role in marriage, the wife's role,
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:26.300]   the importance of communication that complements that companionship, and then the marital union,
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:31.820]   which has to do with what does the Bible say about the sexual relationship in marriage.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:39.260]   I pray that you'll help us to understand these things from your perspective and correct the
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.420]   areas that are wrong.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:48.980]   Help us, dear Lord, to learn to hate the things that are wrong, to hate how we have dealt
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:55.460]   with our marriage when it is violated what the Word of God has to say.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:56.900]   This we pray in Christ's name, Amen.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.740]   Amen.
