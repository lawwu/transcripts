[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.520]   Radical Personal Finance, quick tip today.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.600]   How much does it cost you to live today?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.920]   One of the major challenges that we face in our wealth building goals is making sense
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.360]   of all the numbers in life.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.600]   We know that wealth building and financial planning is fundamentally all about the numbers,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   but yet those numbers come and go and we don't often see the actual practical impact of those
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840]   numbers on a day-to-day basis.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.840]   This is especially magnified in our modern era where many of our transactions are digital
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.680]   and where many of our digital transactions are automatic.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.000]   The money comes in, the money goes out, it just flies through the checking account.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.440]   We don't have any tangible connection to the expenses.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.960]   And that can be a real challenge because it's very easy for our expenses to increase and
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   to total a lot more than we would otherwise think.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.240]   Now you're the one who gets to decide which expenses you value.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.200]   We all have different values systems.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.160]   We all have different measurements by which we measure the things that are valuable to
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.080]   us and the things that I find important to spend money on may be different than the things
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   that you find important to spend money on.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.200]   But the key to being able to make that judgment is having good data and being able to understand
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.760]   the data that's involved in your life.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.880]   And frankly, this is tough.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.080]   Here's an example.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.100]   How much money is your house costing you today in electricity?
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.640]   And I mean today, not this month.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.760]   I mean today, one day, one 24-hour period, which is an amount of time that we can easily
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.920]   connect with.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.800]   How much is it costing you today in electricity?
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.560]   Well, let me help you answer that question.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.720]   Let's pretend that your electric bill is $150 per month.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.040]   Take $150 this month and divide it by, usually what I do is divide it by 30.5.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.160]   If you remember that some months have 30 days, some months have 31, and February, of course,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   has 28.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.200]   If I use 30.5 as my easy number, that winds up with 366 days, which is close enough.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   So take $150 and divide that by 30.5, and you wind up with $4.92.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   So if your electrical bill costs you $150 per month, that means that today you're spending
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.480]   about $5 to light and heat and cool your home.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   Now I don't know if for you that would be a high number or a low number.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   I don't know if you would consider that to be a worthy expense or not a worthy expense,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.420]   but it's a number that you should know and that you should know, if not immediately,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.660]   you should at least be able to connect with it.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.560]   So here would be another example of a question.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.500]   How much does your household cost you on a daily basis?
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.000]   Now this is much simpler if you rent.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   Let me rephrase.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.360]   Instead of household, how much does your dwelling place cost you on a daily basis?
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.480]   This is much simpler if it's a rental cost because we can just measure pure cost.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.280]   Assume for a moment that your rent is $1,500 per month.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.160]   Assume that your electrical bill is $150 per month.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.680]   Assume that your water bill is $100 per month.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.080]   Assume that your cable, TV, and/or internet and/or satellite bills total $100 per month.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   And right now we're at $1,850 per month.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.440]   Now you may have a couple more bills, but let's just go with that.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.800]   $1,850 per month, your normal monthly cost.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.120]   How much is that per day?
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:34.000]   We'll divide by 30.5 and you have the number of $60.66 per day.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.900]   Now the great thing about doing these numbers is you're going to have some numbers that
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.000]   are useful to you to think about alternatives.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.020]   If that were your scenario, are you getting $60 per day of value from your dwelling place?
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020]   Maybe so, maybe not.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.480]   What else and how else could you spend that $60 per day?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.600]   Incidentally if you're a homeowner, you should do a similar type of analysis, but there are
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.800]   a few more steps involved.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.640]   The way that you would do that type of analysis as a homeowner is instead of your rental payment,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.880]   you would figure out the pure costs of your mortgage payment.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.680]   So pull out your taxes and your insurance, which those are in many ways equivalent to
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.800]   rental costs because they're just consistent expenses.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   You're not building any equity there.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.560]   And then do your best to, out of your principal and interest payment, do your best to figure
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   out what you think your house is actually costing you over the course of a year.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.320]   And it will be more challenging because you'll have to bring in improvements, maintenance,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.240]   other types of expenses, things like that.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.840]   It may be simpler.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   Just use your mortgage payment.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.400]   It's probably a fair enough assessment of what your costs would be because for most
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.120]   people my guess would be that any potential increases of the value of the property would
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.880]   be offset by expenses and improvements that you would make in the property.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.920]   Most people don't come out too much ahead on their house.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.760]   If you think you're going to come out ahead, go ahead and adjust that a little bit.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.180]   But figure out what is your daily expense.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.120]   The cool thing about doing this math is it gives you a basis for comparison that may
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.520]   be very useful to you.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.360]   Pretend for a moment that you wanted to live in multiple places and during the year 2018,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.640]   instead of staying in one rental apartment in one city, you wanted to move around.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.160]   Well, what could you get in terms of a daily rental rate or a weekly rental rate?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.000]   You can jump onto Airbnb and if your current cost is $60 per day for your dwelling, you
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.400]   could jump onto Airbnb and look around and see what you can rent for $60 per day and
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.960]   you know that you would have an equivalent cost to what you're spending right now.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.240]   Or maybe you would like to do some traveling and you look at hotel costs.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.440]   Or maybe you intend to buy a boat and live on a boat and so you try to figure out how
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.360]   much your boat payment would cost you and how much your marina fees would cost, etc.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.000]   But that's a very useful number for you to know, that daily number, because then it opens
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.960]   up points of comparison.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.880]   Frequently people don't make accurate comparisons because they don't have an accurate understanding
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.720]   of what the numbers mean.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.840]   You're used to writing that $1,500 a check every month for your rent.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.000]   You're used to writing that $2,500 a month check for your mortgage payment and you don't
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   think about alternatives.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.520]   But sometimes if you'll just convert that into a daily expense, it'll open your eyes
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.440]   to something new.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.800]   I've just done this analysis for myself and you can do this incidentally with just any
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   of your payments.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.760]   If you have a monthly payment, you don't need a full year's worth of data or you can do
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.400]   it with a full year's worth of data.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.440]   It's January 2018 as I record and release this episode of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.280]   That means that you should have a year of data accumulated from 2017 and you can look
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   back.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.120]   I've been doing this analysis because one of our plans during 2018 is to do some extended
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.440]   RV travel.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.200]   I'll share more about that on a future episode as far as our specific plans, but we intend
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:19.320]   to take a multi-month trip around the United States with the goal of meeting you.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   But in order for me to understand those expenses, I need to compare what would be my expenses
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.920]   on the road versus the current expenses.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.040]   I can do that very effectively with a daily budget.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.400]   You can also do this just to get an idea of your normal expenses that you're always going
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.240]   to incur and try to figure out what they actually would mean to you on a daily basis.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.900]   Let me give you an example from my own budget.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:52.520]   During the year 2017, Mrs. Radical Personal Finance and I spent a total of $7,934.41 on
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.060]   groceries.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.060]   Now that grocery category in my tracking system is inclusive of paper products and things
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.240]   like bottled water, but any kind of food-related thing.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.640]   Going forward, one of the things that I'm changing in my own accounting system is to
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.320]   be more discriminating in my subcategories.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.880]   My general philosophy regarding budgeting is keep it as absolutely simple as possible,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.440]   meaning in many cases as few categories as possible, but it must be detailed enough to
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.520]   be helpful for you.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:33.160]   So that number of $7,934 comes out to a total monthly of $661.20 per month as far as a monthly
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   average.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.800]   Now, the reason that that number feels high to me and it's frustrating to me, I feel
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.200]   like it should be at least under $500 a month.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   In my mind, that would be a reasonable budget for a family of five, but one of the – of
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.240]   course the youngest is only just starting solid food and the other two really don't
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.280]   eat that much.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   But I feel like that's a sloppy number and I need to tighten that number up.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   So when I look at it on a daily basis and I calculate it, it comes out to $21.74 per
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:10.280]   day for groceries and paper products.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.480]   When I think about that, it's actually not quite so unreasonable to me in that case.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:25.680]   To feed four people every day for $21.74 at three meals per day, that comes out to $7.25
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.120]   per meal.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.680]   Is that awful?
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.800]   Well, I feel like it's unnecessarily high, but I don't think it's necessarily awful.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.660]   Now another interesting thing that I calculated was fuel use.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:47.800]   During the year of 2017, we spent $1,936.50 on fuel.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.760]   Total is $161.38 per month and that's $5.31 per day.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.880]   It's interesting because fuel is one of those things that I don't think we actually
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.360]   use very much.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.920]   We live in a county and have a geographic lifestyle.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.600]   The county that we live in is huge and our lifestyle is very spread out.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.360]   But I don't drive for work and my wife doesn't drive for work.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.000]   So all of those miles are personal roundabout miles.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.480]   But $5.31, that feels high to me.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:26.640]   I didn't really realize that we're spending $5.31 per day on fuel.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.680]   There are other interesting categories as well.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.400]   For example, one of the ones that has been rough the last year, a couple years for our
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.760]   budget has been the expenses for our dogs.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:48.400]   My total spending on dog expenses for 2017 was $2,063.21 which comes out to $5.65 per
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   day.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.720]   Now that's a very high number, $171.93 per month.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.240]   It's a very high number because my dog has had some extensive health issues and he has
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.840]   a specialized dermatologist veterinarian and we've gone through all kinds of things.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   He's on an expensive medication right now which has solved some of the problems.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.480]   We've tried all kinds of different treatments, tried changing foods, tried changing supplements,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.720]   all kinds of different things and we're still trying to get that budget category under control.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   But it's a little sobering to look and say $5.65 a day?
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:30.720]   I love my puppies so I've spent the money but well, it's illuminating to have that daily
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   number.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.480]   I don't need to go on with my examples.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   What are yours?
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.760]   What are your monthly expenses?
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.720]   If I paid you $10 a day to cut your grocery bill in half, would it be worth it to you?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   For me it would.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.200]   When I look at that number, that $20 a day number for feeding my family on groceries,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.600]   I look at that and I think, $21, sorry, $22 number, I look at that and I think, "Well,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:06.000]   you know, it's not awful but it's probably worth $12 a day to me if I could cut that
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.440]   number in half."
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.720]   So let me focus more intensely.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:17.520]   Let me stop being sloppy with that category because if you told me and put it into context
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.000]   and say, "Joshua, if you can cut your bill from $22 a day to $12 a day and you're going
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.080]   to get an extra $10 bill stuffed into your wallet every single day of 2018, are you willing
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.800]   to do that?"
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.520]   I'm willing to do that, especially when that's after-tax money.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.360]   If depending on your tax rate, that $10 a day extra money in your pocket could be worth
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:50.760]   an extra $13, $12, $13, $14 a day that you'd have to earn an hour of labor per day every
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.760]   day.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.120]   I challenge you to do your own analysis.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.720]   And again, here's how you do it.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:05.140]   If you have data for the year 2017, take that data and if you are competent with a spreadsheet,
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.220]   put into the spreadsheet your annual expenditures.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:16.260]   If you use a personal finance software platform such as YNAB, the You Need a Budget software
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:23.620]   that I use that I recommend to you, radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab, make me a little cash for doing the show.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.620]   I appreciate that.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.620]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.340]   So if you use a software like YNAB, that's great.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:35.100]   If you use Mint for categorizing your transactions, if you use Quicken, if you use Tiller, you
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.780]   have a Tiller spreadsheet.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.540]   I forget my – maybe it's radicalpersonalfinance.com/tiller.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.180]   Go to the website and there's a link through for Tiller or tell them, "Joshua, Radical
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.660]   Personal Finance sent you."
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.340]   If you use Quicken, et cetera, just export the data from 2017, your totals, drop it into
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.300]   a spreadsheet and run a couple of formulas.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:59.600]   Take your annual total, divide it by 365 and get your daily totals and then divide that
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.700]   annual by 365 and get your monthly totals.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.780]   So that's a simple way to do it if you have good data for the past calendar year or for
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.060]   the past rolling 12-month period that you're listening to this show.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.420]   Another way to do it is just simply take your expense, take the monthly bill that you have
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.460]   and figure it out for yourself.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:26.700]   With a monthly bill, I recommend you go smaller down to daily and then bigger up to annual
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:32.100]   because this will impress upon you the value of certain changes.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:38.900]   Assume for a moment that your internet and TV bill is $100 per month.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.980]   Well, question.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.860]   Do you really need that?
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.740]   For example, on TV, did you know that you can get free TV that just comes through the
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.100]   air if you need TV?
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.540]   Or did you know that you can get free DVDs from the library?
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.320]   Did you know that you can read a book?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.100]   With your internet usage, do you really need to have a separate high-speed internet line
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.220]   into your home?
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.240]   For some people, that's an absolute necessity, but for others, that's a total option.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.300]   Maybe you can get by with just using your phone here and there for internet if you have
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.180]   a data plan on your phone, or you can just use the internet and do whatever necessary
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.060]   internet work you have while you're at the office or at another location.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:23.500]   $100 a month dropped down to a daily expense comes out to $3.30 per day.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:29.980]   Is it worth it to you to pay $3.30 per day?
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.700]   Or multiply it by 12, and let me ask you this question.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:40.560]   At the end of 2018, if you could cut your internet bill and your TV bill by $100, would
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:47.460]   you rather have an extra $1,200 in your savings account?
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.860]   Would you rather have an extra $1,200 of your debt paid off?
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:57.060]   Would you rather have an extra $1,200 available for your investments?
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:03.500]   The choice is yours, and it all comes down to your expenses.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.820]   So take, if you don't have records for the last year, take your monthly bills and run
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.300]   them through this analysis.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.820]   I encourage you, don't discriminate.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.580]   Run all of your bills through this analysis.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580]   You can just do it by hand.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.580]   Write them down.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.860]   Write down your categories on a sheet of paper and calculate it out, and then look at each
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.780]   one and say, "Am I satisfied with this?"
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.540]   If the answer is yes, good.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:41.540]   The goal of life is not to spend the least amount of money possible.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:49.980]   The goal with your expenditures is to spend the least amount of money possible to buy
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:56.540]   the lifestyle that you believe is important for you at this stage of your life.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.700]   There's a balance, and less is not always better.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.740]   One recommendation in frugality is this.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:12.300]   Cut your expenses down to where you're uncomfortable and then increase them slightly.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:19.980]   If you live at the ragged edge of discomfort all the time, you will probably find that
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.980]   very wearing.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.060]   If you have an aggressive financial goal to get out of debt by a certain time or to save
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.180]   a certain amount of money for a down payment on a house or to become financially independent
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:36.220]   by your 35th birthday, etc., then living on that ragged edge of discomfort may be what
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.220]   you can do.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:43.460]   As long as that goal is in your sights, you can push yourself through to that.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.420]   Don't keep yourself on that ragged edge of discomfort for the long term if you don't
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.260]   have some impressive goal that you're working towards.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:19:00.660]   Take yourself down to that point of being uncomfortable in your expenses and then increase
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.660]   just a little bit.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.740]   I think that's where you get the best bang for your buck.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.780]   Have a great 2018.
