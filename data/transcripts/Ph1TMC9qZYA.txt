[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.880]   - Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.640]   is doing with SpaceX in general?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.920]   Space, the idea of space exploration,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.640]   even though you're, or your species is young and impatient?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.280]   - Yeah, no, I do think that space travel
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.260]   is crucially important, long-term,
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.800]   even to other star systems.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800]   And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.240]   because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.760]   to another star system, we'll be dead
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.320]   before we get there, right?
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.480]   And I think that it's much easier,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.400]   and therefore, when they write their science fiction stories,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.880]   they imagine we could go faster than the speed of light
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.980]   'cause otherwise they're too impatient, right?
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.880]   We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.300]   but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.400]   gets extended to thousands of years.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.440]   And once you do that,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.480]   then the stars are much closer, effectively, right?
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.560]   I mean, what's a hundred year trip, right?
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.120]   So I think that that's gonna be the future,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.000]   the far future, not my lifetime once again,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.640]   but baby steps.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.720]   - Unless your lifetime gets extended.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   - Well, it's in a race against time, right?
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.640]   A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.720]   said, you know, you and I are gonna die,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.320]   but I don't know about our grandchildren.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.240]   That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.200]   but that's at least a plausible scenario.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.080]   And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.400]   there are threats to the earth,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   known and unknown, right?
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.260]   is a really important long-term goal.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.740]   (upbeat music)
