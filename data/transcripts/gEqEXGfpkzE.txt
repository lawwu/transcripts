[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   I like to divide things into what I call early stage planning and late stage planning.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.760]   So early stage planning is college is someday, I've got a four-year-old, we've got some extra
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.320]   cash flow, maybe we should save it and invest for college.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   Okay.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   You know, whether you do it or not, that's great.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.320]   But then we get to what I call late stage college planning.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.960]   Now you've got a high school, sophomore, junior, senior, and you're there.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.600]   And you may have done a great job of saving a big pile of money, but that you're still
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   not done, right?
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.200]   You've got a lot of work to do around visiting colleges, figuring out just because I have
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.680]   it, do I have to spend it?
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680]   Should I spend it?
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.440]   How much is a reasonable amount to spend for college?
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.560]   Are the privates worth it?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.840]   Are the public's worth it?
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.880]   All that work that needs to be done.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   Using loans to fill the gaps, filling out financial aid, all that stuff.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.600]   That should start, in my opinion, freshman, sophomore year, especially for your first.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.960]   Because it's a learning curve of, well, I need to understand, will we qualify for need-based
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   aid?
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.440]   Will we qualify for merit aid?
