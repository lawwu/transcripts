[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.640]   Paul's second epistle to Timothy in the first chapter, the twelfth verse. The twelfth verse
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.720]   in the first chapter of Paul's second epistle to Timothy, "For the which cause I also suffer
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.880]   these things. Nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.520]   that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day." Now,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.320]   we are looking at this great statement of the apostle, this tremendous assertion, which
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.080]   is such a perfect representation of the message of the Christian faith to the world tonight.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.120]   This is what Christianity is about. This is what it offers. It enables the men to face
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.840]   life and to face death, to face everything, in the way that this great and mighty apostle
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.560]   did. Now, don't forget that when he wrote these words, he was writing from prison. He
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.400]   was suffering these things. He is referring there to his imprisonment. And what he is
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.600]   saying is that though he is imprisoned, and though his whole life is in a most precarious
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.200]   position, lying entirely at the whim of that most capricious of Roman emperors, the emperor
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.520]   Nero, but the apostle says, "It's all right. I'm not disturbed. I'm not disappointed.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.480]   My world hasn't crashed. I don't think it's the end of all things. I'm not put
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   out at all. I'm not ashamed." In other words, I'm trying to suggest that the Christian
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.880]   message is a message that always starts with the word "nevertheless." Yet, it's
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.960]   a protest against everything else. And it is this triumphant assertion that the Christian
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.320]   faith is something which can make a man more than conqueror against anything and everything
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.440]   that may chance to come to meet him. Now, as we are dealing with this for the
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.840]   ninth Sunday evening, and the reason for that is that, as I've been trying to explain,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   this isn't just an isolated statement. The Christian message and the Christian comfort,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.520]   the Christian consolation, the Christian hope, is never an isolated message. It's a part
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   of a greater whole. In other words, I've been showing you how the great apostle is
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.200]   able to speak like this, not because he happened to be that sort of man, not because he was
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   a man with what's called the sanguine temperament, not a born optimist, not one of these men
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.120]   who always comes up, as we say, with a smile. I can't imagine anything further removed
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   from the apostle Paul than just that. He is a man who's naturally what they sometimes
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.280]   call the twice-born type, a man whom, I'm sure, was given by nature to morbidity and
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.600]   introspection, a man who tells us himself, about himself in the second epistle to the
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.720]   Corinthians in chapter 7, that he was in this sort of state very often, "fightings without,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.840]   fears within." That's the sort of man he was. But here he is, he's able to overcome
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.920]   it all, and he tells us why. There's only one reason. It's because he believes the
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:31.080]   gospel. "I know him whom I have believed." It's the sole explanation of his entire position.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.960]   And now he's writing like this in order to comfort this young friend of his, this
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.080]   young minister whose name was Timothy, who was very dejected at this point, very troubled,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   full of fear. He was put out and alarmed because the great apostle was in prison and might
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.480]   be put to death at any moment. And he was tempted to think that when Paul went, well,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.680]   the whole thing would collapse, that Christianity depended upon this one man, this one preacher.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.080]   And so his whole world was shaking, and the apostle writes to him, and he reprimands him.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.440]   What a foolish preacher. Here's a preacher who'd forgotten his own sermon. Here's a
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.200]   preacher who doesn't practice what he preaches to others. A preacher, he says, a Christian
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.860]   has no right to be like this. And so he writes to upbraid him and to chastise him and to
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.800]   remind him of the great fundamentals of the Christian faith, whereby alone a man can be
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.120]   enabled to become more than conqueror. Why on earth, says Paul in effect to Timothy,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.080]   why don't you remember the things that you've heard from me, the things that you really
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.740]   believe and the things that you preach to others? Now, I'm trying to show, therefore,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.520]   that if we would have the experience of Paul and be able to face life and death and everything
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.360]   as he did, we then must believe what he believed. We must believe the gospel. And you can't
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.000]   believe a thing unless you know what it is. Well, fortunately here he gives us a most
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.120]   amazing summary of his gospel, and that is what we are looking at Sunday by Sunday. Now
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.280]   then, I'm going to read the whole passage again, because you can't take this text out
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.320]   of its context. The context really is vital to it. He starts in verse 6, "Wherefore, I
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.920]   put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:25.040]   on of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.640]   and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.600]   of me his prisoner. But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according by
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:47.320]   means of or through the power of God, who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.840]   not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.240]   us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.760]   of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, dissolved it, taken it to pieces, taken
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.080]   its power, taken the sting out of it, and hath brought life and immortality to light
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.000]   through his gospel. Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.760]   the Gentiles, for the which cause also I suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.240]   for I know him whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.480]   I have committed unto him against that day. Hold fast the form of sound words which thou
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.600]   hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus, that good thing, that
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.040]   deposit which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.880]   Very well. Now then, you see, there he is explained that it is all the result of his
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.040]   believing the gospel. And what is the gospel? Well, there's no difficulty about knowing
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.640]   what the gospel is. Let the clever people say what they like. This is the gospel, and
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:18.160]   it's all in this blessed person Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, him whom
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.520]   I have believed. It's all in him. He who existed before the world was, but who has
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.760]   been manifested. He's come into this world. So, you see, we've dealt with the life and
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.200]   death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ because he's abolished death. He's done
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.320]   that in his resurrection and has brought life and immortality to light. This is the gospel.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.800]   And it is this which we have to believe, and what we've seen is this.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   This is a message that tells us that this is God's world and he's got a purpose for
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:57.560]   it. That when all the statesmen and the philosophers and all the rest of them have finished, it
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:05.160]   isn't the end, it's really only the beginning. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. And
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.760]   God has planned and purposed it all before the world, and he's put it into practice
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.280]   in his Son. What is it? What do we need? What have we got to believe? Well, like Paul, we've
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.880]   got to believe that we are sinners, that we are under the wrath of God. But that God has
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   saved us. Not we ourselves, not according to our works, but that God has saved us in
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.360]   Christ. That Christ has borne our sins and their punishment, has reconciled us to God.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.560]   We can be forgiven. We can be reconciled to God. Not only that we saw last Sunday night,
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.760]   that we become the children of God. We become born again, this holy calling, this new life
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.840]   into which he leads us. A Christian is not merely a man who is forgiven, he's changed,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.880]   changed completely, undergoes a rebirth, regeneration, new creation. These are the terms that are
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.600]   used about this tremendous thing that happens in a man who becomes a Christian. He becomes
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.880]   a new man with a new outlook, new desires, new hopes, new everything.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.760]   Now then, that's the point at which we've arrived and at which we take up this evening,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   because I imagine somebody still has got a question to put to me. All right, they may
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.720]   say, that's all right, I believe that, I accept that. But still, you know, a man's got to
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.320]   live in this world. And how can a man live in a world like this? You say, believe this,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.800]   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. All right, that's all right in a chapel. But then I go
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.760]   back into the world, and the world is exactly as it was before I came in here. How can I
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.400]   live? There's the world, the flesh, the devil, the powers that are set against me. How can
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:48.000]   I live? Have you anything to say there? Has the gospel anything to say at that point?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.840]   Well, the apostle makes it perfectly plain and clear that it has. What is the answer?
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.520]   The answer is the gift of the Holy Spirit, and what the Holy Spirit does to us, and what
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:10.480]   he does in us, and what he enables us to do. Now this is the great thing that the apostle
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   holds before us here, and to which I'm directing your attention this evening. Now, the way
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.960]   in which the apostle puts this, I think you'll all agree, is extremely interesting. We are
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   concentrating tonight especially on verse 7. "God," he says, "hath not given us the spirit
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:36.440]   of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind, or of discipline." Now, why
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   does he put it like that? Well, he does it for this reason. The trouble with Timothy
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:49.160]   at this point was that he was suffering from what you may call the spirit of fear. And
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.640]   the apostle says, "You know, we were not meant to be like that. That's not the spirit that
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.760]   we've been given." But that was the condition of Timothy, and when a man is defeated by
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:05.560]   life, it is always due ultimately to the fact that he is suffering from this spirit of fear.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:13.000]   Now I want to try to show you tonight that in reality this is the real cause, the ultimate
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.920]   cause of all failure in life, all unhappiness. This spirit of fear. This is the thing that
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:29.160]   gets us down. This is the thing that defeats us all by nature, the spirit of fear.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.640]   Now I read to you at the beginning that portion out of the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:44.240]   Because it seems to me to be such a perfect summary of the whole story of the human race.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.640]   You see, there we were shown very clearly that the first result of the fall of men was
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.600]   fear. God had made men in his own image, he'd made him perfect, he'd put him in paradise,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.200]   and there was nothing that men in that condition enjoyed more than the company of God. He was
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.800]   made for communion with God, and he enjoyed communion with God. And when men heard the
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.440]   voice of God, as it were, coming into the garden, men rushed to meet him. There was
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.800]   nothing that gave him greater pleasure. But after that act of rebellion and disobedience
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.920]   and defiance of God, you remember what happened? The moment they'd sinned, they were filled
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.960]   with fear. They found they were naked, and they were filled with the spirit of fear,
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.520]   and they went to hide themselves behind the trees. And they heard the voice of the Lord
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:44.680]   God, and God calling out, "Adam, where art thou?" And Adam and Eve emerged trembling,
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:52.040]   frightened, alarmed. And Adam says in all innocence and honesty, "I heard thy voice,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:58.240]   and I was afraid." For the first time in their lives, Adam and Eve were filled with
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.800]   a spirit of fear. There had been no fear in Eden until this act. Now, this is the whole
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:11.560]   philosophy of life. This is, in a sense, the essence of the whole of the biblical teaching.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:19.440]   Man has always thought that he can obtain liberty and happiness and satisfaction and
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:27.760]   peace and joy by rebelling against God. That's the popular teaching today. It's a repetition
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:33.560]   of the first sin. People say, "Don't be interested any longer in this religion. What
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.320]   is it?" "Ah, it's the dope of the masses, the opiate of the people. Call it what you
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.080]   like." And others put it like this. They say, "Of course, religion and the church
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.040]   have held people down in the past because they've used this weapon of fear. They've
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.840]   filled them with terror and alarm. They've held them before the wrath of an angry God.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.200]   And so men and women, in their ignorance, they were afraid, and they believed it, and
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:03.480]   they were nothing but sheer slaves. And they fondly believed that the way to find emancipation
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:10.360]   and freedom and peace and rest and liberty and enjoyment and the loss of all fear of
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.320]   life is to turn your back upon God and to rebel and to live your own life in your own
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:22.960]   way. But you see, the whole biblical case amounts to this, that it works exactly the
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:30.640]   other way around, that it is because men turns away from God that he gets possessed by the
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.920]   spirit of fear, that there never would have been fear at all in the human race were it
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.880]   not for man's fall and departure from God. It brought in this element of fear, and it's
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.320]   here still. And I want to try to show you that it is the main and dominant element in
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.720]   the life of this world at this very moment, and it is the main cause why so many people
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.640]   are utterly defeated. Now then, the apostle puts it like this at once to Timothy. Timothy
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.760]   says, "You know, you're behaving exactly as if you were not a Christian." That is how
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.920]   I expect a man who's not a Christian to react to what's happening to me and what may happen
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.520]   to him. But he says, "You know, God hath not given us, who are Christians, we've not been
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.240]   given the spirit of fear." That's the spirit of the world. Now, the apostle, you know,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.440]   had to say this very often. He says exactly the same thing in slightly different language
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:33.080]   to the Romans when he puts it like this. "God hath not given us the spirit of bondage against
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:42.080]   fear, but God hath given us the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.920]   One thing exactly. Well now then, let us examine this together. So let me take as my first
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.840]   point, what are the causes of this fear, this spirit of fear? This is the trouble in life
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.360]   men and women are afraid. What are we afraid of by nature? Well, of course, I'm ready to
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:06.000]   grant that there is, in many cases, a kind of individual and personal element. We're
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.460]   not all the same. Thank God we're not. But we're not all the same. And there are some
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:18.160]   people who are more fearful by nature than others. As I've told you, this young man Timothy
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.480]   was obviously a case of that. And likewise, I believe the apostle Paul himself was, by
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.520]   nature, as a natural man. That element does come in. We needn't stay with that because
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:35.040]   the whole case of the gospel is to say that it doesn't matter what you are by nature.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.120]   I hope I've made that perfectly clear. I tried to bring up that point in my first sermon
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:47.440]   on this text. Here in this realm, it doesn't matter at all what your natural make-up is.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   There is nothing more wonderful to me about the long history of the Christian church than
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:59.400]   the way in which you find in the same church, sharing the same experience, men and women
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:05.320]   of every conceivable type of temperament, psychology, personality, call it what you
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.840]   like. You've got your optimists and pessimists. You've got your sanguine, hopeful people.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.040]   And you've got your people who always look at the darker side. You've got your mercurial
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.080]   people, your phlegmatic people. Oh, thank God for this. It doesn't matter what you are.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.080]   And let me add to that, it doesn't matter what your nationality is. Nationality does
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.240]   make a difference, and it is important. And every man who belongs to any nationality has
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.600]   got things to fight in particular that others haven't. And he's got strength that others
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.480]   haven't. But it doesn't matter at all when you come here, whatever you are. Thank God
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:42.080]   for this. Whatever the color of your skin, whatever your background, whatever your cultural
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:49.560]   antecedents, it doesn't matter at all. We are dealing here with the power of God, with
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:56.360]   what God can do to a man and what God can make of a man. I'm granting that the individual
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:02.560]   make-up plays a part. Everybody's got some peculiar something to fight above everything
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.120]   else. It isn't always the same, but we are all enabled to fight in the same way. That's
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.240]   the message. Well, now then, let's look at the more general
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.520]   causes, therefore, of this spirit of fear. I'm asserting that this is one of the most
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.080]   fearful generations that the world has ever known. I'm asserting that there's nothing
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.600]   more obvious about the life of this country and of the world tonight than this spirit
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.160]   of fear. What's it due to? Well, I would suggest that the first cause is what we may
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:42.160]   call finitude. Finitude. Man's consciousness of the fact that he is finite, or if you like,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.720]   the fact that he is so small. Now, it's not surprising that this should be the cause,
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:54.700]   and a very prolific cause, of much fear in this present age and generation. We are living
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:01.520]   in what is called an expanding universe. You see, the psalmist, even in his day, was able
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:09.560]   to say, "When I consider the sun and the moon and the stars, what is man, that thou
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.000]   art mindful of him." Well, he didn't know much about science, did he? Well, now, we
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.680]   know so much about science, and we see this expanding universe. We hear these scientists
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.720]   talking about billions of light years, whatever that may mean, that they talk about them,
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.920]   and these tremendous, almost infinite distances, and these great powers and forces, and of
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.520]   course, you can't hear about these things or read about them without feeling that you're
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.900]   very small. You see, this is the extraordinary contradiction in modern men. He's very big
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.460]   when he looks at himself intellectually, and he thinks he can encompass the whole cosmos.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.240]   And then, when he thinks of these powers in what Sir James Jeans called this mysterious
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:03.600]   universe, he feels so small. The vastness of space, those illimitable distances, the
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:12.480]   Milky Way, are there in that vastness, which is without end, as it were, what is man. Finiteum.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.040]   And you know, a man who rarely thinks at all must be frightened by all this. It's a very
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.520]   alarming thought. Well, then, let me expand that a little. Take, then, all these unseen
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:30.680]   forces and powers that have been discovered, and in a sense released by science. Take the
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.960]   power, the force in an atom. In an atom, that tremendous power. And you see, it is the splitting
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.200]   of the atom that has released this atomic power. And when you think that the whole cosmos
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:51.600]   is made up of this tremendous power and force, living in that, well, indescribable tension,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.400]   you begin to feel afraid, and you wonder where you are. You're in a world of such forces
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.560]   and powers. Did you hear that thunder clap around about six o'clock? Didn't it frighten
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.400]   you? Well, it should have done. It frightened me. There's something tremendously frightening
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:14.840]   about it. This unseen power, what is it? This electric force, these explosions. And here
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:22.000]   are we, in a world like this, this vast, tremendous world. Now, this is a part of what I'm describing
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.440]   as the finitude of man. And then, what brings it right home to us, of course, is our realization
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.680]   of our ignorance. You see, while we are boasting about our advance in knowledge, there is a
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.400]   sense in which it's equally true to say that the more our knowledge advances, the more
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:49.360]   we are discovering how little we know. We don't understand it. The universe is mysterious.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   And we discover this bit and that bit, and we get very excited. But, oh, what we don't
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.240]   understand, it's like an iceberg. We've just discovered that little bit that's out above
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.320]   the surface, but the nine-tenths, it's down below. And what is it? Who knows what it is?
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.960]   So we begin to say with tennyson, "Our little systems have their day, they have their day,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:16.160]   and cease to be. They are but broken lights of thee, and thou, O God, art more than they."
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.240]   How little we understand, how small are our little philosophies, after all. Man is thus
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.840]   made to feel his finitude. And you see, it's exactly like a man being out, as it were,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.240]   in some unknown place in the dark, and he wonders what's there, what's behind that
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:37.440]   hedge, what may be coming round that corner. He doesn't know. The unknown element and quality,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:45.440]   this vastness, the greatness of the powers. And man is but a small creature, or he's like
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.480]   a man in a little yacht, or even a smaller rowing boat, in a great ocean. And there are
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.680]   billows and powers, and you never know. There it is. That is how man feels by nature, the
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.880]   moment he begins to explore his universe. He's impressed by nothing more than by his
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:09.920]   sense of finitude. What else? Well, the other factor is, I think, the meaninglessness of
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   life, and the purposelessness of life. I'm talking now about a man who's not a Christian.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.880]   Because you see, these very scientists who tell us about this great and mysterious universe
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:27.240]   are the same people who are telling us that life is meaningless, that life is purposeless,
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.600]   that there's no object in it all, it leads to nothing. They can't prophesy anything.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.820]   They can't tell us with assurance that the world is going to get better and better. Some
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.000]   of them do, but the realists among them tell us that they can't say that, they're not
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.560]   entitled to say that. You see, it's all being governed by some blind, non-personal force.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.880]   And you don't know what a force is going to do. It may go up, it may go down, it may improve
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.560]   yet more wonderful forms, or it may explode the whole thing and there's the end. You don't
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:02.160]   know. There's no mind, there's no person at the back. So you see, the modern man has been
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.560]   taught this and he feels that life is meaningless, it's got no purpose. Well, then he says, "Well,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.880]   why should I live? What's the point of living? There's nothing to strive for, there's no
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.920]   objective to make for, and all this leads to a kind of slackness and indolence, and
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.640]   that in turn leads to a spirit of fear. Because while you, as it were, are saying, "Well,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.080]   what's the use of anything and there's no point in striving if it's all going to end
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.880]   in nothing or I don't know what it's going to end in?" You sit down and you do nothing,
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.200]   but these other forces and powers are there, and your indolence and the vastness again
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.800]   come together and they increase your sense of fear, and then add to all this the sense
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:46.080]   of insecurity. And there's nothing that is so frightening as a sense of insecurity, the
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:53.280]   fear of the unknown. Here we are, thank God for all our knowledge we save, and then you
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.240]   begin to say, "Well, what if I'm suddenly taken ill? What if illness should come? I'm
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.280]   enjoying life, everything's very wonderful, I'm surrounded, wife and family, everything
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:08.800]   going well, affluent society. What if I'm taken ill? What if I lose my health? What
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.600]   if I suffer some grievous loss?" Life is so insecure, there's the unknown, you never
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.320]   know what's going to happen. Life is full of such tremendous possibilities, you can't
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.600]   forecast, you don't know what's coming. People rush to fortune tellers because they
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:28.240]   want to know, but you see they can't tell them. But this interest in astrology and so
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.160]   on, it's the fear of the unknown. "How many years have I got? What's it going to
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.680]   be like? If only I knew I could do something, but I don't know." And you can't know.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:47.040]   Fear of the unknown, illness, loss, possibility of another war. War shatters plans and purposes.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.600]   Then we are being told increasingly this terrible possibility of famine, world famine, because
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.720]   of the population explosion, because of the erosion of the soil, because the population
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.360]   by the year 2000 is going to be double what it was in the early 50s, there isn't going
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.200]   to be enough food for everybody, we are faced with the possibility of famine. And there
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.960]   always in the background is the fact of death. Now then, all these, you see, they conspire
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.640]   together to fill men with a sense of fear, the spirit of fear. And yet, you know, I haven't
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.560]   given the main and ultimate explanation of this spirit of fear. Do you know what it is?
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.080]   Well, I'll tell you, it's all there in Genesis 3. The real reason why man is fearful
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   as the result of these factors is that he was made to be dependent upon God. He was
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.600]   placed in this bath, endless cosmos. Yes, but he was not put alone in it. It wasn't
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.800]   like lending a child on a doorstep, or as I say, putting a man out in the mid-Atlantic
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.120]   and leaving him alone in his little frail bark. No, no, man was not alone. He was made
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.600]   for God, by God, and in communion with God, in fellowship with God. He was in this expanding,
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.880]   endless universe, but in touch with the Maker and Creator. He was made, I say, in such a
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:19.080]   way that he was to be dependent upon God. And the whole trouble with men in sin, the
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.920]   whole trouble with modern men is this, that he's not big enough for the position into
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:30.560]   which he's put himself. You see, the modern man is like many a man who's lived in this
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:37.760]   world, who's got an inflated notion of his own powers and capacities, and he applies
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   for a job that is too big for him. He's all right in his department. He's all right as
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.480]   a second-in-command, or lower down the line, as long as he's got somebody above him who
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.520]   understands the whole business. He's all right as an executive, as a man who can carry
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.240]   out, but the man's got an inflated notion about himself. Many a young man in business
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.280]   has done this. He is sacked. The older men whom his father had put into the business,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.640]   he says, "I can do all this myself." He puts himself in the chairman's seat, but
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   he's not big enough. And the whole business goes wrong. As we say, he's too big for his
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:19.880]   boots. He's taken a position on that he can't handle, he can't manage, and there he is floundering
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.240]   like the Kaiser of the First World War. He drops the pilot, as it were, and he doesn't
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.880]   know what he's doing. Now, you've known this in life many times, haven't you? A man has
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.280]   got this inflated notion. And you see, this is what men have done. Merner said, "I don't
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:40.400]   need God. I'm capable of understanding and running the cosmos." A modern man is trying
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.480]   to run the cosmos, and he can't, you know. Things keep on going wrong in this department
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.120]   and that department. There's an explosion, there's an accident, there's a death, there's
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.560]   a loss, and men are alarmed and frightened, and the whole machinery's going wrong. He's
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.400]   not big enough. He doesn't look down upon it. He hasn't got the control. He was never
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:07.600]   meant to be in control. God is the controller of the universe. And man is frightened because
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.920]   he is like a man entering into some great machine house, confident that because he'd
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.360]   read a book or two that he'd be able to run the whole machinery. And there he sees levers.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.840]   Which does he pull and which doesn't he pull? And something's happening there, and he can't
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.880]   be here and there and everywhere. And so he's alarmed and terrified, and he's waiting for
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.160]   the final explosion. That's the picture of men in this world since the fall, according
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.680]   to the whole teaching of the Bible. That's the spirit of fear. Man has taken on the universe,
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.080]   and he's not big enough to take it on. He's too big for his shoes. And the result is he's
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   now arrived at the point of crisis, and he doesn't know what he's doing. Very well,
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:51.480]   that leads me to my second principle, which I put in this form. If those are the causes
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:58.560]   of fear, what are the consequences of fear? And now we come, I think, to the very essence
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:05.240]   of the modern problem. This is a very, very relevant section of Scripture, this. What
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:13.080]   are the consequences of the spirit of fear? Well, the first is always weakness. Fear is
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.840]   paralyzing. Haven't you often used the expression, you say, "You know, I was paralyzed by fear"?
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.320]   Fear always brings in this element of paralysis. It does something to you. It knocks you on
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.280]   the head, as it were. It paralyzes your brain, and you feel limp and weak. You're ready
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:36.460]   to collapse, and many do collapse and faint right off. Fear always leads to weakness.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.600]   If you're afraid of an animal, the animal will soon know it. Have you ever been on the
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.080]   back of a horse that you've been afraid of? I can assure you the horse soon realizes it.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:55.360]   He knows your weakness. Fear always leads to weakness and lack of control. And you see,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.040]   the apostle tells Timothy that he's weak. He's behaving in an utterly weak manner.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.600]   He's whimpering and crying. He's sending letters and getting frightened. He doesn't
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.360]   know what to do. Now, that's because he was afraid. If you are afraid, I say again,
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.560]   of a task that's allotted to you, while you are governed by the spirit of fear, you
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.000]   won't be able to do that job. You've got to get rid of that before you can do anything.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.360]   Fear always paralyzes. Secondly, it always leads—and this is an extraordinary thing
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:32.080]   about fear—it always leads to selfishness. The fearful person is always a selfish person,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.040]   because you see, he's afraid of what's going to happen to him, or she's afraid
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.980]   of what's going to happen to her. It leads to an idea of self-protection, self-preservation.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.400]   And that in turn leads to antagonism to others. Fear puts you on the edge. And you're ill
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.240]   at ease, and you're wondering what's going to happen. And in that state, you're touchy.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.680]   And if somebody makes a noise, and they're always making noises, and so they irritate
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.820]   you. And here you are, and you blame them, and you're always in trouble. You're filled
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.560]   with this irritability, which is always an outcome of selfishness.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:07.680]   Now, you know, fear does this invariably. You look at a child suffering from fear, and
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.200]   it'll become peevish. It'll become difficult to handle. The child can't help it. And
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.520]   often, you see, mistakes are made even in medical diagnosis along this very line. There
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.440]   are people who come with this symptom or that, but their real trouble is they're afraid
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:25.800]   of something. And fear can show itself in almost an endless variety of ways, both physical,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.680]   mental, moral, spiritual, and everything else. Weakness, selfishness, and then of course,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:38.240]   inevitably, unhappiness and misery. You can't be at one and the same time fearful and happy.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.640]   So you see, the very spirit of fear is a great cause of the unhappiness that's in the world.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   But the thing I wanted to emphasize above everything else at this point is this, that
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:56.960]   fear always leads to irrationality. What do I mean by that? Well, this. Fear does rarely
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:03.400]   paralyze, and it paralyzes the brain above everything else. And because it paralyzes
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:11.480]   the brain, the brain doesn't function properly. And it leads to acting in an utterly irrational
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:18.320]   manner. In other words, there is nothing that makes people behave with such irresponsibility
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.920]   as the spirit of fear. Always has done. You watch people in a condition of fear. They
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:29.240]   will do the most amazing and extraordinary things, and they don't know why they're
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.440]   doing them. Why? Well, because their fear has made them irrational. And of course, it
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.880]   leads in the same way to escapism. Now, I said that I wanted to be very practical tonight
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.560]   and to show you the relevance of what the Apostle is saying to the conditions in this
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:51.280]   world at this very moment. How is the spirit of fear manifesting itself in this present
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:34:00.080]   generation? Well, the most obvious manifestation is the pleasure mania. Why is everybody plunging
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   into pleasure? There's only one answer. It's a part of the escape mechanism. It's
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:11.360]   the fear of life. I think I've quoted this here before, but this is a sheer fact of history.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.240]   I remember it very well in this very chapel. At the beginning of the last war—you remember
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:24.920]   when the blackout regulations were brought in?—immediately on the outbreak of war,
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:33.840]   all theatres, all cinemas and places of amusement were shut by order of the government. Do you
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.760]   remember what happened? I've never forgotten this, because it was such a proof of what
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:44.840]   the Bible says. There was a constant stream of protests in the newspapers, and in every
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:51.680]   other way conceivable, urging upon the authorities to open the cinemas again, and the theatres,
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:57.840]   and the places of amusement. Why? Well, because people had discovered—and it was a very
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:03.160]   good bit of psychological observation—people discovered that if men and women were going
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:08.280]   to be kept at home every night without having the release of the cinema and the theatre
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.920]   and the other places of amusement, that they wouldn't be able to take the strain of war.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:18.280]   They couldn't stand up to it. So the theatres and the cinemas, etc., were opened, if I remember
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.520]   rightly, after three or four nights of being shut. There was a public outcry, a public
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.480]   demand for the opening of these things. Why? Escapism. It's a terrible thing to the modern
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.720]   man to be compelled to sit in his own house, you know, for a week at a time, and just think
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.680]   and face life and the facts of life and the possibilities. He can't do it. So he escapes
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:46.840]   via pleasure in its various forms. And, of course, the same thing happens with drink.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.920]   Even when there's a war, and when the ships are being sunk, and when the whole question
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:56.800]   of feeding this nation may arise, there are very little restrictions on drink. Why? Well,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.080]   the statesmen know perfectly well you couldn't have kept this country going without drink.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:08.120]   The morale of the country would collapse without drink. Now that's all, you see, one of the
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.240]   manifestations of the spirit of fear. And then, of course, we've got it today in the
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:19.160]   form of drugs. Purple hearts, so-called, pep pills, stimulants. Why do people need them?
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.360]   What's the matter? It's all because they're afraid. My dear friends, don't misunderstand
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.000]   me. I'm not here to condemn men and women. I'm sorry for them. I'm a preacher of the
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.920]   gospel because I'm sorry for people who can't go on without drugs and drinks and pleasure
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.280]   and all these things. And, of course, we are seeing even more today. We are seeing outbreaks
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:46.200]   of hysteria, mass hysteria. I'm sorry for the young people of today with this sense
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   of finitude, with this sense of utter purposelessness, with these atomic and hydrogen bombs in the
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.520]   background. They're really terrified. They're afraid of life. So what do they do? Well,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.280]   they must let go somehow. And so they become hysterical. And you get the hysteria of these
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.120]   poor Beatles and their followers and the moths and the rockers. Don't laugh at them, my dear
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.680]   friends. You ought to weep for them. You should weep for them. This is hysteria. This is a
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:23.560]   disease. This is the spirit of fear. And it leads to utter irrationality. Life has lost
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.680]   any meaning or purpose for such people. And this is how it's showing itself. It's an explosion
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   of men in the grip of the spirit of fear. He's no answer. He's no solution at all. Now then,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:41.240]   there, according to the biblical teaching, you see, is what all this spirit of fear leads
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:47.280]   to. And ultimately it leads, in many cases, to despair. It leads many to suicide. They
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.200]   can't stand up to it any longer. They just say, "I can't. I must go out." And out they
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.880]   go. It's all the result of the spirit of fear. Man in the grip of the spirit of fear becomes
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.240]   irrational. He becomes irresponsible. When a man is in the spirit of fear, be ready for
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.120]   him to do anything that's conceived. He'll do any kind of madness. He doesn't know what
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:12.520]   he's doing. And I believe that this generation to which you and I belong, and these immediate
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:18.240]   present days in particular, are giving us the most perfect demonstration of the truth
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.200]   of the biblical teaching that perhaps the world has ever known. We are seeing the spirit
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.920]   of fear in this manifestation of utter irrationality. I'm not here to blame these poor people. I'm
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.280]   here to tell them that there's only one cure for it all. There's only one answer to it
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.840]   all. What is it? What have I got to say to a world in fear tonight that's paralyzed and
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.960]   irrational and behaving as it is? I'm here to say this. There's only one answer. What
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:54.640]   is it? It isn't pull yourself together. There is nothing more idiotic to say to a poor person
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.720]   who's in the grip of the spirit of fear than pull yourself together. That's the one thing
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:05.120]   he can't do. If he could, he would. And yet that's what the world says. Not the clever
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:10.040]   world, but the stupid world, which believes in a sort of muscular outlook upon life. Pull
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.680]   yourself together. You can't say that to a person who's suffering from melancholia
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.200]   or hysteria or one of these things. They can't. They're beyond that. They're in the grip of
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:25.560]   it. They're irrational. And there's no use addressing an appeal to the rational element
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:31.440]   of a person who is irrational. That, incidentally, for the sake of you philosophers, is the whole
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:37.320]   weakness in the entire position of Bertrand Russell. He says man's irrational, and then
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.760]   he appeals to his rationality. And that's why he's finally such a profound pessimist
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.400]   about the whole future of the human race. You can't have it both ways, yet that's what
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.120]   he does. Well, now I say it isn't just an appeal to pull ourselves together. Neither
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:59.520]   is it, oh, the teaching of the cults, you know, positive thinking. The power of positive
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.060]   thinking. Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm not here to say that the cults and psychology
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.960]   and all these things don't help people up to a point, but you see, they don't really
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:15.320]   help fundamentally. They only drug us for the time being. It's Christian science. It
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.480]   tells you that there's no such thing as matter, and because there's no such thing as matter,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.320]   there can't be such a thing as a disease. And therefore, when you think you're ill,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.840]   you're not. And what you've got to do is to say that you're not, because you can't be.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:35.120]   All right, my dear friends, but you see, it leads Mrs. Baker, Eddie, at the end of her
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:42.040]   life to take morphia and to use spectacles. It's all right in theory. And of course, it'll
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.320]   cover a lot of aches and pains. Christian science and all the cults are quite good in
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.440]   dealing with many functional diseases, as they're called. Things which are not organic,
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.280]   but when you come to the organic, of course, they do nothing. The patient dies, as I say,
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:03.160]   Mrs. Baker, Eddie herself, sent for a doctor, took morphia and to use spectacles. A blank
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.840]   contradiction of all her teaching. Ah, yes, yes, you see, these things are all right up
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.280]   to a point, but they don't deal with the fundamental questions, and we are looking at them. It
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:19.680]   isn't, then, some cult or psychology or coercion or some general optimistic idealistic philosophy,
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.280]   because the two world wars have really knocked the bottom out of all those. And it's because
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.600]   if they've done so, that we're getting this terrible hysterical reaction, I think, out
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.000]   of this present generation. It isn't that. What is it? Well, says Paul
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.600]   God hath not given us none of those things. What has he given us? He's given us the Holy
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:47.360]   Spirit. God has given us the Spirit. And he isn't the Spirit of fear, but he's the Spirit
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:52.400]   of power and of love and of a sound mind. You notice the apostle keeps on saying this.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.160]   He says, look here, stir up the gift that is in thee, which is in thee by the putting
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:02.600]   on of my hands that good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:10.000]   in us. Here's Christianity. It isn't only forgiveness, it isn't only rebirth, it goes
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.920]   beyond all that even. It tells us that God puts the Holy Spirit into us, that the Spirit
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.720]   dwells in us. If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. The Christian
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.600]   is enabled in all respects by the Spirit that dwells in him. I think this is the most wonderful
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.720]   thing of all. You see, we are not left to ourselves. What this Gospel does is to bring
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:38.040]   us back, if you like, into the relationship which we once had with the general manager.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.520]   We are no longer the heads of the universe, but we are back in our rightful positions,
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.160]   and he is in control, and he tells us what to do, he gives us authority, he gives us
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.640]   power, and he does it all through giving us his Spirit. In other words, this is the glory
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:59.080]   of this message, that a man is not left to himself, but he is given the Spirit of the
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:06.160]   living God. God hath given us not the Spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:13.440]   sound mind. But notice this. The Holy Spirit is not something that operates in us automatically.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.720]   There are people who believe that, you see, and they turn Christianity into a cult. You
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.120]   get it in a meeting, and you have always got it. No, no, it is not true. Timothy, you see,
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:28.560]   has to be told this. "I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift." There is man's
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.720]   side in this. It is not passive. It is not something done for us. Man has got to stir
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.480]   up the gift that is in him. He has given the gift of the Spirit, but he must realize that
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.920]   and obey the leading of the Spirit and go on in the strength and the power of the Spirit.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.400]   And as he does so, what happens to him? Well, you see, he is given the very antidote to
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:57.480]   everything that results from fear. God hath not given us the Spirit of fear. What then?
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:07.960]   Power. God's power. God's power working in us and enabling us. "Work out your own
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.480]   salvation with fear and trembling." Why? Well, it is God that worketh in you both the
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.360]   will and to do of his good pleasure. I say, you are not left alone to battle with the
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.560]   world and the flesh and the devil. We could not do it, but God's Spirit comes within
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.040]   us and he is a Spirit of power. He can keep us. He can enable us. He works in us. He transforms
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   us and everything that is round and about us. This is the great hope of the Christian,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.440]   that he is not left to himself. The apostle works this out in a most wonderful manner
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.080]   in the eighth chapter of his epistle to the Romans. Listen to this. "What shall we say
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:52.920]   then to these things?" And here is his answer. "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:58.960]   Who can be against us? If God be for us, and he is for us if we believe in Christ, and
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:05.800]   he puts his Spirit into us, if God be for us, who can be against us? "He that spared
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.240]   not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.440]   give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.480]   justifies, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.840]   again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us." Listen.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:34.920]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? There is the challenge. Listen. "Shall tribulation
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:42.200]   or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword, as it is written, 'For
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.440]   thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep to the slaughter'?
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:59.760]   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:07.080]   I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:12.200]   things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:20.000]   able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Neither life
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.880]   nor meal nor prison nor death nor anything, nothing." Why? Well, because it is the power
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:35.520]   of God. Did you notice that first hymn we sang? "His power subdues our sin and his
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:42.920]   forgiving love far as the east is from the west doth all our sins remove." Listen to
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:52.560]   another. "He breaks the power of cancelled sin. He sets the prisoners free. 'If the
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:47:00.640]   Son shall make you free,' says our Lord himself, 'you shall be free indeed.' I need
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:06.600]   thee every hour, says another, 'stay thou nearby.' Why? Well, temptations lose their
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:16.360]   power when thou art nigh. 'Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,' says another saint, 'pilgrim
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:26.760]   through this barren land. I am weak, but thou art mighty. Hold me with thy powerful hand,
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:35.840]   bread of heaven. Feed me till my want is all. When I tread the verge of Jordan, bid my anxious
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:46.880]   fears subside, death of deaths and hell's destruction. Land me safe on Canaan's side.'
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:54.240]   Songs of praises I will ever give to thee." Or take that great hymn which we sang just
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:59.600]   now, the hymn of George Matheson. What a perfect statement it is of all this. "Make me a
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   captive Lord and then I shall be free. I've tried to be the general manager of the universe
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.920]   and I'm alarmed, I'm frightened, I'm terrified. Put me back in the office as the office boy.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.240]   As long as I know that you're in the main office, all is well. Make me a captive Lord
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:22.600]   and then I shall be free. I can then do what I was meant to do, as long as I know that
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:30.760]   you are at the controls. Force me to render up my sword and I shall conquer thee. I sink
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:37.840]   in life's alarms while by myself I stand. Imprison me within thine arms and strong shall
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:45.640]   be my hand. My heart is weak and poor until it must find. It has no spring of action,
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:52.120]   sure, it where there is with the wind. It cannot freely move till thou hast wrought
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:59.520]   its chain. Enslave it with thy matchless love and deathless it shall reign. My will is not
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.680]   my own until I make it thine, till thou hast made it thine. If it would reach a monarch's
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.080]   throne, and that's where we all want to be, isn't it? But we can't put ourselves there.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.800]   The whole of civilization has been trying to put itself on a monarch's throne and it
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:20.240]   realizes it's a buffoon. If thou, if it would reach a monarch's throne, it must its crown
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.400]   resign, its own self-made tawdry crown. It must throw it to the scrap heap of eternity
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.280]   and receive the crown of righteousness that the Lord alone can give. It only stands unbent
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:42.000]   amidst the clashing strife when on thy bosom it is lent and found in thee its life. My
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:50.240]   dear friend, you are offered here a spirit of power, the power of God taking hold of
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:57.440]   you, surrounding you, enabling you, ever with you. Never leave thee nor forsake thee. I
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.640]   cannot, therefore, what men may say or do unto me. God has said, I will never leave
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:08.520]   thee nor forsake thee. Imprison me with thy strong hand. That's it, imprison me within
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:21.520]   thine arms and strong shall be my hand. Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free,
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.560]   the spirit of power and of love. Oh, how it answers all the things that are produced by
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:33.520]   the spirit of fear. I needn't keep you, but I told you that fear always makes us selfish.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   It makes us irritable. It makes us difficult to live with. A fear-frightened person is
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.560]   an object of compassion. He feels everything. The whole world, the universe is against him.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.480]   And so he hates it in turn. And so he is unhappy and makes others unhappy. But you see, here
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:55.520]   we are given a spirit of love. And you know what it is. You remember how our Lord put
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:03.520]   it in the Sermon on the Mount? You have heard that it was said by them of old time, "Do
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:10.520]   good to them that love you," and so on. "Be kind to those who are kind to you. Love those
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:16.520]   who love you." You remember that was the teaching. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:23.520]   enemies. But I say unto you, love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do good to them
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   that hate you. And pray for them which use you despitefully and persecute you, that you
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.520]   may be children of your Father which is in heaven. For he maketh his Son to rise on the
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. If you love them
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   that love you, what reward of you? Do not even the publicans the same? And if you salute
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:56.520]   liked even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. It is indeed a spirit of love,
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   enables a man to love his enemies, delivers him from fear and all the irritability and
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.520]   all the enmity created by that. It makes you feel sorry for them. It makes you feel sorry
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:12.520]   even for your enemies and those who malign you and persecute you. You remember what our
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   blessed Lord said on the cross on Calvary's hill? He said, "Father, forgive them. They
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   know not what they do." He was not frightened. And because he was not frightened he did not
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.520]   hate the people who were responsible for his crucifixion. He was calm, he was the Son of
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.520]   God. He knew he was in the hands of the Eternal and he was calm and he looks on and he says,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   "Father, forgive these people who have done this to me." They do not know what they do.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.520]   That is the spirit of love. Is it possible in a man? Yes, but only when he is filled
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.520]   with the Holy Spirit. There is a glorious example of this in the book of Acts, a man
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   called Stephen. We are told of Stephen in the sixth chapter of Acts, that he was filled
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   with the Holy Spirit and this is how he showed it. Cruel men stoned him to death for nothing.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:09.520]   The Pharisees and Sadducees and religious authorities, they literally stoned him to
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.520]   death and you know with what words he died. These were the words upon his dying lips,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge." Why? Well, he was not afraid, you see. Stephen
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   was the only man on that occasion who was not afraid. These other people, they had felt
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.520]   something of the power of the gospel. They had seen his face shining as he was addressing
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.520]   the conference. They felt the power of the Spirit and they were terrified. And like men
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.520]   like that they always acted irrationally. They murdered him. They were terrified. But
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:47.520]   the man who was being stoned to death was perfectly at peace. He is sorry for them.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:54.520]   He is praying for them and he says, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge." He had
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:00.520]   got the Spirit of love as well as the Spirit of power. And lastly, sound mind, discipline,
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   and oh, this is wonderful, self-control. When the Holy Spirit is in us and operating in
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   us, whatever may happen to us, we don't just react violently. We don't lose our heads
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   and panic and lose control and say, "What's happening? Is God a God of love? Why is this
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   happening to me?" And the end of the world has come and rush frantically and do the irrational
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   things. No, no. The man who has the Spirit of God operating in him is not only made strong,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   he is not only made loving, he is made rational. The only man who rarely can understand the
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:44.520]   history of the world is a Christian. They don't understand the modern world. I was referring
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.520]   to this this morning. You must have read in your papers. They are now going to set up
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   a committee to inquire into this new outbreak of violence. Clacton and Marget and Brighton,
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.520]   they are going to set up a committee to look into it. Why? Well, because they don't understand.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.520]   They don't understand why people are behaving like this. And you see, it's only the Holy
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   Spirit who can give us the explanation. Man, apart from God, will always act like that
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:22.520]   in some shape or form. He's always been doing it. The manifestations vary, but the thing
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.520]   principle is always the same. And you see, the Spirit gives us discipline, a sound mind,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:33.520]   self-control. Why? Well, because we understand what's happening. I put it like this to you.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:40.520]   What the Apostle is really saying to Timothy is this. "Timothy, did you ever really imagine
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:45.520]   that the whole world would be delighted to hear my preaching? Are you really surprised
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   that they've put me into prison and that they're threatening to put me to death? Are you surprised
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:54.520]   that Timothy, where's your understanding, man? You are reacting to events. Why don't
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   you look down upon them? Why don't you have the mind of Christ in operation? Why don't
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:04.520]   you see that man in sin is in a sense bound to do this? This is foolishness to him. This
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.520]   is blindness. This is something against him as he thinks. He thinks God's against him.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.520]   He thought the Son of God was against him. He's only behaving irrationally. Look down
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:21.520]   upon it, men, and you won't be surprised. See through it all. Let the Spirit lead you
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:28.520]   to understand it all. The Spirit of God not only enables us to understand it and to see
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   through it, it enables us, thank God, to see beyond it. And that, God willing, is the thing
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   I'm hoping to direct your attention to next Sunday night. I am not ashamed. Why not? Well,
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   I know him in whom I have believed. And I am persuaded that he is able to keep that
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:04.520]   which I have committed unto him against that day. And a man who's had a glimpse of that
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:11.520]   day is never again afraid of anything that can happen to him in this present, passing,
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:20.520]   evil world. My dear friends, is the Spirit of God in you? What is the Spirit that is
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.520]   dominating your life tonight? It's a very practical thing, this. I'm not preaching theoretically
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:33.520]   from this pulpit, thank God. What's the Spirit dominating in you? Are you afraid? Are you
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:40.520]   terrified by your finitude, by the uncertainty, by the seen, by the unseen, the knowable and
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:54.520]   the unknowable? Or have you got the Spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind?
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   If you haven't got it, all you need to do tonight is to come to God just as you are.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   Admit and confess your folly and your failure. Believe his message concerning his Son, Jesus
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.520]   Christ, the Savior, who has been manifested, who has abolished death and brought life and
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:24.520]   immortality to light through his gospel. Believe on him as the Son of God, who died for your
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:29.520]   sins to reconcile you to God and to make you a child of God and an heir of heaven. Commit
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:39.520]   yourself to him and he'll put his Spirit into you. And his Spirit is a Spirit of power and
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:51.520]   of love and of sound mind. And he will deliver you from the spirit of fear and all the irrationality
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:59.520]   that always results from fear. Beloved people, don't give yourself rest or peace until you
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:06.520]   get to know him, this blessed Son of God. He's gone through it all. He's conquered everything.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.520]   He's opened the way even into the glory of eternity. Get to know him so then whatever
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:18.520]   happens to you, you'll be able to say, "Nevertheless, I am not ashamed for I know him in whom I
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   have believed. And I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   him against that day." Amen.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
