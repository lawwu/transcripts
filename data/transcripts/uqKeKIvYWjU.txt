[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.500]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Our inbox is always full of questions about personal
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.280]   finance, taxes, investing. Duncan, we've got our first one on leveraged ETFs in a while
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.480]   today. We're going to talk about it on the show. Remember, email AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.280]   We're sponsored today by Future Proof. Future Proof Festival, September 10th through 13th,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.320]   I think it is. Yep, I nailed it. Huntington Beach, California. A bunch of us from the
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.200]   firm were in Chicago this weekend, in our Chicago office, and we were talking about
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.880]   some things we're going to be doing differently at Future Proof. Last year was kind of the
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.440]   initial thing. We had fun, we figured it out, but we were still just kind of testing the
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.920]   waters a little bit. Now that we know what we're doing, it's going to be even more fun.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.580]   It's going to be great. I have an important question. The people want to know what movie
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.160]   scene are you guys going to reenact? I know I think I asked this on a previous one, but
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.080]   have you thought about it? I don't know if we can top Rocky III. What's another good
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.360]   beach one? Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to think. All right. We'll think about it. We'll
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000]   come up with something. All right. Let's do a question. Okay. Up first today we have a
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.640]   wedding question. So first off, congrats. I'm getting married in July and we're spending
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.360]   about $50,000 on a 150 person wedding. We booked our honeymoon in Cabo at an all-inclusive
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.800]   resort for $7,200. I'm very excited for this trip and I know that it's going to be the
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.440]   time of my life and one of the happiest things I do along with the wedding. We're in great
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.800]   financial shape and they give details and I would say very great financial shape, but
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.000]   this just seems like a huge amount of money for a trip. How do you guys go about planning,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960]   budgeting, and following through on big purchases? Yeah, we're talking I think someone in their
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   late twenties, six-figure income combined with their new spouse, no debt, paid off student
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   loans, no credit card debt, maxing out their 401k and IRAs, and setting aside money for
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.960]   a house in a taxable account. So for someone in their twenties, they are beyond prepared
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.560]   financially. The problem is there's plenty of personal finance experts out there who
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.080]   teach you how to save money, but no one actually teaches you how to spend money. That's not
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.980]   a thing anyone ever talks about, right? It's really easy to chastise someone for spending
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.020]   too much and going crazy with their credit card. Not many people spend the time to figure
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.860]   out what should you spend your money on to make you happy. And I do say now not all spending
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.960]   is bad, right? If all you do is save money but don't enjoy it now, what's the point?
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.720]   I think you have to strike some sort of balance between I'm going to delay gratification for
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.640]   future me, but I'm also going to enjoy in the present a little bit, too. You have to
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.720]   have some balance here. Obviously, for some people, it's the opposite problem. All they
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   do is spend, right? But we have plenty of people like this who have that mentality of
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   a saver, and that was me for the longest time. I think a lot of it, there's two parts for
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.240]   your financial habits. Part of it is the environment you grew up in, the habits you learned from
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.320]   your family or parents or friends or whatever it is, and then I think part of it is personality
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.680]   driven. I think I was just born to be a saver. I've always been a saver. So in the twenties,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.700]   I was in a similar situation, minus the six-figure income this person has. I had to teach myself
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.580]   how to spend a little bit, right? So I think the important thing is this person is going
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.160]   to be fine. They're already maxing out their 401(k) in their twenties. Regardless, you should
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   have some fun. So I do have one comment on the wedding thing first. I know a lot of people
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.040]   will, especially after you are a few years away from it and you're financially inclined,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.560]   you look back and you say, "God, what a ridiculous way to spend your money. Why would you spend
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.120]   that much money for one single day in your life? It doesn't make any sense." The economists
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   will say, "Why would you spend X thousands of dollars on a dress you're going to wear
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.240]   once and put it in your storage closet? What if we invested that money instead?" I get
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   that mentality. But looking back on my wedding, now that I'm far enough away from it, I think,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.200]   let's see, 2007, so we're getting close to... It's been a while. Closing on 20 years there.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.800]   It's the only time in my entire life that everyone who mattered to me in my life was
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.680]   there on the same day. All my friends, all my family, high school friends, college friends,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.040]   childhood friends, family from both sides of the family, wife's friends, everyone was
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.080]   in one place at the same time. That's never going to happen again. Is that the worst that
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.400]   kind of investment? I think so. Plus, it was a good party, too, right? My wife and I actually
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.000]   did Cabo for our honeymoon as well. I don't think it cost that much, but not a bad place.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.680]   Here's what I would do to get over this hump and get out of that Saber mentality. I just
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.520]   want you to start off by picking one category that you're going to use as your spending
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.680]   thing. Your one place for safe spending. It's a safe place for spending. You're not going
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.640]   to be judged. It could be travel. For some people, it might be health and fitness, experiences,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.520]   going out to dinner or drinks with friends, something like that. Give yourself a break
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.680]   in that just one specific category. You can set a dollar amount within reason, but I'd
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.760]   say don't question it. My first category was books. I think I mentioned before, when I
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.400]   first came out of college, I knew next to nothing besides reading a few textbooks, so
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.800]   I had to play catch up. I was doing a ton of reading. I would go to the library, because
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.760]   I was a frugal guy, but all these books would be on back order that people would have already
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.000]   signed up for. I'd wait weeks or sometimes months for a book. Finally, I said, "Screw
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.400]   this. I'm just going to buy the book." For me now, I bought a Kindle, and I never questioned
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.840]   buying books. If I see a book I want to buy, I'm going to buy it. If it looks interesting,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.140]   I'm going to buy it. Granted, some of them sit on my Kindle forever and don't get read,
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.960]   but to me, that's a spending category that I'm okay with. I'm not going to question it,
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.720]   because that's something that I like spending money on. The way I view it is, you have to
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.400]   be selectively cheap. Unless you make obscene amounts of money and you just don't care,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.520]   you're going to have to cut back in certain places and spend in other places. You have
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.680]   to prioritize. Here's my line of thinking on some of this. We like having a nice house,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.160]   but we filled it with relatively inexpensive furniture. Why? Because kids destroy furniture.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.000]   So, we don't want to spend a lot on that. I do like paying for time and convenience.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.640]   Lawn care, snow plow, house cleaning, that sort of stuff. I'm perfectly fine paying for
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.800]   time. I don't drive luxury vehicles. My wife and I aren't big fans of fancy restaurants.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   No expensive hobbies, like skiing or golf for me. If that's your thing, that's fine,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.680]   but for me, it's too much of a time and money suck. I know that I only have a finite amount
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   of time with my kids before they're out of the house and doing their own thing and not
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.600]   wanting to hang out with me anymore. So, my wife and I prioritize spending on experiences
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.040]   with the kids. Not to brag, I like spending money on clothes a little bit. I'm not going
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.400]   to apologize for that, but I couldn't tell you the last thing I bought that wasn't on
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.800]   sale. This sweatshirt here, pretty new one, sweater. Bought it on sale.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   Is that marine wear?
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   That's probably J. Crew.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   Okay.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.520]   Yeah, I do get a lot of questions from people about my fashion choices. Maybe I should start
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   my own little fashion.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.120]   Honestly, yeah. I think you're setting the fashion trend for the compound.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.320]   Yeah. So, I think the big thing is just prioritizing the thing you care about and then just being
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.200]   fine cutting back everywhere else. But you have to find those categories that you enjoy
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.960]   and then double down on them. So, I think start with one. Get one category, travel,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.540]   experiences, going out, whatever it is. And I think this is definitely a psychological
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.800]   hangup for some people, but I think knowing that you have that savings taking place already,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   then you're fine and you don't worry about the other stuff. It's kind of guilt-free spending
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.460]   once you have the savings taken care of. And this person obviously has that. Duncan, what's
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.460]   something you like spending money on?
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.360]   I was just saying, yeah, I was saying in the chat kind of the same thing. I've never regretted
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.840]   spending money on traveling. I've gotten to go to quite a few countries in Europe and
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.520]   I've never been like, "Oh, wow, that wasn't worth it." And including when I was younger,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.960]   I probably took out an irresponsible amount of debt on a credit card to travel and go
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.000]   on a trip to Hungary and some other countries.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.280]   My wife and I said that too. Before we were going to have kids, we said, "Let's travel."
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.880]   So we had one thing where a friend got married in Connecticut and we went for like 36 hours.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.640]   We flew in, hotel, partied with friends, flew back out. And the amount of money we spent,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.360]   we spent like a couple thousand dollars probably. And it seemed ridiculous at the time, but
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.600]   we got to hang out with all of our friends for that one weekend. And it's like without
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.080]   kids, no responsibilities, it was worth it. So yeah, so I think finding some of those
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.720]   places where, yeah, you know you're not going to regret it in the future. But I do agree
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   for traveling to big ones.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   Apparently it's $86 tequila drinks, you know, so teach their own.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   You only live once.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.480]   That's a reference to Animal Spirits for those of you that haven't listened yet.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.120]   Okay. Up next today, we have a question from Brent. "Piggybacking on the Roth IRA conversation
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.640]   from last week, what are your thoughts on buying and holding a leveraged ETF and a Roth
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.880]   IRA? For example, I'm 34 years old and plan to retire at 65. Would a leveraged ETF and
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   my Roth IRA likely lead to better long-term returns? I'm a very disciplined investor and
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.840]   do not make changes in my accounts. I've held SPY and only SPY since I opened the account
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.560]   12 years ago. Thanks for all you do."
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.600]   All right, first one of these in a while, right? A lot of bond questions lately, but
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.480]   finally got a leveraged one. So this fund that they ask about, it seeks to two times
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.440]   the daily performance of the S&P 500. Some of these leveraged ETFs will kind of chop
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.680]   you up because they reset on daily basis. They're trying to get double the daily return.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.200]   So sometimes it doesn't work out exactly what you'd think, but I looked at this one. This
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.680]   one is actually not too bad. So John, pull up the chart here. This is SSO versus SPY.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.080]   These are the annual returns by year. This actually goes back to 2006. And you can see
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.560]   it's not exactly two times, but it's pretty darn close. The down years are really bad.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.520]   The up years are really good. The highs are higher and the lows are lower, right? So this
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.640]   thing actually does an okay job doing this. This is ridiculously volatile, obviously.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.520]   So let's do one more chart here. This is the drawdown profile. Now, this goes back to 2006.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:07.960]   We pick up the 2008. And the 2008 crash, from 2007 to early 2009, the S&P was down 56%,
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.600]   I want to say. This thing was down almost 86%. And the difference between a 56% return
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.040]   and an 86% return is not 30%. It's way, way bigger. This is depression-level kind of stuff
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.920]   here, right? Even during the COVID crash, this fund was down 60%. When the S&P was down
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   a little more than 30. The depths of the current bear market was down almost 50%. So these
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.200]   things get crushed. I know you said you're disciplined, you can hold on to the S&P, that's
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.320]   fine. I just wanted to point this stuff out there. So I don't really think the placement
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.920]   of a fund like this matters nearly as much as your ability to hold on for dear life.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.760]   However, let's say that you want to use this as a carve-out piece for your speculation
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.640]   bucket, and you're going to keep the majority of your holdings in other stocks or bonds
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.560]   or whatever, and you have a small piece in this, 10%, 15%, 20%. You say, "I'm going to
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.600]   speculate with this, and I'm going to rebalance it occasionally, because I want to take advantage
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.000]   of this volatility. When it's up a lot, I want to rebalance out of it. When it's down
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.040]   a lot, I want to rebalance into the pain." That may be a rough make sense, if you're
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   going to be doing some rebalancing and taking advantage of that volatility. But I think
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.440]   the placement of this one probably doesn't matter nearly as much as your ability to hold
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.400]   on for dear life. I guess if you think that you're going to be holding on and getting
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.080]   big gains over time, and the stock market continues to go up, yeah, Roth would make
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.960]   sense. But yeah, I think it depends how you utilize it.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.440]   I have to be honest. This one hits home for me, because I started to buy into all the
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.360]   questions we were getting back a couple years ago. Why wouldn't everything just be triple
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.280]   levered? The market is still going up, and look at this past performance. I've gotten
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.680]   kind of torn up on the triple levered cues.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.080]   Okay, triple levered. So, it's down, what, probably 80%, 70%?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.840]   I think I was top-ticking it, basically. I've averaged into it, but it's been a rough position.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.120]   And you're going to hold on to it?
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.640]   The thing is, when it comes back, the gains will be good, but that's the thing.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.920]   It's only got, what, like a 1.2% fee or something?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.960]   You're paying for that leverage, I guess.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.060]   Yeah, it's rough.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.080]   It's tough. I mean, the good thing is, I guess in a fund like this, you're not going to get
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.440]   like a traditional margin call or something. So, I get it. I would say just position size
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.960]   correctly, because this thing will rip your face off.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.160]   Yeah. And yeah, stocks go down. Who knew?
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.400]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.560]   Okay, question three from Charles. "As a retail investor, how does one go about assessing
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.400]   the investment performance of a security or index fund beyond looking at the historic
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.720]   performance, which Ben Carlson recently described as chasing performance? On this note, can
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.140]   you please explain a backtest in simple terms? What is a good way for an average investor
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.160]   to do a backtest?" This one, I don't really understand the backtest thing, not being a
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.200]   finance person. It sounds really cool, though.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.240]   Well, the idea is, there's a few different ways to look at a backtest. A backtest could
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.400]   be you look at some sort of stock picking strategy. I'm going to pick only stocks with
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.880]   this type of P/E ratio or this type of momentum, or whatever the case may be. You put it into
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.760]   a backtest, you say, "I'm going to do the top 30 holdings," or whatever, and then you
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.600]   run it, and then it looks amazing. The problem is that you can torture the data to say anything
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.680]   you want it to say in a backtest. So, I'm not sure what performance chasing comment they're
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.080]   talking about here. I do like to use my full name here. You know the only time people really
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   use full names is in rom-coms. If it's a Matthew McConaughey movie, whatever his name is, they'll
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.040]   say the full name. No one ever says your full name first and last in real life, right? It's
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.280]   only in movies or TV shows.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.640]   Or when you're in trouble.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.180]   Yes. I do agree that making an investment decision is based on short-term outperformance
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.720]   tend to lead to disastrous outcomes for investors. It's not just individual investors. This is
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.280]   not just retail. Institutional investors as well. John, throw this up there. This is from
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:02.800]   my Organizational Alpha book. A team of researchers looked at the outperformance one, two, and
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.720]   three years before these pensions and endowments and billion-dollar funds decided to hire a
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.040]   manager, and then what happened after they hired them. So, the one, two, three years
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.680]   before, they were performing like crazy, right? And then the one, two, three years afterwards,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.800]   of course, they underperformed. So, you know, you make your decision based on short-term
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   performance, probably not going to work out too well. Same thing with individuals.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.200]   The good news is that individual investors have never had better access to backtesting
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.080]   tools, right? Most of them for free. I've always enjoyed Portfolio Visualizer. It's
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.920]   a pretty good one if you want to do mutual funds, ETFs, individual stocks. You can do
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.080]   a backtest and look at the performance and the drawdown profile and all that stuff. I
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.640]   do have a lot of thoughts on backtests, because I've performed many of them in my career.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.000]   So, I think we need to Charlie Munger this thing and invert it. So, not looking at what
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.520]   you can get out of a backtest. Here's what you can't get, right? No matter how good it
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.880]   looks on paper. One of the problems is like the data availability and frictions of the
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.840]   past. You can run a backtest back to 1920, but if you were armed with today's level of
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.360]   knowledge and information, you'd probably go back and clean up in the 1920s, right?
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.560]   It's kind of like if you took the seventh best man on an NBA roster and put him back
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.600]   in like the 1940s, they would clean up in the NBA, right? It's the same thing. So, because
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   they knew nothing at the time.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.880]   It's kind of like how LeBron's better than Michael Jordan. Is that what you're saying?
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.920]   Not quite. Well, hey. I was just in Chicago. You can't say it's blasphemous there. Discounted
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.520]   cash flow analysis, I think, was first created in like the 1930s. They didn't know anything
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.280]   back then. So, I think a lot of backtests failed to consider the information people
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.520]   knew at the time, as well as the cost to trade, right? So, you could look at this wonderful
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   backtest of small caps, but realize that half of these stocks didn't trade back in the day,
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.680]   because they were microcaps and they had no liquidity. So, I think backtests can provide
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.760]   context, but you have to think through how realistic it would have been at the time.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.800]   The other thing, a backtest cannot tell you how you would have felt at the time, right?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.160]   The 1987 crash looks like a blip on any long-term stock market chart, but it felt like the second
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   coming of the Great Depression at the time. So, backtests are like extremely unemotional.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   They follow the rules no matter what. Human beings don't always have that same level of
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.200]   self-control, right?
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.560]   Duncan, if you did a backtest of your TQQQ, past you on the spreadsheet is going to hold
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.320]   that thing forever. Present you, when you're 90% drawdown, might say, "I don't know if
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   I can do this anymore."
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.360]   I mean, it's all darkness, right?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.680]   Well, sure. Backtests also don't tell you what the future will look like. I think this
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.800]   is the Michael Batnick line I'm seeing here, but he said there's no such thing as a front
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.200]   test. So, you see all these strategies with these indexes that are created, and there's
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.160]   a wonderful backtest. If you would have just done this, you would have knocked it out of
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.520]   the park. And then, these things go live in an ETF, and they stink. It happens all the
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.360]   time. So, I think it's easy to look at a backtest, and a lot of times, you never know how many
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.080]   different tests and variations they did before they settled on this one strategy. Sometimes,
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.800]   these strategies get arbed away. They may have worked in the past, and they don't work
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:51.160]   anymore. Sometimes, they go away because premiums are there, and then money rushes in, and size
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.600]   is the enemy of all performance. So, I think there's countless strategies that can look
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.320]   good in a backtest, but they put it in an ETF, it stops working magically, and that
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.880]   sort of happens all the time. So, what good is a backtest? I do believe that one of the
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.640]   big traits you need to have as an investor is understanding financial market history.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.880]   I think you have to, if you want to be successful in the long term. Studying the past doesn't
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.320]   really help you predict the future, but I think it can provide context in terms of the
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.920]   relationship between risk and reward. I think that's the big thing. John, throw my other
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.160]   chart up here. I think we've used this one in the past. Stocks, bonds, and cash. Annual
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.040]   returns back to 1928. This shows the average return in the middle there, in blue. High
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.000]   for a year, low for a year. You can see the stock market when you could drive a truck
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.680]   through it, right? Then, it narrows a little for bonds, even narrower for cash. It's not
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.560]   the only reason, but one of the big reasons that the stock market is the best-performing
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.960]   asset class is because of the variance of returns. You should expect a wide range of
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.200]   potential outcomes, especially in the short run. I do think that risk is a lot easier
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.280]   to predict than returns going forward. I think a general understanding of volatility and
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.680]   drawdown profile in the risk of loss is probably the biggest thing historically. I think anyone
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.200]   can create a back test that looks wonderful in terms of past performance. What you need
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.260]   to understand is the risk involved and how reality can differ from the spreadsheet.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:08.620]   Good advice. Sorry, I'm laughing because I just triggered a bunch of people by saying
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.620]   that Shaq was the true GOAT.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.660]   Okay. All right. You spent way too much time online, Duncan. You just know what'll get
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.620]   people. All right, let's do another one.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.700]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Allison. "I know it's frowned upon, but I'm thinking
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.260]   about taking out a 401(k) loan to help with a down payment for my first house. Here's
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.140]   my thought process. My husband and I don't have enough for a big enough down payment
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.660]   to qualify for a loan, so we need the money. It's basically a loan to myself. I understand
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.980]   the problem with pulling money out of the market, but the rates are so high right now,
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.740]   I'm not quite as worried about this. As long as I pay it back in a few years, this should
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.460]   work, right?"
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.740]   Good question. All right. Let's bring on someone who actually has done this both professionally
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.340]   and personally now. Blair Duquene. Blair wrote a great post on this at The Bell Curve.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.340]   Hey, Blair.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   Hey, guys.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.860]   Good to talk to you. Blair, you wrote a great post about a month ago about your personal
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:05.980]   experience with a 401(k) loan. Why don't you tell us some of your experiences with this?
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.420]   I've never done this before. Tell me how this works, and then we can maybe get into some
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.620]   of the nuts and bolts of it. I want to hear your story about why you did this.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.600]   Absolutely. I am a recent convert to the idea of the 401(k) loan. I used to be very anti,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.180]   and I'm anti for the reasons that were mentioned in the question, but I just want to run through
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.420]   them. When you take money out of your 401(k) in a loan, it comes out of the market, which
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.420]   means that money is not growing if the market's going up. In a year like 2022, it would have
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.420]   been a great thing to have taken a loan because the market went down.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.300]   The second thing is you may not be able to continue saving because now you have a new
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.140]   loan payment. It's very important to think about what your cash flow is going to be while
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.380]   the loan is out. Are you still able to contribute at a minimum to get your employer match? I
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.220]   think that that's important.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.940]   The third thing is, and this is the biggest risk of all, is if you leave your company
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.700]   for any reason by your choice or not, that loan is going to become payable in about three
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.340]   months on average. If you can't come up with the cash to pay it back, that's going to be
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.820]   treated as a taxable distribution from your 401(k). That can leave you in a really bad
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.900]   position.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.900]   You thought of all these cons, so what's the pro that talked you into doing this then?
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.660]   What are the benefits here?
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.700]   In my situation, I bought a new home, and it's going to be a few months before I put
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:24.420]   my old home on the market. I'm using this as a bridge loan. The home equity in my current
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.740]   home is a big part of what was going to help me with that very large down payment. In the
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.580]   meantime, I took a 401(k) loan knowing that hopefully in just a few months, I'm going
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.880]   to pay it back.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.380]   Now I'm paying myself back with interest. By the way, it's an 8% interest rate, not
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.620]   a low interest rate, but that money is going back into my 401(k). I'm hoping that I'll
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.860]   still be able to max my 401(k) this year, so I'm going to even be able to put more than
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.420]   the max in my 401(k) if I pay back the interest and still max out my contributions.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.700]   I thought of it as a temporary lending solution. It doesn't count against the debt ratios that
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.620]   the bank used to analyze how much of a mortgage I could qualify for, so that was another benefit.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:09.380]   I think in this questioner's case, the first-time homebuyer, I think it also makes sense. Our
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.780]   colleague Emily Johnson reached out to me and told me she used a 401(k) loan for her
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.260]   first-time home purchase as well. The median home price is getting up close to $400,000.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.940]   Most people have to put 20% down. That's a really large number, $80,000. Most people
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:28.460]   cannot save that in even five or ten years from regular earnings.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:34.060]   Yes, you're paying yourself back if you can do it and also make at least contributions
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.540]   to get your employer's match because that's additional compensation to you that you'd
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:43.100]   be leaving on the table. I think it can be a great option. A home is, for most Americans,
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.300]   the largest part of their net worth. Getting into home ownership, if that's what you want
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.280]   and there's a lot of debate around rent versus buy, but if it's a goal of yours and you're
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.660]   able to make it work from a cash flow basis and a budget basis, I'm actually in favor
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.780]   of it now. I think it can be a great option.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.620]   You said in your post that you're still saving your 401(k). Essentially, this 8% that you're
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.460]   paying back is almost forcing you to increase your savings rate in some way.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:13.460]   It is. It is in a way, yeah. I'm paying back interest and I'm contributing to the 401(k).
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.980]   There are apparently some 401(k)s that won't let you contribute while you're paying back
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.780]   a loan. I think that's unfortunate. The loans can be taken out for a year, three years.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.260]   I think the max is five years. Your payment's going to be higher if you take out a three-year
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:31.220]   loan versus a five-year loan. That's important to think about as well.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.860]   If the budget works out and you're able to pay yourself back that loan over the next
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.620]   three or five years, I really am in favor of using this responsibly. Just know that
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.180]   there is a risk that if you get laid off or decide to change jobs, you're going to need
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.540]   to pay that loan back to avoid paying tax on the distribution.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.300]   Duncan asked us a couple weeks ago if he should slow his 401(k) contributions to save for
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.380]   down payment. Duncan, what do you think about the 401(k) loan as a possibility here to help?
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.580]   That's exactly what I was just thinking. This would be the argument to just keep contributing
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.280]   and then whenever you need it, to pull it from your 401(k), right?
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   It could be one way. In a perfect world, you would have the full down payment in your savings
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.920]   account. That's not reality for most people these days with home prices as high as they
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   are.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.920]   Right.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.920]   Perfect.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.880]   Unless we get a nice big pullback for those of us interested in buying, right?
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   There you go.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   All right.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.800]   Demographics say differently, but maybe not those high prices that we saw in 2021 for
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   sure.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.760]   So this is a great segue to the next question. So Bella writes, "This one's going to trigger
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.320]   some people probably." Oh, no. The firearms going off.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.080]   Uh-oh. Live television.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.600]   Hopefully it's a test. I'm not leaving regardless, but we're only on the 15th floor.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.840]   This is your Wolf of Wall Street moment here.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.280]   Yeah. "I know that y'all advise to take advantage of an employer's 401(k) match. However, what
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.320]   would your rebuttal be to those who say hope is not a strategy and that it's better to
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   have control of what you're invested in? I'm young and I've heard horror stories of those
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.360]   that lost meaningful amounts of their savings during the last downturn. I understand that
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.040]   the market tends to go up over time, but I do worry that in the future I won't be able
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.960]   to retire when I want to because of the way the market is behaving at that particular
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.560]   time. It seems like I would be better off passively investing in multifamily real estate
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.320]   as everyone will always need a place to live. For the time being, I've decided to stop contributing
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   to my 401(k) so that I have enough to invest in a different manner, in things I can control."
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   So I just, I'm not the finance person here, so I'm curious to hear what you guys say,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.520]   but like, can you control the real estate market and multifamily housing?
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.560]   I agree that hope is not a strategy. They are right there. Also, Blair, this had to
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.280]   be from someone in the South because they put y'all in here, right? And I know that
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.000]   as someone in the North, I don't feel comfortable ever using that term.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.900]   I don't even use y'all. I need to get better at using y'all. It's actually a better way
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.640]   of saying you guys.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.980]   But my thinking here is shifting your investment strategy from financial assets like stocks
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.040]   and bonds in a 401(k) to multifamily real estate is simply trading one risk for another,
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.920]   right? I'm not saying you can't find success as a real estate investor. Like Blair, you
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.200]   and I both know people, clients that have been very successful real estate investors.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.480]   It can happen, but there are unique set of risks to that strategy. And I know there's
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.440]   a lot of investors that view real estate as like this tangible thing, so they think they
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.200]   can control it better because it seems like stocks feel like this just intangible thing
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.800]   that's out kind of in the ether, that you're like, you have no control over those corporations,
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.100]   or if investors get spooked or interest rates or whatever. But a lot of those other risks
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:30.600]   of owning single family or multifamily housing are just kind of different and idiosyncratic
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.360]   to those different areas. So, Blair, thoughts on some of the risks involved here?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.520]   I absolutely agree with that assessment. There's two parts to this question. One, that you
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.000]   don't have control over the investments in your 401(k). That's really not true. You can
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.880]   decide if you want to be in stocks, bonds, some combination of both. If you want in large
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.400]   cap stocks, small cap stocks, there's a menu of options available to you to build a diversified
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.880]   portfolio and you can go in and trade that account. Some of them limit it to two or three
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.280]   times a year and you don't want to be actively trading, but you do have some level of control.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.600]   Now if the question is I don't feel in control over stocks versus having real estate in my
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.920]   hand that I feel this sense of control over, just consider the fact that you also want
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.540]   a diversified portfolio. Maybe investing in multifamily real estate is a great option
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.440]   for you, but you wouldn't want to put all your eggs in that one basket. I think about
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.280]   living here in New Orleans. What if I had a portfolio of rentals here and we have another
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.480]   hurricane that displaces people for months? That's a huge risk. Having tenants move out,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.360]   not being able to re-rent the place, having to evict people. If it's development of multifamily
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.720]   homes, those are really risky. They're taking a lot of leverage with high interest rates.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.920]   So all investments incur a certain amount of risk. Even if you can't touch or feel bonds,
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.800]   you do have some control over your asset allocation in the 401(k).
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.600]   Lewis: I think the concentration is the biggest one. It's much harder to be diversified in
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.360]   real estate. So I think having that other piece is helpful. Also, you have liquidity
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.880]   risks where you can't exactly spend a home. Yes, you get monthly cash flows, but who knows
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:04.020]   how much that is covering what your costs are. It also could be more expensive than
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.600]   you assume, right? Because borrowing costs have gone up and the costs of upkeep and maintenance
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.680]   and taxes and all this stuff. If you have to replace a roof or find tenants. It is true
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   that everyone always needs a place to live, but I don't think that necessarily means that
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.940]   people are going to have to live right exactly where you buy. So the location could just
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.080]   be wrong. Like you said, there's other big risks that come. I wouldn't try to talk anyone
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.520]   out of investing in real estate. It's just a totally different set of risks if you don't
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.400]   know what you're doing. Because you're competing against people who really do know what they're
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:40.640]   doing. And even for them, it's not that easy. Exactly. So think of your 401(k) as part of
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.600]   your compensation. If you don't at least do that, you're taking a pay cut. So I think
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.880]   it's worth always doing the match at a minimum. Whether or not you don't want to lock up money
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.040]   that you can't spend until retirement or not is a different conversation. And there are
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.520]   reasons to save cash outside of the 401(k) as well. But at the end of the day, there's
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   nothing inherently -- it's not just hope if you're investing in a 401(k). A long-term
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.840]   diversified strategy will do well for you. All right. If you're investing in real estate,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.540]   you're hoping that you have income coming in and that it's going to grow over time.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.400]   And if you're investing in the stock market, you're having profits come in and dividends
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.440]   come in, and that's going to grow over time. Kind of the same thing. It's not any less
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.040]   real than investing in real estate. It's just more spread out. And imagine the people -- imagine
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.240]   if you owned the apartment building that I was living in back at the end of 2022. 30
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.960]   units, one person lets a pipe bust because they turned their heat off, and you're out
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.080]   of eight units. Eight units and the common areas all needed a ton of work. So, yeah.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.120]   There's definitely stuff out of your control.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.920]   Wathen: Yes. There's other risks there. Yep. Okay. So, I want to thank Blair for coming
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   on again, sharing her experience.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   Lapera: Thank you for having me.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.880]   Wathen: I appreciate that. I love when someone takes a general rule of thumb that people
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.400]   think in finance exists and then show an exception. Because I think there always are exceptions
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.960]   to these rules, right?
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   Lapera: 100%.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.880]   Wathen: If you have a question for us, email us. Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Leave us
