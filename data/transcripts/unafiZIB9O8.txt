[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460]   Especially given the age that we live in and in watching our brothers and sisters in the Middle East suffer at the hands of ISIS
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.020]   being driven from their homes and from their towns. This is a particularly relevant question from Kevin in California.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.800]   Dear Pastor John, in Matthew 6 we read, "What shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear?
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.420]   For the pagans run after these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.500]   But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well."
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.680]   So if this is true, why are there still millions of people starving to death in our world?
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.900]   Some Christians are starving to death in certain countries, even though they seek first the kingdom.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.380]   So how do we make sense of this promise, Pastor John?
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.660]   It is so crucial for Christians, especially Christian teachers and preachers, to take
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.460]   questions like this with utter seriousness.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.500]   So often we use promises in the Bible which on the face of it seem
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.660]   unrealistic and yet we don't pause to give some plausible
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.440]   explanation of how those promises
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.820]   are to be used,
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.700]   realistically used. So we need a heavy dose of realism
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.720]   whenever we embrace promises like this. So let's get it in front of us. Matthew 6,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.340]   25 to 34, that glorious paragraph.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.900]   Jesus' aim there is to give eight arguments, at least eight that I count, for why God's children
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.180]   don't need to have any anxiety.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.820]   And the summary and climax of the arguments is in verse 33 that he quotes,
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.300]   "But seek first the kingdom of God and
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.420]   His righteousness and all these things will be added to you." And the "all these things"
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.820]   clearly is referring back to
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.780]   what are you gonna eat? What are you gonna drink?
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.780]   What are you gonna wear? And he's saying don't be anxious about any of those things.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.820]   And now he ends by saying you're gonna have all of those that you need. So Kevin raises the question rightly, "Well,
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.260]   do Christians ever perish from exposure or starvation?
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.980]   Is Jesus promising that his followers who have faith will never lack food, never lack clothing?"
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.900]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.980]   Now, several things should give us pause
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.140]   before we think that Jesus is naive or
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.460]   simplistic or false in this verse.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:43.020]   Consider three other passages and let them really sink in. This is a reality check, not from
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.300]   experience over against Jesus. That's a bad way to do exegesis, but
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.980]   Bible and Jesus' words in particular over against Jesus
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.220]   clarifying what he means here. So for example, Luke 21
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.260]   16 to 18. Jesus says, "You will be delivered up."
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.700]   He's talking to these people who don't need to be anxious about anything because every need will be met.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.140]   "You will be delivered up by parents and brothers and relatives and friends and some of you they will put to death.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.900]   You will be hated by all for my name's sake,
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.540]   but not a hair of your head will perish."
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.820]   So Jesus promises that some of his anxiety-free people
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.700]   will be put to death. Now, these are people who in Matthew 6 33
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.420]   have believed, trusting, "All the things will be given me that I need and they're gonna be killed."
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.460]   And it doesn't say how they're going to be put to death.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.300]   Starved to death in prison? Killed by chaining them outside in below freezing weather with no clothes? It doesn't say.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:01.420]   Persecution has assumed every imaginable form in the history of the church. And then he says, "Not a hair of your head will perish."
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.100]   Surely that promise is just as sweeping as, "All things will be added to you."
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.700]   Like,
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.420]   "Not only will they be added to you, not one hair is going to be hurt." And he says that
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.220]   what, 10 words after saying they're going to kill you. Killed, but no harm done.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.020]   No ultimate harm done.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.740]   Now that should give us pause.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.700]   If Jesus can say, "Not a hair of your head is going to perish," right after he says they're going to kill you,
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.620]   we better be slow
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.540]   to say that all your needs are going to be met. Means you can't die of hunger. That's number one.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   Philippians chapter 4,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   11 and 19. Here's Paul.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.640]   "I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.840]   and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I've learned the secret of facing plenty and
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.820]   hunger,
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.920]   abundance, and need. I can do all things to him who strengthens me. All things, including hunger."
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.960]   Verse 19, "And my God
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   will supply
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.640]   every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus." So verse 19 is very similar to Matthew 6,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.800]   33. One says, "All these things will be added to you," and the other says, "Every need you have will be met."
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.480]   And yet Paul has just said, "I know how to be brought low.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.400]   I know how to face hunger." In other words, God's promise to meet every need
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.800]   does not mean providing all the food and clothing we think we need.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.800]   One more text.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   Romans 8, 32 to 37.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.120]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.960]   will he not with him freely give us all things
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.720]   with him?"
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.160]   Now that's the same as Matthew 6, 33. "All things." He's going to give you all things.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.240]   What you eat, what you wear, what you drink. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.280]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or," here they are, "famine or
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.680]   nakedness,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.220]   danger, sword, as it is written, 'For your sake we're being killed all day long, starved to death, put out in exposure.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.080]   We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.'" No!
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.680]   In all these things, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. So
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.320]   Paul virtually says
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.520]   that some Christians will die of distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.120]   and
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.720]   what does he mean?
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   God will give us all things.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.960]   Now, here's my answer to that question.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   When I put all this together,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:53.740]   Jesus' words and Paul's two texts, when I put all this together, I think the meaning of Matthew 6, 33 and Romans 8, 32,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.280]   and other promises like this, and there are a lot of them, I think it means
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.580]   everything will be given to us that we need
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.700]   in order to do God's will,
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.140]   in order to glorify God most fully,
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.860]   even if it means
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.220]   death.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   Jesus isn't promising
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.100]   all the food, all the clothing, all the housing, all the health care, all the protection that we need to be
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.740]   comfortable or even to stay alive. He says we're going to die in his service. He's promising
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:35.860]   that we will have every single one of those things in exactly the right measure for doing
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:43.960]   his will and glorifying his name, even if it means perishing from exposure or starvation in the path of obedience.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.900]   That is a sobering word. Thank you, Pastor John, for the question. Thank you, Kevin.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.140]   The week has now come to an end, and we're going to break for the weekend now. On Monday,
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.260]   we address another difficult question from a listener in Arizona who wants to know, based on what he sees in 1 Thessalonians
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.420]   5 19,
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.660]   what does it mean to not quench the Holy Spirit, and how do we quench the Holy Spirit in our lives?
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.660]   How do we know if we're doing that?
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:14.680]   That is on Monday. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a great weekend.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   You
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   You
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
