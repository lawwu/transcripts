[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   There was truth and there was untruth.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.680]   And if you clung to the truth,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.220]   even against the whole world, you were not mad.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.920]   1984 by George Orwell
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.880]   is one of the most impactful books ever written.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.620]   It has been widely used and misused in political discourse
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.480]   by all kinds of ideologues.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.600]   Into that discourse, it entered terms like Big Brother,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.360]   Thought Crime, Double Think, Newspeak, Thought Police,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.440]   and Orwellian.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.240]   Strangely enough, as a synonym for the very thing
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.720]   that the author Orwell was against.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.040]   It's been translated in over 65 languages,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.200]   has sold over 30 million copies,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.400]   has been banned in many countries,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.480]   especially authoritarian regimes,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.060]   has been banned under Stalin,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.440]   and as recently as 2022 in Belarus.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   In this video, I'll give a quick summary with spoilers
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.440]   and a few takeaways.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   I'd like to try to make it somewhat interesting
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.720]   to people who both have and have not read the book.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.800]   Let's see how it goes.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880]   The world in the book 1984
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.200]   is a dystopian future society, nation,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.880]   maybe you can say super state named Oceania.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.860]   It's fully controlled by a totalitarian political party
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.200]   called Inksock.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520]   It's led by Big Brother, who as we might discuss,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.440]   may or may not be a real person.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.620]   He might just be a symbol used by the party.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.120]   The party wants only to increase its power,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.080]   also something we might talk about.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.420]   It uses technology, telescreens for mass surveillance.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.400]   It's creating a new language called Newspeak,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.720]   which removes words from English
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.360]   that could lead to rebellion.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   It uses doublethink to control thought
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.240]   by perhaps you could say,
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.440]   forcing you to hold contradictory beliefs
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.040]   and accept them as true.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.880]   If not, the thought police arrest you
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.480]   for committing a thought crime.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.880]   Examples of doublethink are war is peace,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.080]   freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.400]   And finally, the party constantly rewrites history.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   As the quote goes,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   "Who controls the past, controls the future.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.520]   "Who controls the present, controls the past."
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.320]   There are several ministries, four of them.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.400]   Ministry of Truth is responsible for propaganda
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.580]   and like I said, rewriting history.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.240]   Ministry of Love is responsible for brainwashing people
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.720]   through torture.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.840]   Ministry of Plenty is responsible for rationing of food,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360]   supplies and goods.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.960]   And Ministry of Peace, of course,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.320]   is responsible for maintaining constant state of war.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.600]   Society is divided into three levels.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.400]   The inner party, the outer party and the proles.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.960]   The stands for, I guess, proletariats.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.600]   It's the working class.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.760]   The inner party is tiny,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.120]   the outer party is a little bit bigger
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.700]   and majority of the people,
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.840]   I forget what the percentage is,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.600]   maybe 80% is the proles, the working class.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.960]   There's several key characters.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.520]   Winston, the main character,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.480]   is a low-ranking member of Inksock.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.040]   He works at the Ministry of Truth
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.800]   where he rewrites history, like I mentioned.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   Julia is a dark-haired girl
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.360]   who Winston falls in love with and she with him.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120]   They have sex.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.020]   And this is maybe a good place to mention
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.040]   that passionate sex, love and passionate sex,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.300]   are forbidden in this society.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.900]   Good sex, I think, is a term under Newspeak, #goodsex,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.300]   is the kind of sex that leads to procreation,
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.540]   which is the only kind of sex that's allowed
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.340]   and the only kind of sex that's good.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.660]   O'Brien is another central character.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.520]   He's the member of the inner party
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.800]   that convinces Winston he's part of the Brotherhood,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.300]   which is a lie.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.220]   And he eventually is the man who tortures Winston
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.960]   and breaks his mind, breaks his heart.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.200]   Big Brother and Emanuel Goldstein
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.700]   are these symbolic characters
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.840]   that we never actually get to meet.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.340]   They may or may not exist.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.980]   Big Brother is the head of the party, Inksock,
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.920]   and Emanuel Goldstein is the leader
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.500]   of the so-called Brotherhood,
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.540]   which is this supposed mysterious group
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.820]   that lurks in the shadows
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.780]   and works to overthrow the party.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.980]   Again, may or may not exist.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.180]   We'll maybe talk about the importance of that
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.020]   in a totalitarian state.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.460]   So a few key takeaways,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.900]   and I'll try to do my best.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.740]   I have disparate notes that I took for myself.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.220]   I'll try to do my best to try to integrate them together
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.060]   to make some cohesive thoughts.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.720]   And part of the reason I wanted to do this,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.660]   while I have read "1984" many times in my life,
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.140]   and many of the books I've put on a reading list
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.740]   that I want to read, I read many times,
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.660]   I haven't often really concretized
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.420]   my thoughts about the books.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.580]   I just take the journey and just let the thoughts
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.340]   kind of wander around in the background as I live my life.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.780]   I wanted to kind of put on paper
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.700]   and maybe share with others to see what they think,
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.060]   what my concrete takeaways are from the book,
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.020]   what my thoughts are,
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.140]   if I could try to convert them into words.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.420]   So the first one for me,
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.000]   especially later in life as I've been reading this book,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.900]   is that when everything else,
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.540]   or most things that make you human are taken away
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.780]   by those around you, by the totalitarian state,
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.500]   the last thing that's left
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.060]   that is the most difficult to take away is love.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.360]   Love for other human beings, love for life itself.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.500]   That's the little flame from which hope springs.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.580]   That's the key revolutionary act, is the act of love.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.460]   So when the ability to speak is taken away,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.500]   when the ability to think, rational thoughts is taken away,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.140]   the last thing that's left,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.940]   and the thing that ultimately gives hope is love.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.300]   That's a big takeaway for me,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.300]   and the note that Julia gives to Winston,
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.100]   the note reading, "I love you,"
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.660]   is the kind of revolutionary act
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.420]   that leads to a society beyond the one they exist in.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.260]   I think a lot of the book
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.380]   has an interesting hypocrisy to it,
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.780]   where the main character, Winston,
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.700]   is almost in an animalistic way
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.660]   obsessed with destroying the state
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.420]   in "Rebellion" and "Revolution,"
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.100]   but I think love is the thing that allows you
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.020]   to believe in a place beyond the state,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.980]   in believing that you can build something better,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.940]   versus destroying the thing you're in.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.460]   I think you have to be careful as a revolutionary
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.820]   not to obsess 100% with destruction,
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.020]   because beyond destruction,
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.980]   there could be chaos that leads to something much worse.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.300]   I think love is the thing,
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.500]   the basic human thing that connects all of us,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.400]   the messy thing that connects all of us,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.480]   that allows you to build a better society
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.160]   after the totalitarian one is overthrown.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.980]   What else do I wanna say?
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.380]   There's an interesting tension there
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.600]   between love and sex, or lust.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.060]   I think there's a quote that,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.220]   pure love or pure lust was impossible or forbidden.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.860]   Pure love and pure lust.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.860]   Pure here meaning sort of unadulterated,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.340]   uncensored intensity of feeling, maybe intimacy.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.140]   And that was an interesting question raised by the book,
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.700]   both by Winston and Julia,
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.000]   is what is ultimately the thing,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.660]   the most powerful act of rebellion?
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.460]   Is it, between us humans,
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.860]   when everything is forbidden?
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.700]   Is it animalistic like sex?
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.080]   Just lust, lust for another human.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.140]   Or is it love?
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.820]   The kind of love you have for a romantic partner,
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.540]   but even love for family, love for friends.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.380]   I don't know.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.380]   I think the book almost claims that it is sex,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.180]   but I think what the book also shows
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.740]   is if sex is your manifestation of rebellion,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.460]   that that ultimately leads to something that doesn't last.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.460]   That ultimately leads to a focus on destruction
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:38.900]   versus building beyond the horizon when the state falls.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.900]   So some quotes from Winston on this.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.780]   The more men you've had sex with,
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.780]   so Julia admitted to have sex with quite a lot of people.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.700]   He says, "The more men you've had sex with,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.980]   "the more I love you.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.960]   "I hate purity.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.920]   "I hate virtue.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.240]   "I want everyone to be corrupt to the bone."
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.460]   This kind of rubbed me the wrong way,
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.660]   because again, this seems to be obsessed
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.940]   with the hatred towards the state
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.340]   versus a longing and a hope,
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.500]   which I think hope is really important here.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.660]   A hope for a better future beyond the state.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.980]   Again, another quote from the book.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.900]   Their embrace had been a battle, the climax of victory.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.300]   It was a blow struck against the party.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.100]   It was a political act.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.060]   So there, again, I think sex is a political act,
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.060]   an act of political rebellion.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.620]   I think that's not the deeply human thing here.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.700]   The deeply human thing is, again, the act of love.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.580]   It's a source of hope.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.920]   It's the catalyst for building a better future
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.300]   beyond the revolution.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.220]   An interesting side note here,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.100]   and there could be a million interesting side notes,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.900]   and I'm desperately trying not to go on a million tangent
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.940]   and to hold myself together here to stay focused,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.260]   is on family.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.380]   So there's all kinds of love,
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.500]   and I think family love is a really powerful bond
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.420]   that connects us,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.500]   and that's one of the things
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.780]   that the totalitarian states really go after.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.780]   And I should actually mention,
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.180]   sort of loosely using term authoritarian
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.100]   and totalitarian here,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.340]   but I think, to me at least,
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.620]   I don't know what others think,
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.980]   but to me, authoritarian means
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.140]   where there's a government,
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.500]   a centralized, complete centralized control
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.880]   of political affairs,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.300]   and a totalitarian state is a complete,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.120]   is beyond that,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.060]   is a complete control of not just politics
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.420]   and the functions of government,
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.740]   the basics of the functions of government,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.740]   but also social, economic, everything.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.420]   It's, Nazi Germany is an example of that,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.840]   I think, to me,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.960]   where there's just complete control of every single thing,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.280]   from the war effort to the social interactions,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.520]   the rules that govern social interaction to the press,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.200]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.440]   So I think this book is more about,
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   at least in my definition of the term,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.380]   about totalitarianism.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.600]   Anyway, as I was saying on family,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.840]   I think the way they destroy family,
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.680]   one, of course, with your romantic partner,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.080]   forbidding passion,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.920]   passionate sex,
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.860]   but really just passion,
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.840]   longing for another human being in that romantic way.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.280]   And they also really reward and encourage children
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.160]   at a young age,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.500]   they indoctrinate them,
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.520]   to turn their parents in for thought crime,
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.960]   whether real or not,
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.600]   which of course is a silly notion
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.320]   because it doesn't,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.280]   there's no nature of truth,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.480]   there's no,
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.000]   you can just accuse anyone of anything
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.120]   and they're guilty by just existing.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.000]   So that's a way to attack the family.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.360]   And I should also mention on the topic of love,
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.900]   is that I think the goal of the party,
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.760]   the final destination,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.200]   as used by O'Brien through the process of torture,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.960]   is for, to break your mind,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.380]   to break your heart and soul completely,
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.360]   so that the only love you can have,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   and it could be felt as a pure love,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.280]   is for big brother.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.880]   This is the kind of thing you see in North Korea,
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.480]   is that the only love you're allowed to have,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.600]   the remaining inklings of feeling
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.800]   that might still exist in you,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.400]   you can channel only,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.240]   not towards family,
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.440]   not towards romantic partners,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.060]   not towards friends,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.080]   but towards this leader,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.720]   this godlike messianic figure,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.680]   in this case, who may or may not exist,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.760]   in all cases, that figure,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.620]   while there is a human associated with it,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.760]   it's really much bigger than the human.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.160]   And that's the only love you're allowed to have.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.880]   So the other takeaway I have is on the topic of hate.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.680]   I think all humans have the capacity,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.000]   almost an animalistic craving,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.660]   for hate of the other, the enemy,
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.740]   whether it's individuals like Emmanuel Goldstein,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.480]   or nations like Eurasia and East Asia,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.100]   which I should say are the two other super states
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.680]   described in this book,
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.800]   they're constantly at war with each other.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.000]   Again, the fascinating thing
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.260]   about the way this book is written,
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.580]   is you don't know if Eurasia or East Asia exists.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.680]   You really don't know what exists,
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.760]   or what is true beyond the local little interaction,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.240]   local little world of the main character.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.120]   And that, I think, is the point.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.980]   When you don't really know,
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.080]   there's no steady footing on which to construct
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.920]   a worldview from which you can have hope
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.480]   about a better future.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.780]   That longing for a better future.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.380]   And so this animalistic craving for hate,
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.960]   or the capacity to have hate,
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.320]   especially when we're in crowds,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.960]   I think is most powerfully illustrated
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.580]   in the two minutes of hate,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.440]   which is practiced by the society.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.160]   And the quote is,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   "The horrible thing about the two minutes of hate
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.880]   "was not that one was obliged to act a part,
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.520]   "but that it was impossible to avoid joining in.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.860]   "Within 30 seconds, any pretense was always unnecessary.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.140]   "A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness,
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.940]   "a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.260]   "with a sledgehammer,
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.200]   "seemed to flow through the whole group of people
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.020]   "like an electric current,
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.340]   "turning one, even against one's will,
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.000]   "into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.400]   "And yet, the rage that one felt
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.320]   "was an abstract, undirected emotion,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.140]   "which could be switched from one object to another
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.680]   "like the flame of a blow lamp."
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.600]   That's the point, is you get the crowd together,
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.120]   you get them to hate Goldstein, or Eurasia, or East Asia,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.800]   you get them to hate anything.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.360]   And because that feeling, that drug,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.040]   that hypnotic,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.800]   that mass hypnosis that you feel
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.740]   can be directed by the state into any direction,
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.740]   and because you have complete control of history,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.040]   you can direct it on a day-by-day basis
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.600]   towards any target.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.400]   And as long as the hate is catalyzed
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.200]   through these kinds of rituals,
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.780]   as long as the hate is there,
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.280]   it can overpower the individualistic feeling of love
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.600]   we have for each other.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.460]   So that hate is a more animalistic desire.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.480]   I don't know what to make of it.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.040]   Of course, it's also important to say that this book,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.200]   I think I've read many places that it was intended
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.920]   originally by Orwell as a satire,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   although a satire that has quite a lot of torture
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.680]   at the end, and doesn't seem to have much humor.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.580]   But I think if you read it as a satire,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.680]   that's the way it's better to understand
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.640]   its relevance in our society today,
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.640]   because a lot of things like "Two Minutes of Hate"
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.960]   is almost like a caricature of what hate looks like
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.180]   in a mass gathering.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.200]   But if you take it as a caricature,
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.280]   it can now reveal you some of the elements
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.480]   that already exist in human nature that are there,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.380]   and that we should be very cautious about.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.600]   So it reveals the very thing that,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.180]   if not monitored by ourselves,
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.280]   can result in a slippery slope that leads to,
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   yeah, destruction of the tribalism,
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.600]   destruction of other groups,
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   and then control of the collective intelligence
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.840]   of our species through the totalitarian state.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.240]   I think there's elements of this
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.200]   that are just under illustration in social media today.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.560]   I don't wanna overstate it.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.280]   I think just like comparing things to Hitler,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.040]   comparing things to 1984, I think is a reach in most cases.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.200]   But social media does reveal this kind of mass hysteria,
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.840]   this capacity of humans to be outraged,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.160]   of outrage based on tribalism.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.360]   So we have to understand it.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.120]   We have to resist giving into it on the individual level.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.840]   And I do believe we have the responsibility
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.320]   to create technology that helps us resist it,
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.120]   that incentivizes us not to be cruel to each other
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.360]   just because all the people in whatever tribe
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.240]   we define ourselves in are being cruel
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.680]   to a particular person or a particular group.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.260]   Another takeaway I have is about power.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:29.600]   Ingsoc, the totalitarian states, wants only one thing,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.700]   and that is power.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.540]   Power is both the means and the end, absolute power.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.700]   That's what O'Brien describes,
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.300]   and there's a lot of quotes about this
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.540]   in the torture part of the book.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.500]   O'Brien says, "The real power,
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.060]   "the power we have to fight for night and day,
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.820]   "is not power over things, but power over men.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.920]   "Power is inflicting pain and humiliation.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.040]   "Power is in tearing human minds to pieces
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.520]   "and putting them together again
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.860]   "in new shapes of your own choosing.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.700]   "Power is not a means, it is an end.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.440]   "One does not establish a dictatorship
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.780]   "in order to safeguard a revolution.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.320]   "One makes the revolution
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.700]   "in order to establish a dictatorship.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.320]   "The object of persecution is persecution.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.120]   "The object of torture is torture.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.880]   "The object of power is power."
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.580]   This, of course, is another aspect of human nature,
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.400]   the will to power,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.120]   and the tendency of that power to corrupt.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:39.940]   O'Brien says also, "The weariness of the cell
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.740]   "is the vigor of the organism."
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.780]   Through the torture of the individual,
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.180]   through the breaking of the individual,
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.460]   through the death of the individual
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.660]   that doesn't exist according to the history,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.060]   all of that doesn't matter.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.500]   What matters is the organism.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.900]   And there's been a lot of brilliant comments
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.540]   throughout social media and on Reddit.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.100]   I just wanna highlight something about this
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.340]   'cause I had the exact same feeling
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.180]   as I was this time rereading it.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.140]   There's a comment from a Reddit user
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.780]   whose name is BraveSky6764.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.740]   He said, "The conversation between Lex and Michael Levin,"
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.740]   who is a brilliant biologist, engineer,
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.760]   "came to mind when O'Brien made an analogy
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.140]   "to an organism which survives
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.880]   "even as the individual cells pass away.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.840]   "And the great purges are analogous
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.500]   "to the cutting of a fingernail."
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:39.040]   If you see society as an organism,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:46.760]   which I think is the way a totalitarian state sees it,
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.840]   then the destruction of a large percentage of that society,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.420]   the murder, the torture,
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.900]   all kinds of atrocities and genocide become justifiable
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.840]   as long as the organism flourishes.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.740]   And that's how you get to the ideas that Stalin had,
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.760]   it's okay to break a few eggs to make an omelet.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:14.500]   This devaluation of a human being
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.980]   as of fundamental importance in a society,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.380]   that's a slippery slope into atrocities.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.680]   It's not just deeply unethical
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.200]   from our understanding of morals and ethics.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.920]   It is also very unproductive.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.680]   It destroys the human spirit.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.160]   And the human spirit is essential
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.740]   for building of a great society of constant progress.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.280]   I think that's also one of the other messages of the book
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.720]   is about utopia,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   that totalitarianism results when you chase perfection.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.860]   When you present this idea of utopia.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.280]   There is no utopia, there is no perfect society.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.400]   I think, at least for me, that's takeaway.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.720]   I think the optimal state of being for an individual
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   and for a state is a constant turnover, constant change.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.120]   And in the case of a state,
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.360]   it's a constant turnover of leaders, of ideas,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.700]   and always hopefully in the longterm making progress
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.520]   towards a better world.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.220]   But it's always going to be messy.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.920]   Perfection only exists in a oppressive state.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.800]   Perfection only exists when you remove the basic humanity
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.000]   of the individuals that make up that state,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.400]   when you destroy the human spirit,
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.160]   or when you suppress and you destroy all the freedoms.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.480]   Because freedom is going to be messy,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.940]   it's going to be very chaotic.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.680]   But that freedom ultimately,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.320]   is at least in the long arc of history,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.300]   is going to create progress.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   - So yes, as the Redditor Brave Sky 6764 says,
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.900]   that does actually give you a perspective
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.180]   of a biological system where it's
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.460]   a bunch of living organisms.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.940]   Each one of us are made up of a bunch of living organisms,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.380]   and we take that for granted
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.820]   of all the atrocities that are happening there.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.940]   And we don't seem to give a damn.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.780]   I think that's a really good metaphor for us to help.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.060]   If you want to put yourself in the mind of the inner party,
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.900]   a big brother of the people that are in power
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.500]   in those situations, I think a lot of them,
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.180]   if most of them, if not all of them,
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.860]   see themselves as doing good for the world,
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.660]   as doing good for the society.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.060]   And they're able to justify that
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.780]   the way we justify the murder
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.720]   of the different cells in our body.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.420]   You don't even think of them as worthy of consideration.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.140]   You don't think of them as living beings
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.340]   of having the same value as you.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.260]   And that's one of the really powerful ideas
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.720]   at the founding of the United States,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.260]   that all men are created equal,
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.340]   that there's an equal worth to a human being,
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.660]   no matter who that human being is.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.700]   That idea, at the very least,
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.360]   as flawed as its implementations have been,
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.820]   is a really, really powerful idea,
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.340]   and it's a non-trivial idea.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.340]   And that idea resists the drug of totalitarianism,
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.660]   the drug of power.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.980]   I do believe that on the topic of power and politics,
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.940]   that 1984, as I've mentioned,
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.940]   has been, I would say, misused by political ideologues.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.300]   I've seen it, for example,
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.380]   on conservatives in the United States,
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.380]   have used 1984 to call left-wing policies Orwellian.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.660]   I think that's an overstatement,
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.180]   and of course, used for dramatic effect,
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.020]   but it should be at least said
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.420]   that Orwell was a democratic socialist.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.420]   1984 is not a criticism of socialism.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.660]   It's a criticism of totalitarianism.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.100]   And I think the point is a warning against totalitarianism
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.700]   in all forms, that all political ideologies
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.560]   can succumb to the allure of power and be corrupted by it.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.820]   And I think people on the left in the United States
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.700]   and people on the right can both be corrupted by power.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.100]   So this kind of one-way criticism
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.180]   of left-wing policies as Orwellian
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.640]   is a very kind of convenient shorthand,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.980]   but the reality is all men and politicians
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.980]   are capable of creating an Orwellian world.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:35.940]   And I think one of the things that is highlighted
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.760]   in the book very well, I would say,
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.540]   if I interpret it correctly, is the hypocrisy of Winston.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.500]   When O'Brien asks Winston what he's willing to do
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.460]   to overthrow the party,
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.660]   what he's willing to do for the brotherhood,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.860]   Winston admits that he is willing to do atrocities.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.160]   He's willing to do evil onto children,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.740]   onto anybody, murder, anything.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.260]   And I think this is a really powerful illustration
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.140]   that both the totalitarian
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.220]   and the blind, immoral resistance,
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.740]   rebellion against the totalitarian state can both be evil.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.220]   And I think that's where I return to love
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.740]   is the thing that carries hope for a world
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.420]   beyond this battle.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.340]   It's a very important battle for freedom,
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.580]   but you have to have that.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.580]   Otherwise, it's the Orwellian state
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.060]   and the resistance to Orwellian state
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.940]   can both destroy basic human rights and freedoms.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.420]   I think sort of in the character of Winston,
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.820]   that's illustrated well.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.500]   And I should also mention that there's interesting writing.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.540]   Now, I'm not obviously a scholar of Orwell,
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.460]   and there's a lot of books been written,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.780]   and I should probably recommend them somewhere.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.500]   There's just great books written on 1984 on Orwell,
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.620]   on the historical context in which he was operating
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.340]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:01.180]   But as far as I see, Orwell, also with 1984
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.300]   and himself politically,
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.620]   he was not espousing the complete opposite
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.540]   of totalitarianism.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.580]   There is, again, with democratic socialism,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.660]   that there is value to the connection between human beings,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.220]   that you have to lean on each other, help each other,
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   that society is fundamentally a cohesive collective
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:26.460]   than a completely sort of disparate set of systems
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.620]   or disparate set of sovereign individuals.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.540]   It's both.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.700]   And I think he was torn about that idea
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.900]   because in order to resist a totalitarian state,
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.380]   you have to fight for those basic individual freedoms.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.380]   But at the same time, a society, a well-functioning society
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.380]   allows for that freedom to manifest as a collaboration.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.220]   And so that's the difficult challenge there.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.300]   Again, that's why he was a democratic socialist.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.700]   And the criticism of the book was against totalitarianism,
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.700]   of a centralized state that controls speech, thought,
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.940]   the press, and all the basic human freedoms,
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.620]   controls truth.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.020]   And I think a lot of people would ask the question,
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.740]   and I hear this tossed around,
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.980]   do we live in the world of 1984 today?
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.180]   And I think that's used as a shorthand
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.420]   to sort of criticize different policies
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.980]   and different governments.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:29.100]   I generally don't like the use of that kind of language
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.100]   because it's basically crying wolf.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.040]   If everything is 1984, if everybody is Hitler,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.900]   then you're not going to,
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.900]   there's no way to kind of properly normalize the discussion
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:46.380]   of what's, of the lesser of two evils kind of thing,
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.140]   which is ultimately what democracy is about.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.880]   You have a collection of things you're picking.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.020]   They all kind of suck,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.660]   but you want to pick the one that sucks the least.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.660]   That's human society, that's human nature, it's messy.
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.060]   And so I don't think we live in a 1984 state,
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.260]   but there's a lot of elements that this book reveals
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.260]   about human nature and about the operation
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.020]   of a totalitarian state that we should be on the watch for.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.940]   So surveillance, a state of double think,
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.900]   of controlling language,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.020]   of being in a constant state of war
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.940]   as a way to control the population
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.380]   and the flow of resources,
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.180]   all those things have elements of,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.660]   almost like a useful tools for the establishment
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.820]   of complete control of a populace.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.020]   And the moment you notice those elements,
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.220]   it's our job to resist those elements.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.700]   So I think the point is we have to be vigilant
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.340]   to the slippery slope of the will to power
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.520]   in centralized institutions.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.400]   Another thing I want to mention is that
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.840]   I think a lot of people rightfully compliment Orwell
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.240]   to have predict some of the elements of future society,
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.520]   especially with technology, technological capabilities
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.840]   that are with, for example,
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.440]   telescreens used by the state to control the population.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.760]   Maybe I can make a few comments on technology in general.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.960]   People who criticize technology will often use 1984
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.040]   as an example that, you know,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.480]   technology is a tool for a totalitarian state.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.440]   It's a way they can achieve full control
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.080]   and we should be extremely cautious of it.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.720]   And I think that's, there's a kernel of truth to that,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.320]   but it's not obviously to me that on the whole technology
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.440]   is a tool for totalitarian control.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.560]   That I think it is also a tool for freedom.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.680]   The internet is an incredible tool for freedom.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.800]   And so of course we have to fight for that freedom,
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   but I believe in general, the greater,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.560]   let's just take the internet broadly as an example,
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.000]   and there's a lot of sub elements of that
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.840]   and like a more sort of platonic sense
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.920]   of what the internet is, which is digital interconnectivity.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.960]   We have to fight for the freedom,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.880]   but in general, the greater reach and access
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.440]   that the internet has,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.220]   the more powerful the resistance to totalitarianism.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.680]   Technology is a double-edged sword.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.040]   It provides the tools for oppression
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.560]   and the tools for the ongoing fight for freedom.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.160]   And as long as the will to fight
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.320]   arises in the human heart,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.760]   technology, I think, helps humanity win.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.520]   And of course, there's been a lot of discussion
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.880]   about free speech and the freedom of thought.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.800]   And there's a lot to be said there
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.880]   that's much more nuanced than the book "1984" provides.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   I think "1984" just shows the end, horrible conclusion
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.040]   of complete totalitarian control over speech,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.280]   over thought, over feeling, over everything.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.520]   But in general, my view of it is
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.320]   this is kind of inspiration to,
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.840]   in order to prevent ourselves
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.040]   from slipping into an authoritarian,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.200]   into a totalitarian state,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.280]   Orwellian type of dystopias, to avoid them,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.440]   we have to value critical and independent thought.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.840]   I think thought first before speech, just thought.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.640]   I think you have to learn to think deeply
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.760]   from first principles,
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.320]   independent of whatever tribe you find yourselves in,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.840]   independent of government, independent of groups,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.200]   independent of the people around you,
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   the people you love, that love you.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.760]   You have to learn at least sometimes to think independently.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.120]   Now, this is the Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.760]   the abyss gazes into you.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.320]   If you think too independently,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.560]   it can break your mind.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.520]   I mean, we are social creatures, we need that connection.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.680]   But I think it's like what the Tom Waits,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.840]   I like my Tom a little drop of poison.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.280]   I think of truly deeply independent thought
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.720]   as a little drop of poison that's necessary for your own mind.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.160]   Most of your life you live,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.040]   you kind of assume most things around you are true,
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.080]   and that's very useful.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.880]   We stand on the shoulders of giants,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.560]   but you on a regular occasion have to question,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.800]   question your assumption, question your biases,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.960]   question everything,
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.700]   question the things you've taken for granted,
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.760]   question what everybody's telling you, but not too much.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.760]   It's a tricky balance.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.480]   But the act of rebellion against the totalitarian state,
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.320]   against the slippery slope into that state
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.280]   is that independent thought.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.760]   And of course, speech is a manifestation of that thought.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.000]   So to avoid echo chambers in both thought and speech,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.160]   like I said, you have to question your assumptions,
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.400]   challenge your biases.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.440]   I think that's the way out,
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.600]   or maybe that's a resistance mechanism
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.480]   to slipping into authoritarianism.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.080]   And maybe I have a few more things to say
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.440]   about the latter part of the book,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.400]   the part where there's torture,
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   where there's room 101 that has the thing you fear the most,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.880]   which is different for all of us.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.360]   And for Winston, that's rats.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.520]   Makes you wonder what that thing is for each of us.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.560]   I left a mental note for myself to do more research
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.880]   into the historical context,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.600]   the psychology, the neuroscience,
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.620]   the effectiveness of torture.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.540]   I think there's probably a lot of really good work.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.120]   I had a brief conversation with Andrew Huberman
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.560]   on the phone about this topic.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.840]   Andrew Huberman, the brilliant Andrew Huberman,
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.680]   host of the Huberman Lab podcast you should listen to.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.120]   And then he mentioned to me
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.440]   there's a bunch of papers on these topics.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.680]   This has been studied,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.300]   sort of the carrot and the stick
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.460]   of the ability of incentives and disincentives
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.320]   to control the perception
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.220]   and the mental state of people and animals.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.120]   And he mentioned to me a few folks
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.760]   that I could talk to on a podcast
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.200]   about this topic in a few books.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.160]   So I'll definitely look into this more.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.840]   I think 1984 is probably,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.760]   it uses torture as a philosophical description,
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.760]   as a caricature of the operation of a totalitarian state.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.480]   But at the same time,
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.440]   a lot of those elements were all done
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.100]   under Stalin in the Soviet Union.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.480]   So it's not like it's very different
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.960]   or very far from reality.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.320]   It's very, very real.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.400]   The question is about the actual effect
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.720]   it has on the human mind,
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.120]   which I really have to think
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.000]   because torture in this case breaks Winston.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.720]   In fact, I'd like to believe that many people
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.560]   in the most fundamental ways can't be broken in this way.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:47.600]   I've seen science, again, without extensively reading,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.240]   so please correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.600]   but I've seen science that shows that torture
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.360]   for the purpose of intelligence gathering is not effective.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.160]   It's not effective to get accurate information
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.880]   because people will tell you anything, really,
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.980]   to stop the torture,
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.340]   stop the physical and the mental, the emotional suffering.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.400]   So that, but I think this book is about the use of torture
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.680]   to completely break your ability to think
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.640]   and to perceive the world.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   One of the things I talk to Andrew about
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.840]   is whether it's possible to control perception
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.300]   through these kinds of things.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.520]   And it seems that there is literature
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.720]   that shows it's possible to literally change
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.200]   your perception of the world.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.720]   Like in this case, in 1984,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.800]   it's when you're holding up four fingers,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.880]   can you actually make the person believe
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.740]   that you're holding up five fingers?
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.940]   Not because of some weird illusion
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.140]   or just because your vision is blurry or any of that,
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.860]   but you literally, when you look,
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.080]   I'm holding four fingers and what you see is five fingers.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.620]   Not because your vision is poor, no.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.020]   Your visual cortex,
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.020]   the way you're processing that information,
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.820]   something about the processing
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.460]   changes completely your perception.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.740]   If I tell you there's a straight line,
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.660]   can through incentive or disincentive,
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.060]   can you start seeing like a crooked line
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.380]   or something like that?
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.060]   Anyway, I think that there's literature that supports that,
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.080]   which is by the way, terrifying.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.300]   But the thing I'd like to research into more
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.960]   is if that can be long lasting.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.820]   Is that I just don't believe it can be.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.540]   If you're not pushed to your death,
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.860]   yes, maybe perception, maybe your willingness to think,
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.060]   but your ability to think,
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.780]   your actual ability to think independent thoughts,
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.100]   maybe you're terrified.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.920]   I understand if you're terrified of any more,
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.460]   any more kind of thinking that leads to rebellious thoughts.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.700]   Like the book mentions the idea of face crime,
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.860]   where you can reveal your thoughts,
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.580]   the inner workings of your mind,
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.180]   but the subtleties of your expressions in your face.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:03.140]   And I think also like Winston O'Brien says,
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.180]   if you want to keep a secret,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.820]   you must also hide it from yourself.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.940]   So I can understand that.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.980]   I can understand that.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.460]   And maybe that is the basic mechanism that torture leads to
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.620]   that you just learn your body,
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   your mind learns to hide the truth from yourself.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.580]   Like you're not, you don't even allow yourself to think it
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.660]   because you know, if you think it,
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.460]   it's going to lead to face crime and thought crime.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.940]   And that's going to lead to more torture.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.240]   That's possible. That's possible.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   But I just can't imagine the capacity for love
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.000]   in the human heart to be extinguished through torture.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.420]   Finally extinguished, temporarily, yes.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   But finally, irrecoverably,
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.100]   which I think is the basic claim of the book
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.500]   that they break.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.120]   So because through the worst of the torture,
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.520]   Winston gives up Julia, the object of his love.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:10.820]   He says that some things like that,
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.300]   the fact that you said torture her, not me,
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.180]   anything to make this stop,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.380]   the fact that you said that,
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.260]   the fact that you thought that is a statement,
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.060]   is a thought you can't walk back to yourself.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.580]   So it's irrecoverable.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.180]   You just destroyed your faith in love.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.220]   I don't think so.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.820]   I think it's possible we have to remember
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.140]   that this is one particular character.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.800]   This is one particular story.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.960]   I think there's a lot of people in which the capacity
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.800]   to love cannot be broken, no matter the torture.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.660]   But that's an interesting scientific question,
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.820]   but it's also a human question.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.260]   It's just, I think man's search for meaning.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.400]   There's a lot of books that explore this kinds of question
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:59.800]   in the worst of conditions that humans had to suffer through
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.900]   what still persists, what is the source of meaning?
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.300]   And I just think that the flame of love persists
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.520]   through atrocities, through torture,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.380]   through suffering, through all of it.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.060]   But the claim of the book that yes,
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.000]   the totalitarian state can use torture to break even that,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.140]   even that, which leads to the only love you're allowed
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.860]   to have, which is the love for big brother.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.700]   So I think the, practically speaking,
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.320]   from the party perspective,
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.980]   I think the point of O'Brien's torture of Winston
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:43.860]   was to suffocate the hope in his heart
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.860]   in his mind and heart.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.700]   So there is no hope.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.420]   By completely destroying the knowledge
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.340]   of what is and isn't true, so being betrayed,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.660]   and this kind of Goldstein's book about the society,
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.900]   not knowing if that's true,
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.180]   not knowing anything about Julius,
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.020]   basically having no emotional or intellectual ground
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.260]   to stand on.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.260]   It's very difficult to have a sense of where you are.
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.220]   To have hope, you have to have a sense of where you are
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.060]   and where things could be.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.500]   And that, and then you also betray yourself.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.940]   Like to force you to be a hypocrite
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.460]   on your own deepest feelings of love,
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.220]   I think that basically puts you in a place
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.260]   where there's no hope, there's no point.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.580]   It's apathy, it's nihilism.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.740]   And there, a hardworking member of society
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.660]   that is nihilistic is probably what the party wants.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.720]   Because that human will not rebel.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.280]   But on the point of hope,
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.720]   I should mention that there's kind of a long-running theory
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.160]   that since the appendix,
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.120]   the appendix is about the details of newspeak,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.600]   the language that the party is creating and forcing.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.960]   Because that appendix was written in the past tense
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.400]   and it's talking about newspeak in the past tense,
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.560]   and it's written in English, sort of non-newspeak,
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.000]   that means the party and newspeak
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.280]   and all of its elements that we see in the story
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.920]   is in the past.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.960]   That the world from which the book is created
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.920]   has escaped that.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.720]   And that's a message of hope,
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.900]   that whatever the rebellion against the party,
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.200]   whether it's passionate lust and sex,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   whether it's love, whether it's the seeking truth
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.940]   in a world full of lies,
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.880]   whatever it is, there's a way out.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.040]   Again, to me, the way out is love.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.440]   But that's a hopeful message in this dystopian novel
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.840]   that even these perfectly executed
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.600]   totalitarian states will fall.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.760]   I took a few random notes here that maybe I'll comment on.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.840]   I wrote a quote, "The masses cannot rebel
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.640]   "until they become conscious."
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.880]   That might be either a Winston observation
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.440]   or an O'Brien statement, I'm not sure.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.560]   But yes, so you have to think 80% plus
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.760]   are proles of the working class.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.600]   They have the power if they want it,
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.280]   but they don't want it, they don't want to take it.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.000]   That's the whole point of the totalitarian state
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.200]   is to break your will for freedom,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.920]   your desire for freedom,
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.160]   break your ability to know that you're not free.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.200]   And that's where all of it, the changing of history,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.440]   the double think, the thought crime,
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.320]   all of that comes into play.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.680]   The torture in the ministry of love,
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.520]   all of that is about preventing the populace
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.640]   from becoming conscious.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.200]   And again, as per the Sells discussion earlier,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.880]   I wrote down the O'Brien quote,
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.280]   "The death of the individual is not death.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.840]   "The party is immortal."
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.160]   And this is just a interesting observation
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.560]   about the operation of a totalitarian state
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   that it's the idea and a kind of amorphous symbol
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.360]   of the messianic figure and big brother
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.280]   is all you need for the party to persist.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.160]   That person doesn't actually have to exist.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.520]   Any one individual doesn't have to exist.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.760]   It's just the division of society
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.000]   into high, middle, and low,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.240]   and the oppression of the low by the high,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.840]   by the centralized inner party.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.160]   That's all you need.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.040]   And the individual does not matter in that.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   And again, the way to fight that
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.180]   is to fight for the individual freedoms.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:43.200]   Interesting side note is just a quote I wrote down
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.780]   from Julia, I think.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.140]   "If you keep the small rules, you can break the big ones."
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.040]   And so she, in the book,
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.080]   is somebody that follows to the T
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.420]   all the rules of the party.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.960]   She attends all the committee meetings
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.040]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.080]   And just is like the model citizen
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.920]   from the perspective of the party.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.840]   And so that allows her to break the big rules
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.160]   like have passionate sex with people,
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.880]   like the really, or fall in love,
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.440]   all the forbidden things.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.000]   And I think that's actually a good way
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.480]   to exist in the world.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.320]   I think for a lot of us,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.320]   there's probably a bunch of things that bother us
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.640]   in the local world around us, in the bigger world.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.240]   And I think you have to pick your battles.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   You have to not get lost in the mud
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.160]   of small battles.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.400]   If you want to have at least one
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.240]   or a few big victories in your life
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.820]   that make for a better world.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.860]   I think at least in my sense,
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.680]   it's easy to get distracted
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.640]   by the little things that bother you in life.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.400]   And I think staying focused on the big things,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.040]   again, picking your battles
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.680]   and staying with that for as long as possible,
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.000]   working your ass off to solve one problem
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.240]   for as long as possible,
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.840]   not giving up against impossible odds,
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.360]   against all the criticism, all of that.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.160]   That's the way to solve those big problems.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.000]   And of course, that's not what Julia is talking about,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.920]   but in a sense she is also,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.280]   because in that particular case,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.560]   the totalitarian state is the problem.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.440]   And the way to rebel is to plant that seed
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:26.400]   of rebellion in each of the people she has sex with.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.800]   That we're human, that we have lust for each other,
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.280]   that we have the ability to love each other.
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.560]   And that is the necessary act of rebellion there.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.160]   That is the big leap for her at least
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.560]   in that kind of society.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.440]   I should also mention that
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.480]   there's a lot of interpretations of the different,
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.360]   the small and the big things in this book.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.640]   So it's very possible in the case of Julia
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.920]   that Winston was played, he was set up with Julia.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.520]   He was set up to feel all those things.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.520]   He was set up to have that little secret cove
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.120]   where he can write on his desk in the diary
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.880]   and dream of rebelling against the state,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.440]   dream of the brotherhood.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   It's unclear to me why an oppressive state
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.520]   would want people to have that little journey
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.120]   of desiring freedom in all its manifestations.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.000]   But maybe O'Brien's statement that
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.880]   the purpose of torture is torture, hold some wisdom.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:39.860]   That to attain absolute power,
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:46.160]   you also have to have a willingness
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.960]   and a mechanism to attain absolute suffering
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.000]   in the populace.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.420]   And maybe this is a way to maximize suffering.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.440]   It's to give them hope before you crush it.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:08.520]   Again, the way out to me,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.600]   and the takeaway from this book,
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.680]   the way out is love.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.520]   Perhaps this is a good place to also mention
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.400]   a little bit of a fun,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.720]   little controversy that evolved over Twitter.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.040]   So I posted a reading list quickly
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.480]   before heading off to a New Year's party
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.760]   of books that I hope to read in 2023.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   And these are based on books that I asked people to vote on.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.800]   And these are the ones, many of the ones they selected.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.180]   And they happen to be many of the books
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.940]   I've read many times throughout my life and really enjoyed.
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.280]   And they were like old friends that I love visiting
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.600]   and revisiting.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.720]   And every time I read them, I get something new
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.720]   and they're just read different throughout life.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.880]   You know, the way in my teens,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.400]   when I read "The Stranger" by Camus,
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.560]   very different than it was in my 20s
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.880]   and different than my 30s.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.760]   I'll say my favorite book now by Camus is probably "The Plague"
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.240]   and all of that has evolved.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.880]   With Dostoevsky, I read "The Idiot" several times.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.200]   I read "Brothers Karamazov" both in English and Russian,
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.360]   "Nos from Underground."
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.720]   I mean, I loved Dostoevsky.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.540]   And a lot of these books are just,
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:28.240]   yes, they're classics, but they're also deeply profound.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.960]   And they move me on a intellectual level,
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.420]   but also just as a human being.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.880]   They're like travel companions.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.760]   They're like old friends, old to dead friends.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.240]   So yeah, so I was wanting to celebrate my love for books.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.760]   And it was very strange to me that,
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.800]   and if I'm just being honest for a second,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.720]   it was kind of painful that some prominent figures
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.720]   that I respect were kind of cruel about the list
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.000]   and they responded, they mocked it
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.560]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.940]   And basically taking the worst possible interpretation.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:10.940]   And I have to be honest and say it was,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:16.160]   it wasn't fun.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:21.160]   'Cause it was just a silly kid, me,
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.780]   kind of in a joyful New Year's mood,
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.520]   sharing with the world books I love.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:35.360]   And I think what was happening,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.100]   and this seems to be happening a bit more,
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.840]   is there's a bunch of people that are just almost waiting
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.440]   or hoping that I fail,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.520]   or maybe that I'm some kind of bad human being
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.400]   and they're looking, they're trying to discover
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.920]   things about me that reveal that I'm a bad human being
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   and maybe somehow this reading list reveals that.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.120]   I don't know.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.720]   I don't know.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.420]   So one criticism was that everybody read these books
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.080]   in school and they're basic.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.040]   I think my response to that criticism is no.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.960]   First of all, most people have not read them in school.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.120]   Maybe they read Cliff Notes and they're not basic.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.600]   They're deeply profound,
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   some of the greatest words ever written.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:31.020]   But also I don't think I've ever gotten a lot from books
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:34.280]   I was forced to read in school
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.120]   when I had to read them for like an assignment.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.840]   Some of these books I think I read in school,
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.400]   but most of them not.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.720]   But it's only when I read them outside of school
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.560]   on my own volition that I really gained a lot from it.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.120]   And especially throughout my life,
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.840]   regular times as a teenager, as a 20,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.480]   in my 20s and in my 30s.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.980]   So no, these books are profound and deserve returning to.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.560]   And like I said, there are old friends
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.280]   that give me a lot of meaning every time I return
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.440]   to revisit the ideas and give me a new perspective on life.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.720]   Another criticism was very kind of nitpicky.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.560]   And the list was put together really quickly.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.120]   And the goal, I like setting tough goals.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.640]   The goal is to read a book a week.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.240]   And on one week I had Little Prince
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.560]   followed by Brothers Karamazov.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   And people criticized that how can you possibly
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.920]   read Brothers Karamazov in one week?
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.180]   Maybe I won't.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.200]   Maybe I'll fail miserably.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.520]   But I love trying.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.920]   But that wasn't actually the goal.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.800]   I should have said I intend to finish reading it
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.740]   by the end of that week.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.640]   So you start earlier 'cause Little Prince
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.360]   takes an hour or two to read.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.800]   And then Brothers Karamazov, I could have the two weeks.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.560]   It should take about 30, 40, 50 hours to read it.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.800]   That said, friends, I've read it already
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.160]   in English and in Russian.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:04.000]   I'm interviewing the world famous, I would say,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.040]   amazing translators of Brothers Karamazov,
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.840]   of Dostoevsky, of Tolstoy, Richard Perveer,
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   and Larisa Volkonsky probably across multiple days.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.240]   So this book means a lot to me.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.000]   I'm not somebody just kind of rolling in,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.280]   what are the cool kids reading these days?
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.000]   These books have been lifelong companions to me.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.800]   And the fact that people just want to stomp on that,
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.220]   and a large number of people did, people I respect.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   Yeah, I'll be lying if I said it didn't suck a bit.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:42.840]   Anyway, the love for reading persists.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:48.880]   I have to say after that, I was very hesitant
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.820]   to even make this particular video on Orwell in 1984.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.040]   And I'm not sure I want to be public
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.440]   with my reading after this.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.160]   And I know a lot of people will say,
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.120]   no, we're here with you, we're very supportive,
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.600]   and I love you, I mean, I meet so many incredible people.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.120]   But the reality is it does suck to be vulnerable
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.920]   and share something with the world
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.360]   and receive that kind of mockery at scale.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.360]   So I will not be affected or broken
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.220]   by any of that kind of stuff
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.120]   for something that's actually meaningful,
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.680]   like the conversations of some
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.900]   of the very difficult conversations I'm going to do.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.440]   But a silly side hobby thing of reading
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.880]   that I do throughout my life,
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.920]   for that to be a source of mockery,
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.440]   I'm just gonna do that privately.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.520]   So I'm a little torn on that,
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.160]   and I'll try to figure out a way.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.020]   Also, I should say that that list,
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.980]   like a lot of things, is kind of aspirational.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.520]   Because if I take a job at a tech company,
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.460]   or if I start a tech company,
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.860]   or if I have to travel across,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.260]   I have to travel for extremely difficult conversations
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.260]   and really have to prepare for them,
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.500]   all that kind of stuff,
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.220]   I think that's going to affect my ability
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.520]   to both read and enjoy reading,
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.440]   which I think is a prerequisite for this kind of reading.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.400]   But in general, what I do is I read
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.900]   about one hour a day of Kindle,
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.840]   so on the sort of in my eyes physical device.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.440]   And depending on the workout I do and the chores I have,
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.320]   it's going to be about two hours of audiobooks.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.560]   So most of the things I do during chores is audiobooks.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.000]   And when I run, and I usually run about 10 to 15 miles,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.280]   so you're talking about, I often run over two hours,
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.260]   it's like a slow pace.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.280]   Like when the days are not insane,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.520]   it gives me a chance to think,
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.920]   it gives me a chance to listen to audiobooks.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.880]   So I love that process, it's an escape for the world,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.960]   a chance for me to collect my thoughts.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.840]   And yeah, it's again, a source of happiness and joy,
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.320]   and I wanted to share that.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.240]   And I think you can get quite a lot of reading done
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.300]   through that process,
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.760]   especially if it's a book you've read before.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.000]   It is very challenging to do this kind of takeaway video
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.960]   or to concretize your thoughts down on paper,
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.440]   especially when you have to present them in this kind of way.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.720]   I'm not sure I'm going to do that much
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.560]   'cause it's an extra bit of effort,
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.640]   but it's also a chance to share that joy with the world,
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.280]   so to find cool people that also enjoy it,
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.680]   so it's a trade-off.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.520]   Anyway, it's just a temporary thing,
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.520]   but it did suck for a short amount of time,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.440]   for a few hours, for a couple days.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.300]   But in general, I'll persist with my love of reading,
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:40.440]   but I might not talk about it publicly as much.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.160]   But again, let me sort of emphasize
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.360]   that this kind of response and mockery
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:51.820]   will not affect anything of importance that I do.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.180]   Like I always, I try to read comments,
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.260]   I try to see criticism, I really value,
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.340]   especially high effort criticism.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.660]   I try to grow and constantly try to improve.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:09.560]   But that's for things that I take very seriously,
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:13.060]   like the podcast conversations that I do.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:17.340]   But for silly things like book lists,
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.260]   Spotify music playlists,
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.980]   the food I like to eat, I don't know.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.140]   What else? (laughs)
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:30.520]   Anything, any fun side thing, it's not that important.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.480]   If it's something that others don't enjoy, then whatever.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.260]   I'll enjoy them probably with my friends locally here,
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.620]   or the people I meet.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.500]   So anyway, I love reading.
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:43.940]   I love reading classics.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:48.940]   I love returning to old friends in book form
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.900]   and making new ones.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.580]   There's a bunch of science fiction
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.580]   that I embarrassingly have not read and would love to,
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.060]   because those worlds are so meaningful
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.740]   to so many of the people I'm friends with
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.860]   that I can't wait to visit those worlds
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.580]   and sort of make new friends in the form of books.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.980]   So definitely the love for books,
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.020]   the love for reading persists.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.460]   And if you share in that love, that's beautiful.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.660]   So thank you for joining me on this journey.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:20.940]   Thank you for watching this silly little video.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.460]   And I hope to see you next time.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.300]   Love you all.

[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.780]   (upbeat music)
