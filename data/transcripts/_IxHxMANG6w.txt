[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180]   All right, 1 Timothy chapter 3 says this, "I write to you that you will know how one
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.680]   ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.280]   God, the pillar and support of the truth."
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.360]   That's 1 Timothy 3:15, and we should want to know how to conduct ourselves in what God
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.600]   calls his household, his church, and the pillar and support of the truth.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.240]   Knowing how to conduct ourselves in the church includes an examination of how Christ expects
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.220]   his church, his household, to be led.
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.880]   I got to grow up here at Grace Church.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.040]   From my earliest memory, an emphasis in my training was always spiritual leadership.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.740]   Since junior high all the way back a few years ago in the 1970s, men have poured into my
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.360]   life instilling in me the desire not to be an elder, but to be as faithful and effective
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.000]   as I can be, as I exercise my gifts and serve in the church for the strengthening of the
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.700]   church and for the building up of the body of Christ.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.520]   I was given a copy of Spiritual Leadership by J. Oswald Sanders in junior high.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.080]   I don't even remember the man who took me through that book the first time.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.760]   I still have it.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.480]   I still have my notes in the margins of that book.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.240]   It left a mark on me, and that is a book that I've read many, many times since then.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.420]   And I've shared with our pastor how many places I wrote as a junior higher, J. Mack.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.440]   My pastor was an example to me in seventh or eighth grade whenever the first time was
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.040]   that I went through that book.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.840]   The one verse was emphasized over and over and over in that training as just another
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.020]   kid at Grace Community Church, and that verse was 2 Timothy 2.2, "The things which you have
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.060]   heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.720]   able to teach others also."
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.800]   It's a very profound verse.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.600]   In the presence of many witnesses, that happens at the church.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   It's what's happening right now.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.500]   It's what happens on Sundays.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.400]   The things that you've heard, entrust to faithful men so that those faithful men will be able
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.360]   to teach others also.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.640]   The cornerstone of a strong church is faithful men.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   Be a faithful man.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.320]   Follow faithful men.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Lead faithful men.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.200]   That is condensed here in 2 Timothy 2.2, the essence of church leadership.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.000]   The study for tonight reminded me to be grateful for those men that gave me so much.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.720]   The faithful men who in spite of my thick-headedness at times were so faithful to teach me the
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.360]   word, to show me the truth of Scripture by the example of their life.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.960]   This is the gift of the church.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.000]   This is the gift to the church.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Men like that.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.360]   Ephesians tells us that God gives gifts to men, and one of those gifts is all around
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360]   us.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   It's the church.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.920]   And it's our responsibility as faithful men to pass it on through what we say and how
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.780]   we act.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.720]   That in essence again is the definition of church leadership.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Preparation for tonight has also caused me to be reminded of how grateful I am for all
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.160]   of you.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.960]   I know I'm preaching to the choir tonight.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.240]   You're here.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.760]   Many of you make tremendous sacrifices to be here on a Wednesday night.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   Your willingness to carve out time on a Wednesday night away from family and overcome the challenges
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.080]   of work and traffic and everything else to be here.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.920]   Some of you have a wife and kids at home that make a sacrifice for you to be here.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.080]   You get it.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.720]   And I'm so grateful to God for you, and that God is raising up the next generation of male
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.680]   leadership at Grace Community Church.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.560]   You are a trophy of God's grace in that regard, and you're also the fruit of enormous effort
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.480]   by Brad, Klaassen, and your small group leaders.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.360]   You know, some of us might think sitting around a campfire with a bunch of good friends after
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.320]   a day of hunting or fishing or hiking or whatever is the ultimate male experience.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.720]   It's fun, isn't it?
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   I've been there.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.240]   I've done that.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.080]   But I think this group here knows it pales in comparison to a Wednesday night or any
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:07.160]   other time, gathering around the word of God, talking about what really matters.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.560]   Enjoy these days.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.080]   Make the most of these days.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.720]   Make the most of the time you have together in men of the word.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.680]   It is something special.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.240]   The Lord is doing something special in our church through men of the word, and you're
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   part of that.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.980]   The next generation of leadership in the church is being raised up all around you, and I hope
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.600]   that tonight will challenge you, yes, but also encourage you to stay with it and to
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.840]   excel still more.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.520]   Be that faithful man who hears the teaching in the presence of many witnesses who then
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:53.120]   determines I am going to be that faithful man, and I am going to pass it along to others
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.760]   who will then pass it on to others.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.400]   That's leadership.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.920]   So tonight, I want to start our time with an overview of the church.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.660]   If you're to be a leader in the church, you must understand what the church is.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.720]   What is it that you're going to lead?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.880]   The church is one of three institutions established by God, the state or government, family, and
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.320]   the church.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.800]   However, the nature of the church is understated if we leave it with just the description as
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.180]   an institution.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.280]   The church is also and maybe better described as an organism.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.960]   Why do I say that?
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:43.680]   Matthew chapter 16, maybe the foundational verse for understanding the church.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.440]   Jesus says in verse 15, "To his disciples, 'Who do you say that I am?'"
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.160]   And in verse 16, "Simon Peter answered and said, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.520]   living God.' and Jesus said to him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, because flesh and
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.320]   blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.'"
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.360]   And then one of the most packed, profound verses in all the Bible about the church,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.880]   "I say to you," verse 18, "that you are Peter."
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:26.040]   And then it begins a series of words that lays out the foundation of the church.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.540]   Upon this rock, what is the rock?
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.800]   It's not Peter and it's not the Pope.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.660]   It is the proclamation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.600]   That is the foundation of the church.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   On that rock, I, there's ownership, will, there's a promise, build, that's a process,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:04.720]   my, that's ownership, church, that's the purpose, and then there's permanence, and the gates
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.680]   of Hades will not overpower it ever.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.700]   That phrase, "On this rock, I will build," there's a process, it's ongoing, that's why
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.700]   we say the church is an organism.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:29.000]   It is not done being built until Jesus Christ says it's done.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   It is ongoing, continuous, active, it's His church.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.320]   And He's talking about the local church, ecclesia, that's the word He uses, the local
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.800]   gathering of believers.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.680]   So in Matthew 16, Jesus Christ lays out so much profound truth about the coming church,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.600]   and in Acts 2, the church is born, and what I want to do now is to review what we teach
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.380]   about the church, and the reference is in your handout.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.660]   This comes from our doctrinal statement.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.560]   This is just a quick summary.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.720]   It goes on for pages, and I highly recommend it to your reading and to your thought, and
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.640]   to follow through all the passages that are referenced there.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.360]   First, we teach that Christ is the head of the church.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.440]   I just read that to you.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   He's the architect, He's the builder, He's the owner, He created it, it is His, He makes
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.480]   the rules.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.960]   It is by Him, and it is for Him, which leads us to the second point.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.080]   The purpose of the church is to glorify God.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.480]   Preaching Christ and Him crucified, glorifies God, the gospel.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.400]   Guarding and protecting His people inside the leadership of the church, glorifies God.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.160]   Facilitating fellowship, glorifies God.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.740]   God is glorified through communion, baptism, weddings, fellowship, stimulating one another
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.080]   to love and good deeds through service and use of spiritual gifts.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:13.640]   All of that happens uniquely and only in the church, and the purpose of it all is to glorify
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.680]   God.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.280]   Third, church is for Christians.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.800]   If you're saved, you're part of the body of Christ.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.660]   That phrase is used throughout the Bible, and it indicates a deep tissue connection
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.660]   to the head of the church, Christ, and to each other as fellow believers.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.060]   Church is for Christians.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:47.480]   The body of Christ belongs to and consists of those who have confessed with their mouth
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.440]   Jesus is Lord and believe in their hearts that He rose from the dead and they are what?
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.620]   Saved.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.580]   Those who are called by God.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.220]   We are connected to Christ and other Christians.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.180]   And the church discipline process, which Christ laid out in Matthew 18, two chapters later
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:11.380]   in our Bible, highlights the exclusivity of the church, that it is for believers.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:17.780]   And it's starkly clarified in 1 Corinthians 15, 13, those who are outside God judges,
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.140]   remove their wicked man from among yourselves.
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.140]   Church is for Christians.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:30.780]   And by the way, if you are here tonight and you don't know Christ, you are welcome here.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:36.700]   When we say church is for Christians, it takes us to our next point, which is church membership
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.660]   is in the Bible.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.340]   Christians identify with the local church.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.380]   Christians are members of the local church.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:55.020]   Those who don't know Christ are welcome to visit the church, to enjoy events like this
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.420]   at the church.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.620]   But to identify with the church requires that you are saved.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.580]   The church is the vehicle for service and the exercise of spiritual gifts.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.620]   Number five, church membership is active, it is not passive.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:17.420]   It's the exclusive form for service for the building up of the body of Christ and the
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.840]   advancement of the kingdom of God here on this earth.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.420]   Service and the exercise of spiritual gifts of the individual believer takes place in
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:32.700]   the church for the benefit of the church exclusively.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:38.740]   Number six, you saw this in Matthew 16, the church has endured and will survive all attempts
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.980]   to kill it.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.320]   And implicit in the statement that I will build my church and the gates of Hades will
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.020]   not overpower it is that Satan will try.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:58.300]   He has tried, he is trying, he will continue to try and he will always fail.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.380]   That's the church.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:09.660]   Not only will the church survive, it will thrive because Christ is building his church.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:15.900]   And then number seven, Christ has delegated specific leadership authority of the church
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900]   to elders.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.300]   And this brings us to our topic tonight.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.580]   The practice, the polity, and the doctrine of the church is immune from interference
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.580]   by anyone outside the church.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.860]   Elders and pastors are tasked by the head of the church with guarding, protecting, and
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:43.980]   overseeing doctrine, the practice of the church, when we meet, if we meet, and the polity or
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.940]   the leadership of the church.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:53.420]   The primary focus of elders is the ministry of the word and prayer as they shepherd the
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.340]   flock of God.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.940]   Everything else that happens in the church can be delegated while under the oversight
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.100]   of the elders.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:07.020]   And by the way, the word for elder in the Bible is the same word that is translated
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.980]   shepherd, bishop, pastor, overseer.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.060]   Depending on the version of the Bible that you have, those words are all speaking of
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   the same person, the same office.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.660]   So how does a man become an elder?
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.700]   Well, if you have your Bible, turn to Titus chapter 1.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.300]   Titus chapter 1, and I want to walk through pretty quickly the process of how does a man
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.220]   become an elder.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:45.220]   And we have an example in Titus 1, Paul writes to Titus, and he's obviously reviewing with
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:55.020]   Titus what he has already told him because he says in verse 5, "For this reason I left
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.580]   you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.300]   as I directed you.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.980]   Namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.900]   not accused of dissipation or rebellion, for the overseer must be above reproach as God's
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.100]   steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:26.340]   fond of sordid gain, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.900]   holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.900]   be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict."
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:43.940]   Let me walk back through that very quickly because therein the process of becoming an
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.260]   elder is laid out very clearly.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.860]   How does a man become an elder in the church?
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.700]   First of all, he's appointed.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.540]   Did you see that?
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:00.300]   In verse 5, he sent him to set in order what remains and appoint elders.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.420]   Elders are appointed by elders.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:11.600]   And then in verse 6, he talks about the qualification, that you appoint men who are qualified morally
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.900]   in their character and their integrity.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.840]   And you heard me read that.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.060]   And then in verse 7, it talks about how he understands authority.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:31.180]   It says, "For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed."
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:38.560]   It's not his own agenda, but this is a man who's wholly devoted to the purposes of God
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.220]   in his design for his church.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:47.660]   Not self-willed, not with an agenda, but as God's steward.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.860]   And then he's an example to the church.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.980]   It continues, "He's not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:03.200]   of sordid game, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled."
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.020]   That should be a description of the life of an elder.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.020]   And then there's doctrinal purity.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   Verse 9, "He holds fast the faithful word, which is in accordance with the teaching."
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.020]   And not only does he know it and hold fast to it, but he's able to teach it.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:28.140]   "To exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict."
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.960]   That's how a man becomes an elder.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.340]   What about a deacon?
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.700]   The other office in the Bible that is given, there's two offices, elders and deacons.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:49.860]   And if you turn to Acts chapter 6, we see a description of how you become a deacon.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.740]   How does a man become a deacon?
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:59.100]   Acts chapter 6, the first two verses of Acts 6 lays out the problem.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.700]   There's a problem in the church, and the apostles are focused on the ministry of the word and
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.700]   prayer.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.700]   They need help.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:16.940]   Verse 3, "Therefore, brethren, select among you seven men of good reputation, full of
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.140]   the Spirit and wisdom."
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.500]   There's character.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:27.580]   Just like Titus 1, appointing elders, you find men of good character, good reputation,
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.380]   full of the Spirit and of wisdom.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.580]   You find men with ability.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:38.100]   It says in verse 3, "Find men who we can give this task to."
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.100]   And then you appoint men who are satisfied and even joyous in service because their role
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.740]   is to free up the elders.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.300]   It says, "We will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:55.100]   And then in verse 5, you see that the statement found approval from the whole congregation
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.060]   and they chose seven men.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.860]   And then you see that deacons are appointed by elders because it says in verse 6, "These
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:10.700]   they brought before the apostles and after praying, they laid their hands on them."
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.620]   There's a pattern.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.780]   You probably picked up on the pattern, formal leadership, and by that I mean in the offices
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.060]   of elder and deacon.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:26.620]   It requires recognition and appointment by existing godly and biblical leadership.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:34.420]   And that leadership is to look for maturity, proven character in the church and in the
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:41.820]   home, proven leadership, knowledge of doctrine and the ability to communicate it.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.620]   And then a giftedness or an ability that matches the need of the church.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:54.500]   If you aspire to the role of elder or deacon, the qualifications and the process are not
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.900]   complicated, it's not mysterious, and it's not a secret.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:07.400]   In short, your life should be an example and you should already be doing the work.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.980]   And as you do the work, you trust the Lord that if you are to be recognized as an elder
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:19.340]   or a deacon in that role, it will be seen and affirmed by the existing leadership in
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:26.300]   the right time as there is need in the church.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.180]   That's elders and deacons.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.300]   And that's a big picture of the church.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.720]   And now the rest of the time tonight, I want to address the vast majority of men, maybe
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.220]   even in this room, who do not aspire to the office of elder or deacon.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:50.820]   Is leadership in the church only for elders, only for pastors?
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.220]   The resounding answer to that question is no.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:00.340]   The elders have a role, the deacons have a role, but leadership in the church cannot
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   possibly be the exclusive domain of elders and deacons.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.860]   It's not practical and it's not biblical.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.660]   In a healthy, functioning church, there is significant leadership by men who are not
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:20.700]   elders or deacons, and here's why.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.420]   Every Christian man in the church is to lead.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:30.620]   A strong church is full of strong men.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.700]   And to understand the broader concept of spiritual leadership in the church, we need to start
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.460]   at a common point of understanding.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:44.740]   We need to step back now and consider the role of imitation in the church.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.500]   We are all followers.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.260]   This is somewhat of a paradox in teaching on leadership that I'm saying to a room full
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.820]   of leaders that you and I are all followers.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.340]   We're all imitators.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.860]   And if you aren't, you don't get church.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.900]   And maybe you don't understand the realities of the Christian life, and I want to examine
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.020]   imitation very quickly and look at it from a couple different perspectives, and I'm going
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.740]   to go very quickly here.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:22.860]   Your salvation involved a decision to follow.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:29.620]   In Matthew 16, 24, Jesus says to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after me, he must
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.300]   take up his cross, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and what?
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.220]   Follow me."
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.300]   Take up his cross, imitate, follow.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.700]   What about your sanctification?
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.340]   As a believer, as you're striving to become more like Christ, it is over and over and
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.740]   over in the Bible, the principle of the way you do that is to imitate.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:59.580]   Ephesians 5, 1 says, "Therefore, be imitators of God."
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.740]   Imitate God.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:09.840]   Philippians 3, 17, "Brethren, join in following my example and observe those who walk according
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.940]   to the pattern you have in us."
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.540]   How do you follow Christ?
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.940]   You imitate men.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.860]   You follow men.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.300]   First Corinthians 11, 1, Paul says to the church at Corinth, "Be imitators of me, just
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.900]   as I am also of Christ."
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:37.500]   So imitation and following is a necessary ingredient of a leader's life.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.660]   And there's a warning all the way through the Bible, and I just picked out a few examples.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.780]   There is a warning about don't follow bad examples, follow good examples.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:57.300]   3 John 11, pretty clear, "Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good."
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.460]   The implication there is you're going to be an imitator.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460]   Imitate what is good.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.140]   1 Corinthians 15, 33, you know this verse, "Don't be deceived.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:13.460]   Bad company corrupts good morals."
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.540]   Biblical imitation is looking for godly examples and imitating them.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:23.980]   It is not a call to blend in wherever you are by imitating everyone you're with.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.660]   That's dangerous.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:33.500]   We're called to be salt and light, which means actually we're going to stand out.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.500]   Don't be a chameleon.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:40.280]   I provided you a picture of one just to help you out.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.940]   Chameleons are distinctive and highly specialized lizards.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.260]   They are capable of shifting degrees of brightness and color and fitting in with whatever background
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.180]   they're in to fade away.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.540]   That's not what we're called to be.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:02.500]   We are called, biblical imitation is actively and carefully choosing men and then following
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.620]   them as they follow Christ.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.020]   It is a decision.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.060]   All of us are followers and imitators.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:19.740]   Who and what we follow and what we imitate bears itself out in our thinking and our life
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.100]   for better or worse.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.780]   God created us.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.980]   He built us into us.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.540]   He knows us.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:34.620]   Throughout the Bible, there's a dual commentary on imitation.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:41.740]   Imitate godly people, do not imitate ungodly people because we're all imitators.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.420]   What does this have to do with leadership in the church, you might be asking?
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:58.260]   Simply put, church leadership is defined as those men whom others imitate and follow.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.620]   Is it only the elders?
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.300]   It's not biblical.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.540]   It is the elders and it's many, many more in a healthy church.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:15.020]   The gift to the church, to you and me, is men like some of you who consistently model
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:23.740]   truth, strength, and courage and if that's you, you are a leader in the church.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:29.540]   The role of men who lead in the church is to be that man who can say, "Follow me as
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.540]   I follow Christ."
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.100]   He can say, "Imitate me."
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.300]   All of us must be that example that can be imitated, followed, and watched.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.980]   That's biblical leadership in the church.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.100]   The measure of your leadership in the church at the end of days is not the title you had
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.220]   or the office you held.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.900]   The measure of your leadership impact is whether you are that man who made it easy for others
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:03.060]   in the church and those under your care to understand who is Christ and how does he want
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.540]   me to live.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:14.220]   And by following your example are drawn towards greater sanctification to the glory of God.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.820]   You've heard me talk about this before.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.600]   Just drive it home one more time.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.560]   1 Corinthians 16, 13, "Be on the alert.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.720]   Stand firm in the faith.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.040]   Act like men.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.600]   Be strong."
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:39.400]   This verse is best understood under the dynamic of imitation that we've been talking about.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.480]   The explicit command in this verse is to the church, the whole church, "Act like men."
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.760]   Do you see it?
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:55.400]   The implicit command in this verse is to the men and it's profound and it is that you men,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.720]   you and me, we are to be on the alert.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.520]   We must stand firm in the faith.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.400]   We must be strong and courageous.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:11.240]   We need to be the man so that the church can obey the command to act like you and to act
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.600]   like me.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.200]   Imitation.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   It doesn't say act like elders, doesn't say act like seminary graduates, it doesn't say
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   act like deacons.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.640]   They should be able to do all of that.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.240]   What it says is act like men.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   This is you.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.040]   It's nothing flashy.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.000]   There's no titles other than man.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.160]   If you're a man in the church, you must be prepared and equipped to lead by example and
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.360]   to follow.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:29:00.600]   Let's look at a passage, Hebrews 13, 7, and observe what it says to those who lead and
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.960]   to follow.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:11.160]   And I am looking at a room full of men who are called to lead and to follow.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.760]   Both perspectives are relevant.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.440]   Both apply to all of us here tonight.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.420]   All of us are followers regardless of our role in the church and a healthy church is
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.600]   full of men who lead.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.880]   And so in this simple verse, if you look at it from the standpoint of a follower, which
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:35.360]   is who it looks like it's written to, there's obvious commands.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.800]   Remember what does that mean, identify, acknowledge, appreciate.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.040]   Remember those who led you.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:52.600]   Implicit command there to the followers is there are leaders and we must what, follow.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.280]   And then it goes on to explain that.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.780]   They speak the word of God, the command to you and I as followers is we need to sit under
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.780]   that speaking.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.500]   We need to hear that.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.920]   We need to submit ourselves to the preaching and teaching of the word of God.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:14.060]   Second Timothy 2.2, you remember it, the things you have heard among many witnesses.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:19.340]   There are those who speak the word of God and we are to sit under that.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:27.380]   And then the direct command here is to imitate, to watch, observe, take note and imitate.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.820]   That's for all of us.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.900]   What are the commands in that verse to the leader?
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:42.300]   And by the way, the word led is not a direct reference to elders or deacons.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.520]   It includes elders and deacons but it's not exclusive to them.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.340]   It's a reference to anyone who leads in the church and I hope you're understanding.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.460]   You're picking up what I'm putting down here.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.140]   That's you.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.340]   What are the instructions to the leader?
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.060]   First of all, lead.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.620]   Lead.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.620]   Don't shy away.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.940]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.020]   Be faithful.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.740]   Just do it.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.020]   Lead.
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:16.060]   The church is being told to follow your lead.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.400]   Speak the word of God.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:24.900]   Not your personal opinions, not your philosophies.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.980]   Speak the word of God.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.300]   That is what the people of the church need.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.160]   That's why we're here.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.960]   Speak the word of God and then pay close attention to your life because it says, considering
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.580]   the result of your conduct, if you're not paying close attention to your conduct, other
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:48.660]   people are and it matters.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.660]   Be an example.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:56.980]   A couple of verses later in Hebrews 13, verse 17, a verse you've heard before, I'm sure.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.580]   Again, the word leaders here includes you.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.660]   It's not a reference to pastors and elders exclusively.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:09.020]   This verse says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them for they keep watch over your souls
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.220]   as those who will give an account.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:18.260]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief for this would be unprofitable for you."
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.980]   What are the instructions for the followers?
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.160]   Looks like that verse is written to the followers.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.980]   You and me as followers.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.100]   It says we are to obey our leaders and submit to them.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.360]   Some of you get really excited about that.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:41.480]   But if the leader is speaking the word of God, what are the followers really obeying?
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.340]   The word of God.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.280]   That's why it's so important that we speak the word of God.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.440]   And it says in verse 17 that the leaders keep watch.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:59.220]   As a follower, the command there is that you and I are called to be transparent, to allow
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.700]   our leaders to watch over our soul.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.240]   And again, I feel like I'm preaching to the choir tonight.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.720]   This is what you do in small groups.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.560]   It says let them do this with joy and not with grief.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.280]   That is a command to all of us as followers, as members of the church, to not be divisive,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.560]   slandering, undisciplined.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.920]   We shouldn't cause grief and heartache, sorrow, and angst by our lack of obedience, our lack
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.240]   of submission to God's word.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.720]   That is the message of Hebrews 13, 17 to all of us as followers.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.160]   What about the leaders?
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:47.200]   Hebrews 13, 17 has some things to say to the leader.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:53.840]   If the people are called to obey, that means we need to be very, very careful that we are
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.320]   calling people to obedience and submission to Christ.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.640]   We need to speak the word of God.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.760]   It says here that leaders watch over souls.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.720]   We need to remember that we are to be on guard.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.360]   We are to be watchful over the souls of the people that are under our care.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.440]   We're looking out for their spiritual welfare.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.580]   It talks about those who will give an account.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:26.760]   As a leader, you can never forget in the church, don't ever forget your accountability.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:34.200]   You answer to the great shepherd, Jesus Christ, the head of the church.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.840]   It says let them do this with joy.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.160]   Men, as you lead in the church, remember to do it with joy.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:47.120]   It is a pleasure, it's a delight, there's happiness and gladness in that service.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:56.480]   There are hard days, no doubt, but overall, the leader serves with joy.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.680]   So let's review what we've seen tonight and make specific application to you as we wrap
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.300]   this up.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.240]   Before you go to small groups, I'm going to go through what I call a layman's guide to
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.720]   leading in the church.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:16.320]   And this is just a review in case you tuned out through part of what we said.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.720]   First of all, we need to imitate and follow.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.860]   The world or secular leadership gurus would never say that an effective leader should
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:34.760]   always be a follower, that he should be known as someone who imitates others, yet that is
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.600]   exactly what the Bible says.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.480]   In fact, the church leader is exemplary in that.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.800]   He works hard at that.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.840]   Development of leadership in the church is exactly that.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.260]   Again, no mystery.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:55.200]   You want to develop in your leadership in the church, follow a man or men as they follow
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.040]   Christ.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:05.200]   Hebrews 6, 11 and 12 says, "And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.600]   so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you will not be sluggish,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:19.080]   but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promise."
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:27.120]   This verse contrasts sluggishness with imitation.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.580]   Imitation takes purposeful effort and diligent work.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.200]   It produces a sharpening.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.920]   Pick your friends, don't let them pick you.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.040]   Pick your influence.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:48.360]   Pick those men who are going to walk you down the path towards Christlikeness and pick carefully.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.080]   Look wisely.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.560]   Work hard at it.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.880]   Lay leaders in the church are an example of the humility and the curiosity of being a
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.380]   follower and an imitator.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.520]   You get this.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.800]   You're doing it.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.760]   You're here.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.920]   Bear down.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.920]   Work it.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.320]   Look around you.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.960]   It does not matter who you are.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:19.200]   There are men in this room and in our church who can show you, who can explain it to you,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.280]   and who can help you.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.200]   Remember them, it said in Hebrews 13, 7.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:33.720]   That means to identify, note who they are, appreciate them, and follow them.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.600]   Imitate them as they follow Christ.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.960]   The second, in the layman's guide to leading in the church, you want to be a follower,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.220]   an imitator.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.040]   You want to be known for that, but you also want to be biblical.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.040]   Be biblical.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:55.520]   A leader in the church, the true church, is not conflicted about the authority and the
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.480]   application of the Bible.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.800]   He understands Psalm 19.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.980]   Men who lead in the church of Christ know their Bible.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:17.640]   They are convinced beyond any ability to challenge or change that the Bible is true, it is complete,
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:24.880]   it is adequate, it is sufficient, and it is entirely authoritative.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.800]   They are beyond any doubt about the truth or the authorship of the Bible, the Word of
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.480]   God.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.920]   The man who leads in the church knows from Psalm 19 that the Bible is perfect, it is
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:50.960]   sure, it is right, it is pure, it is clean, it is true, it is righteous, it is more desirable
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:58.040]   than gold and sweeter than honey and the drippings of a honeycomb.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.440]   A leader in the church also knows what the Bible does, and Psalm 19 lays this out.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:09.600]   The Bible, it says, restores the soul, it makes wise the simple, it rejoices the heart,
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.480]   it enlightens the eyes, and it endures forever.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.800]   That's the Bible.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:24.120]   May the Lord grant the church men who believe this to their core and manifest this belief
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.520]   in their life.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.720]   A church with men like this does not lack for leaders.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:37.440]   You and I don't have the luxury to let the trained Bible scholars or the appointed elders
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.760]   or deacons or seminary graduates carry this leadership responsibility.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.560]   This is what all biblical men do.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.320]   This is what a healthy church sees in her men.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.920]   This is what you can do and what makes you a leader in the church.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.480]   Church leadership development is the pursuit of knowing how to apply the Bible to real
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:08.080]   life and how to take real life circumstances back to the Bible for answers.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.200]   I'm not telling you you have to get a seminary degree.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.480]   I will tell you that the Bible is within reach.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.200]   It can be read, it can be understood, and it can be applied.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:29.340]   It's amazing, but you have to be committed and able to do that work.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.920]   You know, for the last 18 years or so, every Friday morning I have the privilege of having
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.120]   met with men.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.400]   I think I've had a couple hundred men come through that group.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:47.680]   The whole premise of my Friday morning meetings is there's questions about life and how do
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.040]   we answer the issues of life with the Bible or what there's an issue in the Bible and
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.400]   what does that mean and how does it apply to real life.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.000]   Some men really struggle with that premise.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.440]   They come Friday morning and they hear a question presented and they want to talk about their
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:13.920]   wisdom, their experience, and maybe even the wisdom of somebody else.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.640]   The standard question in response to all of that, and some of you here have been in my
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.080]   Friday morning meetings occasionally, you know that the question is, "Is that in the
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   Bible?"
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.000]   There's a discipline to that thinking.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.120]   Is it in the Bible?
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:39.400]   I deeply respect the men who have come and struggled with that and yet remain under.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:45.440]   They work through that propensity to give non-biblical answers and I've seen them transform
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:52.680]   their mindset to respond to difficulties and confusion with answers from the Bible.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:58.100]   By the way, some have come and they haven't really liked it.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:03.360]   They don't really like having their opinions shut down with some smart aleck guy saying,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.200]   "Wait, is that in the Bible?"
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.200]   And they go away.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.700]   So over 18 years of Friday morning coffee meetings, I've watched the Word of God over
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:25.280]   and over transform how a man thinks, what he thinks, and where he goes for his answers.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.560]   Oh, the Word of God is powerful.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.480]   It's sharper than a two-edged sword, Hebrews 4 says.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.560]   It's able to cut to the bone.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.200]   It has power and authority that you and I will never have.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.800]   The Bible explains God, it exposes the soul, and it gives us hope.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:54.120]   Man, you and I bring nothing to leadership in the church that is any better or more effective
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.240]   than an open Bible.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   We need to be imitators and we need to be biblical.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.780]   Third, we need to pay close attention to our life.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.420]   We need to pay close attention to our life.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.940]   We need to be an example.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.880]   You can be given titles, responsibility, visibility, exposure in the church, and that can all go
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:25.280]   away and what ultimately and always remains is your character and your integrity.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   That is the currency of a true leader in the church.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.360]   First Timothy 4 says take pains with these things.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360]   What things?
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.640]   Well, it refers back to what goes before that verse.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:46.160]   One verse that you know well, First Timothy 4.12 says, "Let no one look down on your youthfulness,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:58.320]   but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity, show yourself as a," what, "example
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.440]   of those who believe."
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.040]   Take pains with these things.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.360]   Be absorbed in them.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.860]   This is Paul writing to a young pastor.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:13.640]   Be absorbed in them so that your progress will be evident to all.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.860]   Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.960]   Persevere in these things, for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.720]   and for those who hear you.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:33.120]   Efforts, sweats, perseverance, it doesn't just happen.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.520]   Moral character, your integrity, maturity, and refining comes from work and the promise
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.740]   is that your progress will be evident to all.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.520]   That is the example that the church needs.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.840]   That's leadership.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.320]   Pay close attention to your life and to your doctrine.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   Persevere.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:01.800]   There's a desperate need in the church for men who can show the way.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:07.500]   I think I can promise you that you have no idea who's watching you.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.120]   There are men watching you.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.080]   There might even be young men watching you that you don't even know.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.280]   You might find out years from now.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.960]   That's a strange experience.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.920]   Be someone they can and they should imitate.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.400]   Those are the people you don't know about.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.240]   What about the people that you do know about?
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.440]   Does your wife imitate you?
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.400]   Do your children imitate you?
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.580]   Can they?
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.040]   Should they?
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.800]   Pay close attention to your life.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.640]   By the way, you can't go home tonight and declare to your home that everyone must imitate
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   you.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.040]   Imitation is earned.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.460]   Some of you have some work to do in that regard.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.840]   Maybe you've destroyed any ability to follow you because of your behavior.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.800]   The long road back on that can start tonight.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:08.980]   Nobody must follow you, but I pray you live in such a way that it would be foolish not
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.720]   to.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.160]   Fourth, and finally, love the church.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.240]   You need to be an imitator and a follower.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.800]   You need to be biblical.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:27.520]   You need to be an example, and you need to love the church.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.720]   I love the church, I think it's safe to say that we need to love what Christ loves, and
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   he loves the church.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.240]   Prioritize what Christ says is important.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:42.320]   If you're going to lead in the church and you don't love the church, you can't lead
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.880]   in the church.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.880]   Love the church.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.840]   Be dependent on the church.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.640]   Hebrews 10 says that your confession is at risk, your steadfastness is at risk, your
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.040]   courage is at risk.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.400]   You need the church.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.480]   I need the church.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.200]   We learned this experientially in the last few years, but Hebrews 10.23 has always said
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.540]   what it says.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:15.040]   Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.000]   And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another in all the
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.360]   more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.600]   That word stimulate sounds wonderful, but what that actually means is to provoke and
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.200]   imitate, or excuse me, irritate.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:42.160]   May you have a great time in your small groups of being provoked and irritated.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   May you enjoy the opportunity to provoke and irritate towards love and good deeds.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.400]   That's what men do.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.240]   That's what the church is.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.880]   You will come to depend on that.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.640]   You must come to depend on that.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.280]   There's also that word encouraging one another.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   You need to excel still more.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.120]   You need that encouragement.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.440]   Others around you need that encouragement.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.360]   That is the dependence on the church that I'm talking about.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:17.800]   Lay leadership in the church needs to be a group of men who imitate others as they follow
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:25.160]   Christ that are biblical, men who are biblical, men who are an example, who pay close attention
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:32.520]   to their life and their doctrine, and they love the church, and they develop a dependence
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.400]   on the church.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:41.040]   Lord, give us more men who want to lead in the church.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:47.240]   A strong church needs strong men, and a strong church is full of strong men.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.920]   Let me pray to close.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.400]   Lord, thank you for your church.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.880]   Thank you for the truth of your word.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.480]   Lord, we've covered a lot of ground tonight.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:02.600]   Lord, I pray that you would prompt in the hearts of each man here what their role might
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:08.200]   be in the church, whether it's as an elder or a deacon, as a small group leader, or just
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:15.640]   as a faithful man who wants to live for you in front of his family and his friends at
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   church.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:23.600]   Lord, I pray that all of this is done not for self-promotion or for the glory of man,
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.000]   but for the great glory of Jesus Christ and the advancement of the church, the building
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.420]   up of the church as you build your kingdom.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.920]   We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
