[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   My name is Josh Ruchites.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   I am your host.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.640]   And today we're going to talk about how you can die broke like billionaire, or shall we
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.000]   say former billionaire, Chuck Feeney did.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.400]   There was a Forbes article published on September 15, 2020 with the headline exclusive, "The
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.840]   billionaire who wanted to die broke is now officially broke."
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.640]   Let me share with you the lead of the story.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.520]   It took decades, but Chuck Feeney, the former billionaire co-founder of retail giant Duty
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.400]   Free Shoppers, has finally given all his money away to charity.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.640]   He has nothing left now, and he couldn't be happier.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.520]   Charles Chuck Feeney, 89, who co-founded airport retailer Duty Free Shoppers with Robert Miller
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.160]   in 1960, amassed billions while living a life of monk-like frugality.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.920]   As a philanthropist, he pioneered the idea of giving while living, spending most of your
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   fortune on big, hands-on charity bets instead of building a foundation upon death.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.200]   Since you can't take it with you, why not give it all away, have control of where it
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.040]   goes and see the results with your own eyes?
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040]   We learned a lot.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.520]   We would do some things differently, but I'm very satisfied.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.960]   I feel very good about completing this on my watch, Feeney tells Forbes.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.720]   My thanks to all who joined us on this journey, and to those wondering about giving while
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.000]   living, try it.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.240]   You'll like it.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.840]   Over the last four decades, Feeney has donated more than $8 billion to charities, universities,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.040]   and foundations worldwide through his foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.680]   When I first met him in 2012, he estimated he had set aside about $2 million for his
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.560]   and his wife's retirement.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.920]   In other words, he's given away 375,000% more money than his current net worth, and he gave
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.240]   it away anonymously.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.040]   And the article goes on, you can find that article at Forbes.com.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.800]   I enjoyed reading this article because there are some things that I think are true or that
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.680]   are right that need to be discussed and often aren't discussed as much as they should be
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.760]   in financial circles, especially in the circles of estate planning and what do you do with
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.920]   your money when you are dead and gone.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.600]   And so I want to share with you some ideas for you to think about because it is a responsibility
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.400]   that we all have.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.320]   If we think about that final stage of finances, financial abundance in my seven stages of
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.680]   financial freedom, if you think about that, what do you do when you have more than enough?
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.720]   You're going to have to figure out what to do with the excess.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.040]   Now I'm intentionally using words and language around money that can be adjusted based upon
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   your unique circumstances.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.840]   For some people, more than enough might be a very big number.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.080]   For other people, more than enough might be a rather modest number.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.160]   You're the one who has to decide what is enough in your personal circumstances.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.400]   But if you live and behave in a frugal way, if you live in a responsible way, you earn
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.920]   more than you spend, you save, etc.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.520]   Chances are you're going to have more money than you can spend.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   And I think that within the audience of radical personal finance, this is going to be more
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.520]   common than not because most of us who are building wealth, we're not exclusively building
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.400]   wealth with the simple goal of making just enough for us to live on and then quit.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.600]   Most people don't have that as their cornerstone of their financial plan.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.800]   Now if you did want to, you could do that.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   And today's show, we're going to have three parts in it.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.660]   Number one is just simply a quick conversation on Chuck Feeney and what he did.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.320]   Number two, we're going to talk about conceptually what you should do.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.560]   Perhaps you're not yet a billionaire.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.960]   These concepts still apply to you.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.440]   And then in the third part, we're going to talk about the nuts and bolts of financial
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.440]   considerations.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.080]   And really how can you do this with some of the financial tools that are available to
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.320]   you depending on what your personal goals are.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.560]   But I want to point out that if your personal goal were simply to accumulate enough money
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.720]   that you could live on for the rest of your life and to die completely broke, you could
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.800]   do it.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.920]   Probably your simplest way to do it would be to earn money and then to buy some annuity
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.640]   contracts from insurance companies and those contracts would give you a guaranteed payout
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.320]   for your entire lifetime.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.820]   They would go until the date of your death.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.060]   And when you die, your money streams will die as well.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.800]   That would be the most efficient way to guarantee that you spend as much as you possibly can
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.280]   during your lifetime and that you die broke.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.040]   This is far more efficient even than the common idea of building a portfolio of stocks and
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.360]   then withdrawing from that at 3 or 4 percent, be much more efficient to use annuities in
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   this context.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.520]   We'll talk about that towards the end of the show.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.840]   But you could do this as well and you could just set the goal that I'm going to earn just
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.220]   enough money to cover my needs and I'm going to spend it all.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.280]   But most of us are not just working to earn money to provide for ourselves.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.600]   Most of us are working to earn money to provide for others that we care about.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.840]   We're also working because it's a lifestyle that we've chosen.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.720]   I personally think that our work is one of the best ways that we make a contribution
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.080]   to the world.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.400]   That work may or may not be remunerated financially, but we will continue to engage in work because
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.440]   it's one way of contributing to the world.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   It's a way of making the impact.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.640]   And I think most of us have a desire to make an impact that will outlive us.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.920]   And so there are different ways that we do that.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.360]   It might be as simple and commonplace as seeking to impact our children and our children's
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.000]   children and descendants down the road.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   That's probably not going to result in financial gain, but it certainly will impact the world.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.540]   It might be simply trying to help our neighbor or as is a good example with Chuck Feeney,
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.440]   it might be seeking to help people all around the world and invest billions of dollars into
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.660]   high impact activities.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.440]   You get to choose how you do it, but there's a good chance that your work will involve
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.960]   money in some way or other, some way of making money.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.000]   So let's talk about some of the lessons that we learned here with Chuck Feeney's story.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.320]   I think the first big lesson is to recognize that you can't take it with you.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.980]   That's what Chuck clearly says in this story.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.600]   You can't take it with you.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.920]   There's an old quip that I used to hear motivational speakers talk about and they would go something
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:44.380]   like this, "How much money will Bill Gates leave behind when he dies?"
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.960]   Same as you and me, right?
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.920]   Exactly the same, which is all of it.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.760]   When we are dead, all of the money is no longer ours.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.120]   None of it goes on ahead.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.620]   I don't think that really most of any of us have much aspirations to do some of the things
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.820]   that past generations of human beings have tried to do to affect the afterlife with money.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.940]   Now there are some cultures, particularly Eastern cultures, that have a cyclical view
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.380]   of life where they feel that life is always coming and going.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.820]   That's of course very common in Eastern religions.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.360]   Most of us in the West, we have a direct view of time.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.120]   Time began at one point and it moves forward.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   And once we're dead, we're dead.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.420]   We're dead and gone.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.000]   Now perhaps some people might want to build a large mausoleum, but I've never met anybody
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.140]   who shares a belief that perhaps the Egyptians shared that they should build a pyramid to
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.980]   entomb us or fill our tombs with fruits and vegetables and seeds and jewels and things
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.780]   to take into the afterlife.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.540]   About the best you'll see at this point in time is you might see somebody have a big
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.460]   fancy headstone in the cemetery and maybe a statue gets put up somewhere of you.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.300]   But at the end of the day, once you're dead, all of the money stays behind.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.380]   No money goes from this life into your next life.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:19.340]   And so in that context, it's valuable and important to realize that because if you realize
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.700]   that it puts a lot of things into focus.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.060]   It puts a lot of things into priority.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.700]   As I want to say, money is the ultimate renewable resource.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.500]   There's an unlimited amount of it available.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.940]   There's an unlimited amount of it available to you.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.620]   And so it's always renewable.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.980]   Whereas time is the ultimate non-renewable resource.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.140]   It's finite.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.180]   It's specific.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.860]   It had a beginning and it will have an end.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.020]   And you had a beginning and you had an end.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.540]   And so you're balancing these aspects of time versus money.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.020]   It's an important pressure that you're going to face throughout your lifetime.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.620]   And so it's good to begin with the end in mind, especially with money.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.340]   It's good to recognize that at the end of my life, when I die, all of the money stays
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.340]   here.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.500]   So how am I going to use it most effectively for myself?
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.000]   That's the first lesson I think we can draw from Chuck Feeney's example.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.400]   Another important lesson is that different people will value different things.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.620]   In other articles, Feeney is said to live in a modest San Francisco apartment.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.940]   Evidently, the quip was that he had inkjet printed pictures in his office, which seems,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:38.380]   I don't know, I think unnecessary, excessively, excessively, what word to use?
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.660]   I don't want to say monk-like, but I don't have inkjet printed pictures in my house.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.140]   I have proper pictures.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.980]   And I think that that's certainly a reasonable thing.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.620]   But when people share these anecdotes, they're trying to emphasize that this is not somebody
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:56.140]   who is obsessed with a certain way of living.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.820]   Now I would bet, I don't know anything other than about Chuck Feeney.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.820]   I've never met him.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.620]   I don't know any personal, I don't know anybody who knows him.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.980]   The only thing I know about him is three or four articles that popped up in the news search
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.980]   after the Forbes article was written.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.740]   Prior to reading these articles, I knew nothing about him.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.940]   I'd never heard of him.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.340]   I just read these basic articles that are all rewritten versions of the same very few
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.580]   facts.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:29.100]   However, I would bet that these displays of hyper frugality are probably exaggerated.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.820]   The adjective that was used was monk-like to refer to his lifestyle.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:40.180]   In my observation and experience, I think these are very excessively exaggerated when
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.220]   people talk about how frugal wealthy people are.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.340]   I believe there are genuinely some people who are very wealthy and who are intensely
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.340]   frugal.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.740]   And of course, we all have the right to live how we like.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:58.180]   But a lot of the stories that are told about people's frugality, really, they become, are
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.180]   they fake?
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.180]   Are they made up?
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.780]   Not necessarily, but they don't take the whole picture.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:07.620]   So I guess famously, you know, Warren Buffett's Cadillac that Warren Buffett drives to work.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.780]   And famously, he had his Cadillac that was several years old and he could afford to drive
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.060]   a Bugatti, but he just chooses to drive a Cadillac.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.260]   And this is meant to be inspirational to you and me.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.940]   And there's an element of truth to it.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.140]   There's an element of truth to say that, "Hey, Warren Buffett drives a Cadillac.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.620]   Why do you and I need to have a fancy car?
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.860]   A Cadillac, we can go get the same Cadillac that Warren Buffett drives."
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.740]   There is an element of truth.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.020]   There's an element of truth to the fact that Sam Walton drove an F-150, right?
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.180]   It's true.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.140]   But on the other hand, there is an element where it ignores a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.140]   Warren Buffett owns, I don't know how many, but a half a dozen properties all around the
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.140]   world.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.740]   Warren Buffett flies in a private airplane anywhere he goes.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.720]   Warren Buffett's family lives very, very well and spends a lot of money.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.700]   And so he might have this personal quirk of having driven for a number of years a gold-colored
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:08.100]   Cadillac, but that is not in any way indicative of the idea that somehow he lives on a $50,000
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.340]   a year salary.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.420]   That's silly.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:17.040]   And so the similar thing I would say with Mr. Feeney is that I would bet maybe he did
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.420]   set aside $2 million for his retirement.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.400]   Maybe he does live in a modest San Francisco apartment.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:29.500]   Maybe as a personal individual, he might enjoy living very modestly and frugally.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:37.100]   But most people who are billionaires could continue to live like a billionaire even if
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.340]   they had $2 million to their name simply due to their connections, due to their influence,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.740]   and due to the circles that they run in.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.620]   In the same way that if your brother has a nice boat and you have a good relationship
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.060]   with your brother and he lets you take the boat out anytime you want to take it out,
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.980]   then you can have that same kind of relationship among wealthy people.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.340]   So I would doubt that Mr. Feeney drives.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.340]   If he flies somewhere, I doubt that he flies commercial, right?
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.580]   He'll hitch a ride with one of his buddies or he'll borrow somebody's plane.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.380]   It's just not fair.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:15.580]   Generally speaking, it's not fair to say, "Well, look, this guy was a multibillionaire
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.540]   and he just lives in this tiny apartment, so therefore you can and you should too."
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.220]   Billionaires live a very nice lifestyle.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.140]   Now once they reach a certain age, of course they change and they may not find so much
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.140]   joy in jet-setting around the world.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.980]   They might find more joy in sitting and living a more tranquil life.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.780]   But he doesn't live a penny-pinching life.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.500]   But what I think is important, so with that caveat, which I think it's important to identify
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.420]   when we read these stories about hyper-wealthy people.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.780]   With that caveat, however, it is valuable to learn from his example that he doesn't
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:58.540]   seem to gain pleasure from the status consumption-oriented things that many other people do.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.420]   He doesn't gain pleasure from developing and having a house full of supercars.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.860]   He doesn't gain a garage full of supercars.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.780]   He doesn't gain pleasure from saying, "Yes, I own 10 yachts all around the world."
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.860]   He doesn't gain pleasure from a lot of those things.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.540]   Evidently, he gains pleasure from living fairly simply.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.980]   Now for me, this lesson is something that has always rung true for me, especially at
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.340]   different phases of life.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.020]   But when I look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous, when I look at many of the large
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:35.020]   consumption items that people engage in, a lot of them seem to me to just simply add
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.620]   more trouble to your life than it's worth.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.060]   A number of years ago, I heard an anecdote.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.220]   I don't know if it was apocryphal or not, or even where I heard it, but it was just
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.860]   the conversation about a rich guy who was having a house built in Florida.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:56.980]   He was standing on the tarmac in New Jersey about to board his private airplane.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.300]   Arguing with the contractor who was building his multi-million dollar mansion in Florida
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:07.420]   about how it had to be just so, and this had to be done, and that had to be done, etc.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.900]   And he thought, "Why am I doing this?
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.580]   I'd rather stay here and hang out on the weekend and not have to go deal with a new
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.580]   house."
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.260]   And what I took from that personally was just the basic idea that possessions can own you,
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:25.620]   your stuff can own you, and it can be really annoying to have all this fancy stuff.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.020]   I understand that some people enjoy it, and I think that you're right to spend your money
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.540]   how you enjoy, but I think that a lot of times some of the stuff that you buy because you
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.300]   think it's going to be awesome may actually not be awesome for you.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   And each person will have to think carefully about where that line is that they need to
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   draw.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.900]   But having six mansions all around the house can be annoying, can be frustrating.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:56.860]   And having 20 bedrooms in your house might not be as fulfilling as you want it to be.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.680]   After all, you can only be in one bedroom at a time.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.540]   And so when I think about being an older man and I think about living in a modest place
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.740]   that's in a place that I like, I don't mind at all living in a modest place.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.600]   And I would find it annoying.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.660]   I would rather live in a small apartment that I liked with a great view and a place that
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.660]   I liked being.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:22.060]   I would rather do that than have to deal with the care and upkeep of a 50-room mansion myself.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.780]   Now, your mileage may vary.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.220]   You may decide differently, and that's your right.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.560]   But I think it's useful to note that there are many, many people who become wealthy who
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.240]   don't give themselves over to excessive flashy consumption.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.720]   And I think it's also valuable to note that that consumption can be often met, those consumption
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.420]   goals can often be met in a way, in a time that doesn't require them to control your
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.420]   life.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.120]   You can rent a beautiful place, right?
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.160]   You can rent a lovely yacht.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.260]   And going and renting a big multi-million dollar yacht for a couple of weeks and chartering
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.780]   it for a few hundred thousand dollars is probably going to be simpler and just as fulfilling
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.280]   for you to do what you wanted to do rather than to have to deal with the hassle and the
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.740]   upkeep of that yacht all the time.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.740]   So recognize that there are many billionaires who don't engage in that flashy consumption
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.080]   lifestyle, high consumption lifestyle.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.860]   And so you might or might not be interested in that consumption lifestyle.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:27.680]   I think that Mr. Feeney's example with regard to giving the money away while he's alive
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.740]   is one of the most powerful things that we can do, especially if we want to make sure
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.520]   that the money goes to causes that you believe in.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.460]   It's dangerous for you to set up a giant foundation that's just going to be funded after your
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.400]   death and is dangerous for a number of reasons.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.440]   Number one, you may have a certain ideology.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.880]   You may have a certain thing that you want to contribute money to.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.180]   You want to adjust.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.880]   You want to make a difference in the world.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.420]   But it's probably going to be difficult for you to make sure that everybody who's controlling
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.780]   your money will do that for the long term.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.020]   It's one of the things that's so difficult to do.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.920]   Once you're dead and gone, you're dead and gone.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.860]   Now there may be some legal constraints that you can adjust.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.540]   There may be some things that you can make happen when you are dead.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.500]   You might be able to write certain things into your trust.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:28.560]   But if you look at any kind of institution, institutions tend to stray at least modestly
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.300]   and often very, very significantly from the intent of their founder.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:41.900]   I think the best examples would be to look at the big old revered college institutions
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.660]   in the United States.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:49.460]   Many of these historic universities, Yale, Harvard, many of the Ivy League universities,
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:55.700]   they were started, for example, and founded and funded by people with a very clear religious
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:04.060]   agenda, a very clear religious goal that they wanted to achieve, with a clear set of morals
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.900]   and ideas.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.860]   Well if those people were to come back and see what those schools stand for now, it's
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.740]   hard to imagine they would be happy with what those schools are doing with the money that
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.420]   they originally contributed to them.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.320]   And if you look at many other more short-lived foundations, you'll see that.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.500]   Especially within a generation or two, if you look at a foundation, it's hard to see
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.520]   a foundation that doesn't stray from the intent of its founders.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.760]   It's also hard to find a foundation that doesn't become bloated and somewhat bulky.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.460]   A big pot of money that's just left there after your death is going to be a target for
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:49.200]   people who want to go and help themselves to some of it.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.700]   And when you're around most foundations, many foundations could be dramatically improved
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.780]   in terms of their efficiency, in terms of their productivity, etc.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.060]   And they become wasteful.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.060]   In addition, it's hard for a foundation to balance a dual-fold mandate of investing for
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.040]   a financial return and then giving.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.100]   And this can be very difficult if you decide to establish a foundation that you want to
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.300]   last for generations, for centuries.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.700]   If you are going to leave $500 million behind to a foundation, and that foundation is trying
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.560]   to invest for growth but then give money away, the question is how much should they give?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.740]   If they give away 10% of their assets per year, then this foundation is not going to
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.480]   continue for generations.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.140]   On the other hand, if they only give away 2%, well then it just becomes bigger and bigger
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.140]   and bigger.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.640]   And are they accomplishing the mandate?
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.980]   And so in the same way that on a recent Friday Q&A where we were talking about the balance
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.240]   between giving and investing for yourself, and I gave a very wordy answer talking about
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.600]   how it's a really hard thing to decide, the same thing applies to foundations.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.800]   How do you balance this investing versus giving?
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.700]   And then what's more is how do you balance the ethics of a foundation and what they invest
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.060]   their money in?
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:16.140]   Perhaps you establish a foundation and you say, "Our goal is to make sure that we give
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.100]   money to this social cause over here."
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.280]   But then you're investing your money into companies that are actively working against
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.420]   that social cause.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.340]   This happens all the time and it's hard to do.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:36.540]   In addition, the skills of giving away money and the skills of making money grow are only
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.140]   rarely found in the same person.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.860]   You may be able to hire an investment expert who is able to successfully manage a portfolio,
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:51.140]   but that investment expert may have known nothing about successfully giving money away.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:56.180]   So can you create a team where you have an investment expert and you have somebody who's
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.340]   skilled at giving money away?
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.460]   You certainly can, but then there's going to be a built-in tension.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.780]   And I think that if you approach something the way that Mr. Feeney did, where he had
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:13.060]   a goal of basically over four decades, 40 years, to give the money away, all of the
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:20.940]   money in 40 years, then now you can come back and your answers and your questions become
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.220]   simpler.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.640]   The solutions become simpler to these fundamental financial problems that you face.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:33.980]   He evidently built his wealth by building businesses, but then he decided he was going
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.040]   to give it away.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.460]   And so he didn't give any effort to saying, "Can I start another business and grow a bigger
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.460]   fortune?"
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.460]   He said, "I'm going to give it away."
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:46.320]   And so he gave a lot of money to big causes trying to make a big difference.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.340]   According to one article, his most notable donations include a $62 million grant to abolish
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   the death penalty in the United States, a $76 million grant for grassroots campaigns
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.660]   supporting the passage of Obamacare, and nearly $1 billion in gifts to his alma mater, Cornell
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:08.420]   University, including the $350 million development project in 2012 to build a Cornell Tech campus
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.680]   on New York City's Roosevelt Island.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:19.860]   And so you see that he's trying to make big impact with big dollar contributions to causes
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.220]   that he cares about.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.260]   And so as he's giving the money, since he's not trying to keep anything in reserve, he
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.900]   can make big contributions.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:36.740]   I like this because it gives you the ability to possibly make a difference in a few areas.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.180]   And there's a lot to be said about his style of giving.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.700]   I'm sure in the philanthropy magazines they're going to be analyzing his successes and his
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.900]   failures for quite a while.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:51.620]   But I wanted to point out that it's good because it solves this problem of how do you balance
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.060]   giving versus investing.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:58.900]   You set a short timeline and you say, "I'm going to give this away as quickly as I can."
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.980]   And in his case, he was able to do it in 40 years.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:06.860]   I think it's fascinating though to realize how hard he had to work in order to actually
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.940]   give the money away.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.700]   According to the news reports, at its height, the Atlantic Philanthropies, his foundation
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:19.420]   that he'd started, had 300 plus employees and 10 global offices across seven time zones.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:28.860]   So he had to work hard to build a large foundation to actually successfully give the money away.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.060]   One of the things that is very daunting to people when they accumulate significant wealth
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.020]   is they want to give the money away, but it's very hard for them to do so in any way that's
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.820]   going to actively generate a big impact.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.700]   And so it just seems easier sometimes to ignore it, to set up a foundation that's going to
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.700]   get the money when you're dead, and then to move on with your life.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.900]   It's very, very challenging.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.780]   There was a report written, the final report, Atlantic Philanthropies, I'll link it in today's
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.700]   show notes as well that I think you'll enjoy, but they did list out the top 10 grantees,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:09.660]   which were Cornell University, $965 million, University of California, San Francisco, $636
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:16.900]   million, University of Limerick, $181 million, Trinity College, Dublin, $168 million, Stanford
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:24.100]   University, $145 million, the Rhodes Trust, $134 million, Queens University of Belfast,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.460]   $132 million, Dublin City University, London School of Economics, and the Cork University.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:34.980]   So the top 10 grantees are all educational institutions.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:41.620]   And so I think that's interesting because what you often see is you often see that wealthy
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.340]   people choose to patronize educational institutions.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:50.940]   And I scratch my head at this a lot, for me personally, just from an ideological perspective.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.900]   I often scratch my head.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.580]   And the reason I wanted to point this out though is that this does make the difference.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.660]   This changes what I said about giving the money away while you're alive so that you
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.560]   can see that it has an impact and you can control it.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.820]   Because when you go to build these universities, endowments, and institutions, they still are
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.340]   subject to all the things that I said about a board.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.060]   So you want to be careful about that.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.220]   But it is interesting to note that it wasn't as though he was trying to see all of the
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.260]   work done while he was alive.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:26.460]   It was, however, that he was giving the money to – that he gave it away personally while
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.700]   he was alive, but he's still giving it to some institutions that are going on for a
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.180]   significant amount of time.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.980]   So those are the basic lessons that I wanted to draw from what Chuck Feeney did.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.540]   And now let's talk about you.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.060]   Chances are your wealth is a bit more modest than $8 billion or $10 billion or whatever
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.200]   Feeney started out with.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.620]   We have a lot of multimillionaires in the radical personal finance community, but I'm
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.000]   not yet aware of any billionaire listeners.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.740]   And so what do you do as a multimillionaire who's trying to figure out what you do with
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.740]   your money?
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.820]   I think the first thing you got to do is you got to think through your personal philosophy
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.340]   of what you would want to do, what impact you want the money to have.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:20.360]   The most common thing that most of us look at is we want to help our children.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.560]   We want to endow our children with wealth.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.080]   Now, not everybody marries, not everybody has children, of course, but many of us do.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:32.120]   And for those of us who do have children, that's very high on our list.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.900]   According to Mr. Feeney's Wikipedia page, Feeney is married twice.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.400]   His first wife, Danielle, is French.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   They have $4, Juliet M., Caroline A., Diane V., Leslie D., and one son, Patrick A. His
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.680]   second wife, Helga, is his former secretary.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:54.960]   So I don't know anything, I didn't find anything about what Feeney has done for his children.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.640]   But I would imagine that he has passed on significant wealth to his children.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   I'm just guessing.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.160]   I could be guessing wrong, but it would be unusual for somebody not to want to help their
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   children.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:13.800]   I think the most famous quote here would come from Warren Buffett's work in the biography
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.400]   Snowball, which I read a number of years ago.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.120]   He talked extensively about his goal with his children was to leave them enough money
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:25.240]   to do anything, but not so much money that they could do nothing.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.500]   And I think that in some ways that's a reasonable approach to have, leave them enough money
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.640]   to do anything, but not so much that they can't do anything.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   But I think what people often get at this wrong is they often wait too long to give
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.580]   money to their children.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.880]   One of the annoyances that I've always had about this type of planning is that if you
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.920]   wait until you die to pass along financial wealth to your children, they probably won't
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.120]   need it.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.400]   And or if they do need it, they probably won't have been able to get as much joy from the
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:01.720]   money, as much benefit from the money as if you had passed it along when they were younger.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.840]   So I had my first child at the age of 27.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   And if I think about my expected lifespan, right, for years I've always said my plan
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.240]   is to die in a motorcycle accident on my 100th birthday.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.720]   Well, at this point in time, I'm starting to go beyond 100.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.880]   My grandmother just turned 106.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   And so at this point, I'm moving my timeline out to, I don't know, maybe I'll aim for 120,
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.920]   130, something like that.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   But let's just say that I trim down those numbers and I say something like 90 years
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.920]   old, right?
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.880]   Let's pretend that I die at a common age of 90 years old.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.680]   Where are my children going to be at that point in time?
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:46.760]   Well, my eldest child, if I died at 90, my eldest child would be 63 years old.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.520]   If my eldest child had a baby at 27, then my grandchild, my eldest grandchild would
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.760]   be 36 years old.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.080]   And so you think about transferring money to someone who is 63 and you ask yourself,
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.720]   well, what does a 63-year-old need more money for?
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.080]   By 63, you're probably, the course of your life is probably pretty well established.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:15.680]   In my experience, most people who are responsible, you know, 63-year-olds, they've established
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   most things.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.520]   Not to say that they're necessarily rich or not rich, but they've established their lifestyle.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.420]   And the needs for money that a 63-year-old has are fairly modest compared to the needs
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.000]   for money that perhaps a 30-year-old father might have.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.080]   Right now, I have a higher need for money than I'll probably have at any other point
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.280]   in my life because of my children.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   I have young children.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   The children are not financially productive.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.940]   They're a drain on the family finances.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.320]   We invest into the children heavily.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.480]   There's a whole lot of infrastructure that goes with it.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   You need a larger house.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.200]   You need a larger car.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.640]   You're spending money on activities.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.760]   You're spending money on teachers, on coaches, on things.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.980]   You're spending money on activities with them, even just fun activities.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:03.100]   If I go skiing, it's not hard to spend $10,000 in a week if I take my family snow skiing
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.480]   because of the sheer number of lift tickets that I have.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.140]   It's much easier to enjoy those active, expensive type of expenses when you have children that
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.380]   are financially dependent on you versus when you are older.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.800]   If I go somewhere, I need two hotel rooms.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.460]   If I'm buying airplane tickets, I'm buying them six at a time.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.180]   The financial costs are significant.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.900]   On the other hand, when I'm 63 years old, the financial costs are likely to be far less
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.900]   significant.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.900]   There will be two of us rather than six or more.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.420]   Life will be simpler.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.760]   It's not to say that people can't spend a lot of money.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.700]   It's just that the time when the spending feels the most required is when you have younger
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.780]   children, when you have minor children.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.480]   Older people or wealthy people can easily spend a lot of money.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.420]   We can go out and have a dinner for two that costs $400 at a nice restaurant on Palm Beach
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.940]   or in New York City or wherever you like to go.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.980]   It's not hard to have a $300 or $400 dinner.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:18.140]   But that same couple could just as easily go and have a very enjoyable $25 dinner at
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:23.340]   a lower cost place and enjoy the experience of being together every bit as much as they
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.580]   can enjoy the $400 dinner.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:32.220]   On the other hand, if you have a family with four children, it's much more difficult to
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:38.100]   make a $25 dinner happen with a family with four children for six people than it is for
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.100]   two.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.380]   The point is not that older people or wealthier people can't spend a lot of money.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.540]   They can.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.940]   But it's a lot harder to get away with those things when you are younger.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.540]   I mean at this stage in our family life, if I want to take my wife out, there are the
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540]   expenses.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:58.020]   There are obviously the expenses of taking children out, which we're very fortunate to
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.600]   be able to do.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.660]   But there are the expenses of taking children out and/or even if just the two of us want
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.220]   to go out, there are the expenses of a babysitter.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.300]   It's just life is more expensive.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.100]   So if you're looking for a time when it makes sense to give your children money, I'm of
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.660]   the opinion that it makes sense to give them money earlier.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.100]   That it makes sense to give them money early when it's useful to them.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.660]   Now I've talked about, and I'm going to have a couple of shows coming down the pike this
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.480]   week or next, about how to do that.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.300]   But even with regard to education, I've tried to promulgate the idea that money that you
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:36.500]   want to spend on your children's education is best spent when they are young.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:42.140]   And so most things, when you spend the money earlier, in most things it can be spent better.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.620]   I spend a lot of money on books for my children to read.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.380]   I spend a lot of money on education, on experiences for them.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.820]   But I'm convinced it's better for me to invest in them now when they're young than to wait
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.780]   until they're 18 and then to buy some mythical college degree that's going to solve all the
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.780]   problems.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.900]   If I do my job now, in the first five to ten years of their life, they'll never need a
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.740]   dime from me for the rest of their life.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.100]   And they won't ever need a dime from me for a college degree.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:13.420]   The college degree can be easily self-financed in any number of ways if I do my job now.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:19.260]   But if I don't do my job now, then down the road that college degree may have some influence
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.740]   on them, possibly, but probably not a huge influence on them.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.220]   So let's talk about expanding out beyond just education.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.340]   Because of course, wealthy parents will invest huge amounts of money in their children's
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.900]   education, as we should.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.340]   It's a good investment.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.380]   But what about other things?
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.220]   Things like buying houses for your children.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.020]   Well, when's the best time to inherit a house?
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:44.860]   Is the best time to inherit a house when you're 65 years old and you are trying to figure
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.460]   out, you know, you just, "Oh, okay, dad died and he left me this house."
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.580]   Well, by 65, you've probably already got a house that you're living in that's probably
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.580]   reasonable enough for you.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.780]   And you've probably already got a house.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.940]   It's probably already paid off, right?
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.580]   It's not hard to buy a house and have it paid off by 65.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.260]   On the other hand, if you inherit a house when you're 30, that probably makes a much
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.860]   bigger difference for you.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.380]   To inherit a house when you're 30 is a time when you have all those kid expenses.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.400]   And so if you have a debt-free house that dad gave you, now maybe you can afford to
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.100]   take your children to Europe every year.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.500]   Now maybe you can afford to make the private school tuition payments into your children's
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.540]   lives.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:27.620]   And since that's probably when you're at your more modest earning years, it makes a lot
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.380]   more sense.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.340]   Let's talk about the career for a moment.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.460]   This is another big thing that if you look at a 63-year-old, there's a very good chance
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.580]   that a 63-year-old is in the highest earning years of their life.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.240]   Not always, but very good chance.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.900]   And so you have low expenses and high earnings.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.620]   Whereas many 30-year-olds are still trying to figure out how to keep their head above
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.060]   water, how to figure out their career.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.240]   They've been bouncing around.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   Maybe they went to college.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.300]   Maybe they're still trying to figure out, "What do I want to do?"
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.820]   It's unusual for a 30-year-old to be earning a lot of money, but it's much more common
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.080]   for a 63-year-old to be earning a lot of money.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.980]   And so having extra money from mom and dad can be very helpful at that early age because
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.540]   it allows the 30-year-old to live bigger experiences, to do nicer things.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:16.220]   It really enhances the lifestyle of the younger person in a way that it doesn't have the same
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.980]   percentage effect for an older person.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:26.700]   Money and income can also be helpful when somebody is younger because it may allow them
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:33.980]   to go in an area that has more long-term value because there's a delayed gratification.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.020]   Let's say that you have a wealthy father and the wealthy father says, "Here, I'm going
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:43.500]   to give you a house and you have a house to live in," and that allows you as a young 30-year-old
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.460]   to take a job that is a better fit for you but earns less money.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.820]   Well, you have less financial pressure so you can do that.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:53.580]   That's going to pay off bigger over the long term than working a job that pays you more
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:59.060]   money now but doesn't have as good of a long-term future for you personally.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.580]   All of these things can be adjusted by the individuals involved.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.700]   But in almost every example, what I've always come to the opinion of that the money is more
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:12.180]   helpful for your children when you're still alive, when it's younger than it will be just
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.940]   to inherit it when you're old because by then they probably won't need it.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:23.420]   Now that's not to say that we should just be freely giving our children tons of money
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.540]   from an early age.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.660]   I don't know exactly what the right thing to do is.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:34.420]   I didn't grow up with wealthy parents and so I've always prided myself on not having
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.220]   taken any significant financial support from my parents once I got out of high school.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.980]   And that's always been something that I've looked at it and seen that, you know what,
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.140]   that built character in me.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.940]   I've seen that it was a good thing.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:50.100]   However, as I'm growing older, I'm coming to realize that there are a set of experiences
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.180]   that since I didn't come from the money class that maybe I don't have an accurate understanding
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:59.500]   of how valuable it can be for parents to give their children money.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.940]   I find as I work with my own children, I find myself doing things that, you know, where
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.940]   I say, "Listen, I'm happy to give you money.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.940]   Money is not the problem.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.860]   What I want you to do is I want you to put your effort and attention over here in this
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   other thing."
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.940]   And I've generally in the past had the personal impression that if parents gave too much money
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.380]   to their children that their children would turn out to be lazy or entitled.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.340]   And certainly there are lazy and entitled children.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.580]   But I think that there are other ways to do it.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.840]   There are other ways to adjust it and that it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.500]   And sometimes if a child has character and is not lazy and entitled, getting the money
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.260]   can be a major benefit to them.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.980]   Having access to a family bank that they can use to fund their business projects or to
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.900]   fund some of their personal needs can be really significant.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.060]   And so I'm not sold that wealthy parents just give their children tons and tons of money
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:39:00.060]   because I think that that has too high of a risk of turning children into dependents.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:06.220]   But I do think that there is value in children having access to the family bank, the family
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.880]   financing, etc.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.180]   But even from the perspective of pure consumption, let's say we're not talking about anything
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.660]   that's going to grow, we're not talking about business investments or educational investments,
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:22.180]   but a pure consumption, I think it can be a real joy and a benefit for wealthy parents
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:27.020]   to facilitate really nice consumption items for their children.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.940]   And so you might simply want to invest your money into something that creates a great
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.560]   lifestyle for your children.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.960]   Maybe it's going ahead and buying the beach house that's going to be an anchoring point
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.860]   for family gatherings for a very long time or buying the lake house or the mountain cabin
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.020]   or whatever your version of that is, the ski chalet.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.420]   Having the place that's the family property that people go to can be a great investment
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.780]   in your family culture and building a strong family, giving your grandchildren an anchoring
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.900]   point.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.620]   It's not just consumption, it's investment into the younger generation.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:08.100]   Maybe you go ahead and outfit that house with the toys that make it really fun, you know,
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.420]   the season lift tickets, the nice boat that anybody can take out and use, and you fund
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.740]   those things and that builds, it's an investment into your family culture.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:24.700]   I think that having the joy of that is something that more parents, more wealthy people in
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.940]   the middle and second half of their life should consider.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.220]   I've frequently given that advice to parents and to grandparents.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.740]   I've said, "Listen, you should start spending more money and you should invest the money
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.740]   into your children.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.380]   Why are you trying to stack up this giant inheritance that you're going to randomly
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.340]   leave to these college funds?
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:46.460]   Wouldn't you rather fund a really great annual vacation with your children?
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.540]   Wouldn't you rather take all your grandchildren to Europe and spend a month traveling all
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.460]   around Europe in style?
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.580]   Wouldn't you rather have, again, that big lake house that everyone's going to come to
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.500]   on the 4th of July and everyone's going to come to for Thanksgiving and everyone's going
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.860]   to come to it at Christmas?
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:07.020]   And wouldn't you rather fund those big things and build a family culture of togetherness?
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:12.740]   Wouldn't you rather make sure that you invest in the property that's suitable, that you
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:17.500]   hire the caterers so that we can have these big giant parties and that you pay to help
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.700]   everybody get there every year if necessary?
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.060]   Wouldn't you rather enjoy spending your money when you can be there rather than knowing
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.060]   that when they're all at your funeral they're saying, "Yeah, I got some more money from
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   mom and dad."
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:37.420]   Now, the size of your wealth will vary and will make your use of the money, it has to
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.980]   make sense at your scale.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.100]   And so there's a big difference between having $8 billion and $8 million.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.580]   There's a big difference between having $8 million and $800,000.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.340]   But if you get clear on what you're trying to accomplish, then it can make a difference.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.940]   So that's the first thing is family.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:59.980]   And I think that Feeney is right with regard to spend the money while you're alive, at
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   least if you can.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.780]   Unless you have too much money where you can't spend any more money profitably on your family,
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.780]   spend the money while you're alive.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.840]   Because spending the money in some of these ways I think has more impact than leaving
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.020]   it behind when you're dead.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.100]   Now we could also talk about friends and helping friends out, but I think the same lesson applies
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.100]   there.
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:25.460]   I just want to point it out quickly, but not labor on it.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:31.060]   Some people say, "I want to leave money to my niece, my nephew, my uncle, my best friend,
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.620]   you know, the guy who's cut my grass for 20 years, etc."
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.620]   That's great.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.180]   And if you have some money and you just want to leave that behind as a nice thing, fine.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.740]   You know, I had a friend of mine, a friend and neighbor who they were very, they didn't
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:49.340]   have much money, lived on social security and they for years were a caretaker, an in-home
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.460]   caretaker for someone who was wealthy.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.620]   And when she died, she left them several tens of thousands of dollars in her will and it
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.780]   was a great blessing for them.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.420]   They paid off their house, they bought a riding lawnmower, etc.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.040]   And so those things can be really, really nice and really good.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.540]   But I still continue to believe that in many circumstances it's better for you to give
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.300]   the money while you're alive so that you can see it.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.020]   And so whether that means that you want to affect it, for example, maybe you notice that
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.780]   somebody's in debt and you say, "I'm going to come and I'm going to pay off your debt
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.260]   for you, but here are the terms of my agreement."
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.940]   You can do that when you're alive in a way that you can't necessarily do that when you're
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.000]   dead.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.820]   Even if you're giving the money anonymously, you can have the joy of giving the money anonymously
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:39.340]   and seeing that the money, seeing the joy that comes with it even through an anonymous
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.380]   gift.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.000]   You can rejoice with your friends that, "Wow, somebody died and left me this money or somebody
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.880]   gave me this money anonymously," and you can be excited for them without them ever knowing
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.300]   that it came from you.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.820]   Or you can give the money to them or you can use it to build, take them on nice trips,
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.900]   do nice things with them, invite people into your circle and fund it so that you can enjoy
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.300]   the pleasure of their company.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:07.980]   Spending money on people and even just to make friends is one of the most fun and best
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.180]   ways to spend money.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:17.180]   And it can help to alleviate even just your loneliness that may come at an older age.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.420]   There have been plenty of times where you see somebody who is older and they got lots
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.860]   of money but they're lonely and I've often said, "Why don't you take some of the money
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.620]   and why don't you spend it on friendships?"
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:36.860]   And I'm not saying buy the person off, but spend the money on letting them be able to
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.300]   join you for things that they otherwise wouldn't be able to join you on.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.420]   When I was in high school and college I had a friend of mine who was an older man who
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:51.700]   was single and he did well financially and one of the things that was just a great blessing
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:57.480]   to me was that I enjoyed spending time with him and he financed it.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.180]   We would go out to dinner and he would pay for the food.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:06.700]   We did different things together.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.260]   Sometimes some of my brothers would go, my brothers were also friends with him, we had
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.820]   other friends in common and he would fund things that I wasn't able to fund.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.120]   And he had things, he would let me use his truck, he would let me borrow one of his motorcycles,
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:27.220]   he would let me use some of his stuff and did it in a way that allowed me to have some
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:33.060]   really fun experiences and to do some really cool things and he got the pleasure of my
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.060]   company.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   Now of course in our current very sensitive world, things like that you need to be cautious
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:46.140]   and careful because there are people who do things and use their money in a way that doesn't
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:52.380]   result in, where they don't have clear and pure intentions.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:58.860]   And I'm even intensely conscious even as I describe what I just said how it can sound
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.100]   a little bit strange.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:06.700]   But in this case it was genuinely just a genuine relationship of friendship and I still consider
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.140]   him to be a very good friend and it's just been a blessing.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:17.360]   And so he as a single man, no children, etc. was able to use his money and spend it on
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:22.380]   his friends in a way that helped him to have more companionship and friendship and to have
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.700]   more fun than he would have had otherwise.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.460]   And so spending your money on your friends is a very reasonable thing for you to do and
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.540]   very well worth considering.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.460]   And we now turn to the third big thing that people want to leave their money to which
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:42.700]   is charities, some sort of charitable endeavor.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.460]   I think a lot of money, personally, my personal opinion, I think a lot of money that is spent
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.940]   on charities is not spent very well.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:55.740]   And it's usually not spent very well because of the difficulty of doing charity well.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:00.940]   And so people often revert to the easy solution, the thing that is easy for them that doesn't
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.580]   cost them time and effort to be involved.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:08.260]   They say, "You know what, I had a good experience at my college and so I'll leave my college
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.660]   some money for their endowment."
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.700]   They say, "You know what, I like animals and so I'll leave some money to this big animal
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:16.700]   charity."
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:22.980]   Or, "I had breast cancer and so I'll leave some money to the Breast Cancer Foundation."
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.500]   And charities need money.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.420]   They survive on money.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:31.700]   But I think what I've observed is, and the reason I say it's not spent well, is that
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:36.740]   a lot of times the money that is left to charities in this way is, number one, left without strings
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.740]   attached.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.380]   It's just a gift given to the charity, which I think is a poor way to give money.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.580]   I think that you should expect a return from your money and you should place conditions
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.580]   onto it.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.420]   Now, those conditions should be things that you think are appropriate.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.420]   And it's not to say that you're going to be guaranteed a return on your money, but when
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.780]   you're giving money, it should come with conditions.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.700]   It should come with an expectation of proper usage.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:08.260]   So in the same way that you wouldn't give your 16-year-old son, who's addicted to drugs,
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.060]   you wouldn't give him $100,000 cash and say, "Here, do whatever you want."
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.260]   You would say, "I'm going to give you things but they're going to come with strings attached.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.340]   You need to do the same thing with charities.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:22.580]   Second reason I think it's often poorly done is people give their money into things that
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.460]   they can't make a big impact.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:31.540]   So the classic, maybe giving it to a big breast cancer research and you say, "Okay, well,
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:36.240]   I had breast cancer so I'm going to give a $10,000 contribution to this multi-billion
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.220]   dollar breast cancer research foundation."
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.340]   Listen, it's your money.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.500]   You can do what you want.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.500]   I don't understand why you would do that.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:50.620]   A $10,000 donation to a multi, you know, hundred million, multi-billion dollar in some cases
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:56.980]   foundation, that, you know, that puts you on level 37 of their donor list.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:02.220]   It's not level 82, which is the $10 a month guys, but it's level 37.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:09.060]   Why not take the $10,000 and give it to something where that $10,000 makes a big difference?
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:14.740]   Why not find, you know, do the work and find an independent researcher where the $10,000
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.140]   helps them or the single mom with breast cancer where the $10,000 helps her pay off $10,000
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.740]   of credit card debt?
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:27.860]   In the same way that I think that we should invest our money at an appropriate scale where
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.540]   we're going to get a good return based upon the amount of money we have, I think that
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.420]   we should invest our money in charity at an appropriate scale.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:40.580]   So if you've got $8 billion to give away, then a giant breast cancer foundation or a
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.880]   giant institution makes a big difference.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.240]   But just imagine, right?
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:52.460]   Think about what, you know, what Feeney gave away to Cornell, right?
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:50:00.220]   He gave Cornell University $965 million, but you're a Cornell grad and you're going to
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:04.500]   go, you know, all around and get all excited about leaving Cornell University a million
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.740]   dollars.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.180]   What's the point?
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:11.660]   Where you could leave that million dollars to some itty bitty university and you can
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:16.900]   establish something that's going to be life changing in terms of your impact.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:21.020]   Your million dollars left at Cornell University is completely immaterial.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.220]   Now their director of planned giving will of course say that it is and what do you want
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.220]   named after you?
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.180]   We can name this scholarship and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.140]   But why not find somebody where your million dollars makes you a big fish?
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:35.380]   And the reason you do that is because it allows you to exercise your vision of what should
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.100]   happen.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.120]   Whatever you think should happen is up to you.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.700]   But you find someone that fits your personal ideology and then you do that.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.180]   Don't be lazy with your charitable giving.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.980]   But in addition, I think that you should give it while you're alive.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.140]   And in a minute we're going to pivot into some of the cursory overview of the financial
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.940]   planning implications.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:01.540]   But if you give it while you're alive, you can give it, you can see the work being done
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.980]   and you can pull it back if you need to.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.940]   So whatever the scale of your wealth is, if giving $100 is the scale of wealth that you
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:15.460]   are, where you are, then give the $100 to a place where the $100 is going to make a
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.620]   big difference.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:23.740]   If you're at the scale of $1,000 or $100,000 or a million or 10 million, figure out where
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.020]   can this money move the needle.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:31.580]   And then figure out who at this scale is doing a really good job so that I can make a big
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.980]   difference and I can put the money there and I can double the results.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.740]   It can amplify the impacts.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.900]   With charities, is it fine to give money away to charities when you're dead?
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.580]   Of course it is.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:49.860]   But I think your better bet is to plan to give the money away while you're alive so
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:54.340]   that you can see it and make sure that it is properly handled, that you can see it and
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:59.380]   you can make sure that they don't all of a sudden change their mandate.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:04.540]   And you've got to pick when is the right time in your life to do it, but I think it's best
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.380]   to do it while they're alive, while you're alive.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.660]   And of course, without question, while they're alive.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.180]   Don't leave your money to a dead charity.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.780]   Let's talk about financial planning now.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.780]   Why don't people give away more money when they're alive?
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.780]   Well, they don't, usually they don't give it away because they're not sure if they're
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.420]   going to need it.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.380]   They don't know if I'm going to need this money for me.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.300]   I might have unexpected medical expenses.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.060]   Inflation might take off like a rocket.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.620]   I might not be able to, you know, I might want to spend more money in the future than
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   I'm spending now.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.320]   This looks very different when you're 30 versus when you're 70.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.580]   When you're 30, your lifestyle expenses are very much not determined.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.580]   They're not planned.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.580]   They're not clear.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.020]   When you're 70, most people by the time they're 70 will have chosen a lifestyle that they
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.340]   feel is appropriate for them.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:53:00.100]   Most 70 year olds have a fairly decent expectation of what they expect their long-term expenses
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.140]   to be.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.660]   The big unknown is generally medical expenses because people don't know what kind of medical
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.500]   expenses they might have.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:14.900]   They leave generally a fairly large amount of question mark related to medical expenses.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.020]   But I've not personally interacted with any 70 year olds who said, "Well, I'm currently
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.620]   spending $300,000 a year to maintain our lifestyle.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.860]   But you know, in the future I might spend $600,000 a year."
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.320]   Just doesn't really happen.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:32.700]   So once you reach the second half of your life, you're probably going to have pretty
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:38.120]   well laid out your personal lifestyle, your personal living expenses.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.300]   Now let's pretend, let's say it's an interesting financial experiment.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:48.580]   Let's pretend that you wanted to make sure that you bounced your last check.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.260]   Literally you wanted to make sure that you bounced your last check.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.260]   How could you do that?
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.260]   How would you do that?
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.260]   Well, with regard to your investments, you would have to figure out how to turn your
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:06.220]   investments into an income stream where they had a terminal value of zero.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:11.420]   There is one very clear winner here and that is an annuity contract.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.300]   That is what an annuity contract is.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.060]   That's what it does.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.240]   An annuity contract is the opposite of life insurance.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:25.140]   Life insurance is a scheme by where you pay premium payments, monthly annual premium payments
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.620]   to the policy, and when you die, it creates a pot of money.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:34.380]   On the other hand, an annuity contract is a way of taking a pot of money and then paying
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.380]   you out payments for the rest of your life.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:43.100]   The most obvious annuity contract that virtually all of us have is some form of pension or
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.380]   some form of retirement payments that come in from your government.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.100]   In the United States, this would be the social security system.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.540]   In other countries, the name varies, but some kind of retirement pension.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:59.380]   The beauty of a retirement pension in that form is you receive an income and when you
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.140]   die, the income stops.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.100]   Now you can do this also in the private market.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.420]   Some people have what's called a defined benefit pension.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.580]   I worked for such and such big company and when I retire or I worked for as a teacher
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:16.860]   or I worked for the fire department or the police department and when I retire, I get
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:21.460]   50% of my retirement salary coming in for the rest of my life.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.180]   I know I have $6,000 a month coming in every single month for the rest of my life or I
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.820]   have $20,000 a month coming in every month for the rest of my life.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.080]   You can do this same thing with a pot of money.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.660]   You can always buy yourself a personal annuity payment.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:37.700]   You can say I've got $2 million here sitting in my 401k.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.340]   What I'll do is I'll take that 401k, I'll roll it over to an IRA and I'll take it to
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:46.060]   an insurance company and I'll buy an annuity with the $2 million in my IRA and I'll get
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:50.580]   a series of monthly payments guaranteed to come in for the rest of my life.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:55.420]   Maybe I get $8,000 a month every month for the rest of my life and then I elect to have
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:56:00.780]   a two-thirds survivor benefit so that when I die, my wife gets two-thirds of that for
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.340]   the rest of her life if she outlives me.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:08.100]   Then when we both die, then the money is totally gone.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.860]   I think this is a very reasonable way to do it.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:17.340]   If I wanted to make sure that I had an income stream that was going to last for my entire
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.460]   lifetime, I would do it with an annuity.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.340]   When you do retirement planning, annuities are really powerful because they allow people
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.860]   to budget based upon income which is how we're accustomed to budgeting.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.860]   They allow you to say, "You know what?
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:35.860]   I have X amount of dollars of income and so I'm going to take this income and I'm going
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:39.580]   to spend it and I can spend all of it."
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.820]   This is one of the most incredible things about wealth planning.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.460]   People who focus on, I think of it like the American style of net worth versus the English
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:47.460]   style.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:53.220]   If you read an old Jane Austen novel, you always hear wealth referred to in the form
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.220]   of income.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.740]   So Mr. Bingley has 19,000 pounds a year, right?
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:58.860]   That's his income.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:06.100]   Or if you're reading an old Jules Verne novel, Monsieur Fogg has whatever he had.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.820]   He's got income because income is what you spend.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.180]   In the American context, we usually talk about net worth.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:19.580]   So instead of saying, "Oh, so and so is worth $300,000 a year," we say, "So and so has $3
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.020]   million."
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:25.220]   The problem with net worth is that it's hard to turn it into income and income is what
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.220]   we spend.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.300]   Now of course, if you have a $3 million net worth, you could choose to spend $3 million
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:35.360]   in a certain month, but it's easier if you know my budget is $20,000 a month.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.980]   If you knew that you had $20,000 a month coming in every month for the rest of your life or
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.380]   if you knew that you had $100,000 a month coming in every month for the rest of your
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.660]   life, then you're good to go, right?
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.420]   You know this is my budget.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.260]   Usually you can budget from month to month.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.100]   Maybe you have $20,000 coming in a month and you want to take your children on a $30,000
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.100]   cruise.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.540]   So one month you constrict your spending, you pile that up for a couple of months, then
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.880]   you quickly spend it.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:01.280]   But having a guaranteed income allows you to spend freely.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.780]   You're not constrained by, "Am I overspending or am I underspending?"
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:08.740]   Spending money off a portfolio can be very stressful for people.
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.880]   So what often happens is they underspend what they could spend.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.920]   If you've got a portfolio with $5 million into it, you can go to your financial planner
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.940]   and they say, "Well, we calculate that you can actually spend your X number of years
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:26.740]   old so we calculate that you can spend 4.2% so therefore you can spend $210,000 a year."
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:32.140]   The problem is that if all that money is invested into say mutual funds, they can't guarantee
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.140]   that.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.940]   It's impossible to guarantee that level of spending and so you're left with something
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.940]   else.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:38.940]   Well, what are the obvious solutions?
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.780]   Number one is you can buy income-producing investments.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.780]   Maybe that's dividend stocks so then now you're spending your dividends.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:48.340]   But now you're underspending what you could spend because you could spend dividends and
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:53.300]   you could also spend principal very safely but then you're back in the same situation.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:57.460]   So annuities solve this problem beautifully because they're designed to liquidate that
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.460]   sum of money.
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:03.940]   So if you literally wanted to bounce your last check, what would you do?
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.300]   You would take whatever sum of money you're going to live on.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:12.300]   You would buy an annuity or a series of annuities depending on your strategy.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.300]   What I would do is I would make some of those annuities subject to inflation growth.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.620]   So I would make some of them variable annuities with stocks inside the annuities so they would
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.860]   keep up with inflation.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.880]   I might have some of them fixed annuities for a guaranteed portion that wasn't subject
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.940]   to any ups and downs.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.900]   And then what you would do is you would dispose of your other property and you would simply
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.020]   spend your income.
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:36.680]   And so to the extreme perspective, you could rent a house.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.180]   You could rent a very nice house or a modest house but you could rent a house.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.320]   You could lease a car.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:48.180]   You could literally eliminate all your physical property and then you just simply have income
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.180]   payments.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.500]   You spend your money every single month.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.660]   Maybe you save a little from month to month to handle any other thing.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:58.140]   You would probably keep aside a lump sum of money, a hundred grand or whatever is appropriate,
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.820]   a couple hundred grand to serve as a reserve account.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.860]   But you would just spend all your money.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:11.420]   I think that this kind of planning is really neat and by that I mean tidy.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.180]   I very much like the idea.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.980]   At certain phases of my life, I want to own a big house.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.580]   But when I reach a later phase of my life, I don't want to own a big house.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.920]   I want my children to own a big house and I'd be happy to visit them but I want to live
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.340]   in a modest apartment or a modest house.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:32.460]   Or probably ideally, I want to live in a modest apartment at my children's house or in a modest
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:37.060]   place out back, something like that where I don't have to deal with the hassle of maintenance
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.060]   and upkeep.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:42.660]   I just want to have a modest place that gives me a couple of rooms to be in and I want to
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.980]   be surrounded by people I love.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:49.960]   And so the ideal solution for me, at least imagining myself as a grandfather, the ideal
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:56.100]   solution is I want to live with one of my children or maybe have a little place with
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:01.940]   all my children or something like that where I can be close to my children and my grandchildren
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.580]   but not have the hassle of a big house, etc.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.180]   But you could do this just with a rented apartment and I think that it's very tidy to arrange
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.420]   things in this way.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.140]   And now, can you do it also with your own house?
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.140]   Of course you can.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.780]   And so I'm just playing the mental game of what if we wanted to die with zero dollars
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.540]   of net worth so that I could give it all away.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.240]   The problem with having your own house that you live in is while in theory you could establish
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.640]   a reverse mortgage, that's I think generally inadvisable to somebody who isn't desperate
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.900]   for the money.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:37.180]   So if you have your house, you're going to have an asset here that has a value that is
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.140]   eventually going to be passed on.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.180]   Nothing wrong with doing that.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.820]   You can just simply, it's very efficient, right?
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.460]   I lived in the house for a long time.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.620]   I'm going to have this house set aside for my children.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.620]   They're going to inherit it.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.420]   They're going to sell it and they're going to split the money.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   Fine.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.420]   Totally reasonable.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.140]   But I think it's simpler if you even disposed of your real estate just for the purposes
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.580]   of our mental experiment.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:01.820]   What if you did want to leave some money to your children as an inheritance when you die?
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.260]   Or if you wanted to just have some money available?
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.980]   Well, life insurance is I think the obvious solution here.
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:13.140]   If you say, "I need to take care of my final expenses and so I'm going to set aside and
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.020]   have a $100,000 life insurance policy.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:20.820]   That policy has going to have proceeds that are designed to bury me.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:25.140]   That policy is going to have proceeds that are designed to care for any final estate
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.300]   administration expenses, pay off that last check that bounced, etc."
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.580]   Then you can just have that.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.900]   If you wanted to, let's say that somebody hired me and they've got $10 million and they
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   say, "I want all my children to inherit $1 million each.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.140]   But I don't want to give it to them now.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.380]   I want to give it to them when I'm dead.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:51.140]   But I also want to have an income that's modest and I want to make sure that I give the rest
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.340]   of my money away while I'm alive."
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.340]   You can do that with life insurance as well.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:00.100]   So pretend that person bought three $1 million life insurance policies or one $3 million
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:04.740]   life insurance policy and they designate their children as the beneficiaries on those policies.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.420]   Then now on the date of their death, then within a few weeks or a few months, their
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.740]   children will each receive a million dollars cash.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.540]   It's a very efficient way to transfer money.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.540]   It's very, very clean.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.420]   And the nice thing about a life insurance policy is as a way of establishing inheritance
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.820]   is a few things.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:26.740]   Number one, a life insurance policy is clean and it can be done without any worrying about
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.220]   people contesting the will.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:32.580]   So for example, maybe you have three children and you want to disinherit one child, but
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.220]   you want to inherit two children.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.900]   If you have $3 million of property that you leave behind in a will, then your disinherited
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.780]   child can attempt to contest the will, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.700]   A good planner can of course build something that's virtually incontestable, but at the
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.540]   end of the day, if you have a will, the child can contest the will.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.900]   But if you have a life insurance policy and you simply establish that your two children
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.460]   are the beneficiaries and that your third child is not, there's nothing to contest.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:12.180]   The disinherited child has no legal recourse to be able to contest that life insurance
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.180]   payout.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.780]   It's a contract between you and the insurance company.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.280]   It's not a will that they can contest.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.060]   Other nice things about life insurance as a form of estate transfer to beneficiaries
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.700]   is that life insurance is intensely flexible.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.260]   And so you can change at any point in time the beneficiaries of the policy.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.060]   You can establish a trust or not establish a trust.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:35.140]   You can have all that stuff and you can do it very, very easily at any point as long
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.400]   as you are of course competent to make changes to your policy.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.580]   Another nice thing about life insurance, of course here we're obviously talking about
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.380]   some form of whole life insurance policy.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.980]   Term insurance doesn't work for this.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.100]   But with a whole life insurance policy, you have cash reserves.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:54.540]   And so if you're trying to say, "I want the money to be there for an inheritance, but
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.060]   I need to have a little bit of wiggle room.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.860]   I need to have some money that's available for me."
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.980]   Well, you can always borrow against the policy.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.520]   So if somebody has unexpectedly high medical costs and those medical costs aren't covered
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.940]   by other sources of income, then of course you can borrow against the life insurance
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.660]   cash values and then the insurance company will pay off that loan upon your death.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.500]   And so that's a really nice solution as well.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.540]   The other thing that you can do in this situation is you can insure for medical costs with proper
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.700]   insurance.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   And so that would be of course a health insurance policy that's appropriate for you and then
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.220]   possibly a long-term care insurance policy.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:32.500]   And so a long-term care insurance policy should be able to be designed that it would cover
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:38.340]   any significant increase in expenses due to long-term care, thus eliminating that financial
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.580]   burden from your investment portfolio and also from your children.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.140]   So that's the simplest and cleanest way.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:50.900]   And in that scenario, if somebody used those financial tools to do it, in that scenario,
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:06:00.980]   you would be spending on your credit card up to your budget amount that you're living
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:05.460]   on, your $20,000 a month or $10,000 a month coming in from your annuity.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.460]   Every month you would just simply pay off your credit card bill, you would pay your
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.460]   rent, etc.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:14.640]   Then when you died, you would have no estate because you've already disposed of all your
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:20.980]   property and you would literally balance your last check because you would spend your credit
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:26.140]   card and go out for a $500 dinner the night before your death, you die.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:30.580]   Immediately your insurance, your annuity funds stop as of the date of your death and so you
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.140]   don't have any more payments but your checking account is empty and then the credit card
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:36.300]   bill comes due a month later and there's no money to pay it.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.940]   And then the life insurance policies would pay out the death benefits to your children
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.860]   and you would literally balance your last check.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:47.160]   You have no estate, the credit card company would eat the cost of your $500 payment assuming
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.880]   you had no money in your checking account in that scenario.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.860]   Now that's just a fun game to think through about how would I do that.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:00.780]   But you can step back from that now and look at perhaps more serious proposals to say what
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.820]   do I do with my other assets.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.620]   So maybe I have $8 million in stocks.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:10.620]   Well if I bought with $2 million, I bought enough income for me to live on, then I can
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.700]   go ahead and give away those $6 million.
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:17.180]   I can give them away whenever I want to and I can give them all away because I know I've
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.340]   guaranteed my income.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.620]   I'm sure of my income and so I can give away all my other money.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.800]   Similar things with property.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.080]   You could do this of course with real estate.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.980]   Maybe you're living on a rental income portfolio and then you'd simply designate that at your
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.940]   death those real estate properties get donated to a charity or given to your children or
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.940]   anything.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:40.540]   If you have other assets, then there's no reason to go out taking life insurance policies
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.860]   out if you have another asset that you would want to be passed along.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:49.260]   And there may be significant financial benefits to choosing other assets.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.100]   We don't want to forget about tax planning for example.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:57.580]   If you had maybe you had three rental properties and you have three children and you identify
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:03.300]   that one of these rental properties is going to go to each child, you may have could potentially
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.980]   have millions of dollars of gain in those properties and now those properties would
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.260]   receive a step up in tax basis at the date of your death and then be passed along to
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.700]   your children.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.820]   You might have highly appreciated stocks and the same thing would happen or other long-term
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:22.860]   capital gains property and so it would be very advantageous for you to use that as part
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:28.140]   of the assets that you passed along to your children rather than to keep them for yourself.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.980]   So there are many ways that this could be done but if you start with the idea that this
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:36.740]   is what you want to do, it'll clarify some of your planning and give your professional
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:41.740]   advisors something to work with as far as you have a clear intent.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.820]   So you can play with the details for yourself.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.740]   I want to close by talking about assets that I would not do this with.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:54.100]   I don't personally have the ambition to balance my last check.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:58.340]   Now I'm so young that it's impossible for me to know where I'll be at 70.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.580]   There could be a very wide range of opportunities.
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:08.380]   But I don't think that for I think for many people I don't think Mr. Feeney's plan is
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.820]   actually the ideal plan.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:16.020]   And let me talk about some of the assets that I don't that I think should not be used in
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.420]   the way that he did it.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:23.900]   I think the most obvious asset would be if you have some form of business that your family
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.300]   is involved in.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:31.540]   I think that one of the best assets to build and develop is a business or a series of businesses
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:36.660]   that become a part an integrated part of your family culture.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.860]   It could be a duty-free shop, sure.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:41.020]   I don't know why he chose to do that.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.080]   I don't know if his children were not involved in it.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.220]   But if I had built a string of multi-billion dollar duty-free shops, number one, I can't
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.420]   see why I would want to go public.
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.340]   And number two, I wouldn't sell.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.620]   I would keep the business.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:01.420]   And with the income from the business, I would go ahead and use that income to fund charitable
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.860]   endeavors if I felt that that was appropriate.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.420]   But I wouldn't sell any of the business to myself, at least what I can guess.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.260]   Now again, I haven't been there.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.720]   Maybe it would be different if I were on the other side of the table and I actually had
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.300]   done what he did.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.900]   But I can't imagine that I would do that.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:20.980]   I would keep the business and I would keep it as part of my family's identity, my family
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:21.980]   business.
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:22.980]   This would be the family business.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.020]   And I would use that family business as an anchoring point for the family.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.880]   Number one is it would provide the family with a steady stream of income.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.100]   That income can be spent.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.660]   There's the income for educations.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.460]   There's the income to help people get established.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.340]   Importantly also, it would be part of the family identity.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   It would be part of where they would be employed.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.500]   I would employ my children.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.820]   I would employ my extended family.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.380]   I would bring people into the business and we would use it as a training ground.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.420]   And we'd use it as a training ground to grow it even bigger.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:54.820]   And I would train my family and I would set out a family vision of here's what this business
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:58.240]   is going to be and here's what this business stands for.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.980]   And then pass that business along to hopefully faithful children who would then pass it along
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.380]   through the years.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:09.620]   But I would much rather have a family business that can support the branching out family
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:14.580]   tree that would come under our family rather than just pass money along.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:19.380]   I think that money is often, while I stand by what I said earlier that it can be very
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:23.580]   useful, I think that money is often the most hollow thing for children to inherit because
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.540]   money doesn't come with any soul.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.540]   It's just money.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:27.700]   It's just spendable money.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.160]   It doesn't come with family identity.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.540]   It doesn't come with those things.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:41.060]   And so I think that a business, I would not break up a business just to give it all away
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.060]   while I was alive.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.060]   I would keep the business.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.500]   I would be happy to give away income.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.180]   But I would keep the business and have that identified as the family business and have
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.940]   it be a training ground.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.480]   Because I think that it can do far more good that way and I think it would be very hard
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.780]   to find a better investment than the family business.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.400]   If you got a highly profitable family business, why would you go and take all the money out
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.100]   of that and then go and invest it into a bunch of other people's businesses?
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.900]   Well, you do a little bit for diversification, but for the bulk of your wealth, is that really
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.940]   what you're going to do?
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:09.940]   I say no.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:15.420]   I say keep the family business and then train people to run it well.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:23.460]   Now, of course, a family business can also be combined with a family foundation and that
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.380]   can create more opportunities for the family to be employed within the business, within
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.500]   the foundation, to help to work things.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.100]   That's the ideal structure.
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.340]   But I personally can't imagine that I would liquidate all of my shares in a highly profitable
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:37.860]   business just to give the money away.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.060]   Not everybody has a family business, so what other assets would I not liquidate?
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:45.340]   I would be very slow to liquidate a family property, especially if there were a family
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.860]   property that had some form of identity.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:51.500]   Now this, meaning that this had been important to the family for a period of time.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.540]   This is notoriously difficult, especially if you're trying to leave an equal inheritance.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.820]   So pretend that you have a nice lake house and you've got four children or three children
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:05.140]   or whatever, and some of your children like the lake house and some of them don't.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.360]   Well, that's really tough.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.740]   It's tough for a planner because they've got to figure out, well, do we sell the lake house?
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.380]   And maybe two of your children say, "No, we don't want to sell it."
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.820]   And two of your children say, "Yes, we want to sell it.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.220]   We want the money."
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:20.580]   So what I would do is I would try to set up and establish that this property is going
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:25.500]   to stay a family property for a period of time, and I would set up the financial infrastructure
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.260]   to fund for the expenses of that property.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:30.900]   We might set up, put the property in a trust and put enough income in it, put enough money
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:34.860]   in the trust that it could handle the property's expenses for a period of time so it could
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.680]   remain the family's property.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.180]   That gets difficult with who's going to use it when, et cetera, but I would want there
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:44.660]   to be, if there's a family property, maybe we have a family farm or we have this, those
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:50.180]   things I think can serve as a really neat anchoring point of the family.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.420]   And so if you have a property like that, then I say, think it through carefully, but I would
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.540]   be cautious about disposing of it too quickly.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.740]   I didn't used to think that way.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.140]   Ten years ago, I didn't think that way.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:04.820]   But today, getting older, seeing my children get older, I think I'm convinced that I was
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.020]   wrong before, and I see the value in that.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:14.940]   My wife and I are talking about what is it that we can do that will be part of our family
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940]   property.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.740]   And I'm thinking about things that will be long-term, things that don't make a lot of
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.860]   money but that have a form of identity.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.940]   So I'm considering, well, do we buy a ranch?
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.020]   Do we buy an olive grove, an olive farm?
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:33.300]   What is it that we can do that will be, this would be our family place that gives a sense
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.300]   of identity?
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.020]   And it's basically a place that your children can retreat to.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:42.220]   It might be the place of summer vacations, but then what if one of your children has
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.260]   a setback or gets fired or something like that?
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.200]   Do you have a family property that they can retreat to?
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:53.500]   They can go back to, they can get their feet under themselves and can reestablish?
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.060]   I've become acutely aware of this, even just for myself over the last number of years,
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:03.780]   is that my family in Florida, we had a big property that was where we grew up.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.460]   My dad had built this big house, but then he sold it and he moved into a condo and none
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.220]   of us wanted to keep the big house.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.380]   At the time, that seemed like the right move.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.500]   And my dad was glad not to have to deal with the upkeep, etc.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   But what I've realized now is it's very hard for me because I don't have an easy place
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:24.060]   that as a family I can go back to in Florida.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.420]   We no longer have the family place.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:31.180]   And since I dissolved all of my property there, it leaves me with these family connections,
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.840]   but without any physical connections to the place.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.840]   And so that's hard.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.620]   It feels a little bit strange for me to say, "Well, I'm going to go see my family, but
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.380]   I'm going to stay in a hotel."
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.540]   That's never how I imagined this phase of my life being.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.000]   And so I've come to appreciate some of those things as well.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.060]   There are other assets as well that obviously shouldn't be sold.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:55.140]   There may be family assets and maybe physical assets, things that are unique to your family.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:16:01.720]   But I think I've made my points.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.920]   When you are thinking about your estate, recognize that you're going to have the responsibility
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:13.100]   to dispose of your stuff in a way that's going to be helpful.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:20.460]   And I think that one ambition that you can have in your mind is to have a tidy estate,
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.740]   to not leave a bunch of stuff.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:27.300]   One of my grandparents died and he left a bunch of property and he left a farm, but
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.660]   his farm had a 20-acre junkyard on it.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:33.900]   And it was a blessing, of course, to the family to inherit this thing.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.060]   And of course, when farmers die, you inherit property.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.420]   That's how the farming business works.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:45.380]   But it is a 20-acre junkyard and it took years and years and years to clean it up and scrap
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.380]   this and whatnot.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.140]   It was a huge project.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.900]   And I don't see how he could have done anything different.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.220]   I don't think it would have been possible for him to do it.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.620]   But I think that one of my ambitions is just I don't want to leave junk behind.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:03.300]   So if I assume that I die as an old man and I don't die young, then I don't want to leave
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.460]   a bunch of junk behind.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.680]   I want to have things taken care of.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.200]   And so having this basic goal to give away all the money while I'm alive, to me, it rings
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.680]   true in my heart with the caveat stated.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.920]   Even with things like the business, that should be given away with, again, technical details
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.920]   behind the scenes with what it actually means to give it away.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.200]   In theory, if I reach an old age and we have a family business, I don't want to be operating
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.940]   the family business anymore.
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.060]   Maybe I'll still technically own shares.
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.960]   Maybe the shares have been moved into a trust.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.960]   Who knows?
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.320]   It depends on where you wind up in your personal planning.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.280]   But I don't want to be actively operating it anymore.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.920]   I want to have gone ahead and passed it on to the younger generation so that they can
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.780]   have full ownership and not wait until they're 63 years old to inherit the family business.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:51.780]   That's wrong.
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:56.620]   You shouldn't be a 90-year-old guy still running the family business and then making your 63-year-old
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:00.440]   son who's going to take over as CEO wait until you die to take over.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.040]   It should be done earlier than that.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.200]   There should be a healthy form of succession put in place.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.520]   So I love this conceptually.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.880]   I love the idea of giving the money away, giving it to my children when they're young
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.160]   enough for it to do them some good, giving it to the grandchildren when they're young
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.740]   enough to do them some good, giving it either in the form of physical cash, investing into
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:23.840]   paying bills, passing on assets, giving it to them in experiences that they wouldn't
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.420]   otherwise be able to achieve due to their age.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:31.480]   But I don't want to die with a bunch of money unspent.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.280]   I don't want, you know, say my little thing, don't send me flowers at my funeral.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.400]   Send me flowers before.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.400]   I can't smell them.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   I can't see them.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.880]   I can't enjoy them when I'm dead.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.280]   Send them to me now.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:49.040]   Let's not wait until, let's not save millions of dollars and then leave it to our children
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.800]   and then the children go on a ski vacation in my honor.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.440]   Let's take the children on a ski vacation and do it when I can still ski.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.400]   So I hope these ideas are useful to you and may you know wisdom as you put together your
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.240]   own circumstances.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.520]   As I close today's show, I want to remind you of a course that I sell at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:11.160]   called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.320]   What I'll tell you is that some of the ideas that I discuss in that course can form a fundamental
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.240]   foundation and for me they do of what I'm describing here.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.280]   So let's say that you lay out a goal and you say, I'd like to have an asset that is going
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.680]   to be passed on through the years.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:33.440]   Maybe we live in, I don't know, Massachusetts, but I'd like to have an olive farm or I'd
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.120]   like to have a ranch.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.600]   So you can just simply make this a fundamental part of your overall long-term plan.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.880]   Maybe you decide that what we're going to do is I'm going to buy a ranch in Western
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.880]   Canada.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.360]   I'm going to buy a cattle ranch in Western Canada and that's going to be the family property.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:58.760]   And so to make that happen, maybe you, of course you don't have to be a Canadian citizen,
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   but that would help.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.480]   So perhaps you devote a few years of your life to going to that ranch, to setting things
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:07.320]   up, commuting back and forth to Massachusetts, use that time period to become a Canadian
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.340]   citizen and then your children to become Canadian citizens and now you're dual citizens.
[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:15.120]   But what you have now is you have a ranch that can be the family property that we go
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:21.200]   spend summers at the cabin on the lakes in Ontario or the ranch in Western, you know,
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.760]   in BC or wherever you wind up going and you use that as your anchoring place.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.840]   Maybe you run some cattle, you have a local caretaker that lives on the property and cares
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.280]   for the property for you and then you outfit that property with the things that your family
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.080]   needs for fun.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.000]   Maybe you keep horses there so that we can ride horses when we're there and do all of
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.280]   the fun Western ranching things.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.680]   You outfit the property with reserves of, you know, make it energy independent.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.400]   You put reserves of food and supplies and other things that you would need there and
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.920]   then you have a backup location in another country.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.800]   So if something goes wrong for you in Massachusetts or in the United States, you now have your
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:11.700]   cabin in the lakes of Ontario or your ranch in Western BC.
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:18.160]   Maybe you say I want to buy an olive farm and so you shop around and maybe you find
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:24.200]   something in Croatia or in Montenegro or in Greece or Spain.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:29.080]   And so in that course we talk about going ahead and setting up some of these things
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.460]   in advance and then establishing the necessary paperwork.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:37.880]   So you go ahead and become a Spanish citizen so that you can have your olive farm or get
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:42.020]   the Montenegro residency so that you can get access to that and that becomes the place
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:43.600]   that you go for vacation.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.120]   You're right on the Mediterranean, you've got your olive farm, this is the place that
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.440]   you're going to go, but it's also convenient for you.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.880]   If you needed to leave the United States, you now have the ability to do that.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:59.920]   This entire course was birthed out of my observation that the best thing to do, the best way to
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:05.600]   survive and thrive during any kind of crisis is simply by not being where there is a crisis.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.200]   And in that course I talk about two basic approaches.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:13.800]   Number one is being provisioned and prepared, supplied, stockpiled, the things that you
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:18.880]   need so that if there's an economic crisis you have the things that you need prepared.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   But then on the other side to be able to go to some place where there isn't a crisis.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:29.200]   And you can even see right now in a pandemic, about the only thing that can shut the world
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.020]   down completely is a pandemic.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:36.360]   And so what we're seeing right now is a pretty good stress test of what do you do if all
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.840]   of a sudden some guy gets shot in your town and there's riots in your town, do you have
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   a plan for that?
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:47.440]   What do you do if your country is shut down for pandemic restrictions or you decide you
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]   need to go somewhere else?
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.880]   Do you have a safe place that you can go to get away from the mess in situation A?
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.320]   And so I just encourage you, it's a great course.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.200]   If you're interested in having a really solid plan for how to survive and thrive during

[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:21.400]   That spark of an idea created something you have to see to believe.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:27.640]   Grand and exhilarating, an unparalleled entertainment experience.
