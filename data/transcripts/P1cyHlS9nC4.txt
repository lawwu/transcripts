[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Did you guys see this clip, by the way, six minutes of 100 spokespeople and proxies. And
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.880]   they all had the same thing to say about President Biden, which is he is sharp as a tack sharp as a
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.600]   tack, which end of attack the round part. This is a man who is sharp. This is a very sharp president.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.880]   And the people that I've talked to say he's sharp as a tack. He's fine. They say he's
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.840]   sharp. He was sharp. He's sharp as a tack. If I asked 100 people on the street,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.360]   what do you think of Elon Musk, you'd have 100 different statements, there'd be a general theme.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.680]   But you would not have even 50 people repeat the exact same words. And so you have this funny
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.920]   situation where 100 different people were basically saying the exact same talking point.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.800]   So it's not even a point of view. It was just something that they were told to say by somebody
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.240]   else. And that to your point, sacks is the real issue, which is that you don't really
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.640]   have an honest media here. And so there is no check and balance on power right now.
