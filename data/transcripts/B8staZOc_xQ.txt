[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I want to highlight some recent findings in an area totally
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   separate from mental health that I think are really
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.940]   important for everyone to know about.
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.960]   This is a paper published in the journal Cell,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.040]   which is a Cell Press journal, an excellent journal.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.880]   In fact, one of the three apex journals.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.440]   So for those of you that are curious,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.560]   papers published in the journal Nature, Science, and Cell
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.040]   are considered the sort of Superbowl, Stanley Cup,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.180]   and NBA championships of publishing.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.040]   And this paper entitled an Interorgan Neural Circuit
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.360]   for Appetite Suppression,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.140]   illustrates a very important principle
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.800]   that I think everyone should know about.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.200]   And that's the principle of so-called parallel pathways.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   Parallel pathways, as the name suggests,
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680]   are pathways that could be neural pathways
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700]   or hormonal pathways or otherwise,
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.180]   that operate independently of one another
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.800]   to accomplish a common goal.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.520]   And what this paper really shows
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.380]   is that there's a set of peptides in the body.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.460]   And the peptide that I'm referring to today
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.220]   is called a GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide one,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.480]   and some related peptides.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.720]   I've talked about these on the podcast before
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.540]   for two reasons.
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.540]   First of all, I'm a big proponent and consumer of yerba mate.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.400]   Yerba mate is a tea that can promote the release
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.740]   of glucagon-like peptide one.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.400]   And there are also new prescription drugs
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.720]   that are now hitting the market,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.800]   and for which there are really impressive clinical trials
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.720]   for diabetes and obesity,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.960]   that are essentially glucagon-like peptide one stimulator.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.200]   So they stimulate the release of that,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   or they are in fact a synthetic version
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.680]   of glucagon-like peptide one.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.880]   What is glucagon-like peptide one?
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.720]   It is a peptide, which is a small little protein
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.880]   that can dramatically suppress appetite.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.240]   So that's why these drugs are being explored
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.080]   and are showing quite impressive results
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.980]   for things like treatment of type two diabetes
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.280]   and other forms of diabetes, as well as obesity.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.800]   So they lead to weight loss.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.740]   Now, in terms of the yerba mate stimulation
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.040]   of glucagon-like peptide one,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.960]   that's going to be a much lower amount
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.820]   of glucagon-like peptide one that's released
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.400]   from drinking yerba mate,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.880]   as opposed to say, taking a drug that stimulates GLP-1
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.300]   or taking a drug that is GLP-1.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.040]   Nonetheless, I should also point out
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.380]   that yerba mate comes in a bunch of different forms.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.820]   There is some concern about certain smoky flavored forms
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.060]   of yerba mate being carcinogenic.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.580]   So that's why I avoid those forms of yerba mate.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.940]   But for me, yerba mate is one of the preferred sources
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.060]   of caffeine for me.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.260]   I like the way it tastes.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.200]   It does provide that sort of caffeine kick
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.980]   that I like to have early in the day for focus
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.980]   and for work and for exercise.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.700]   And yet I actively avoid the smoked varieties
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.820]   of yerba mate because of the potential carcinogenic effects
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.060]   of the smoked varieties.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.780]   Glucagon-like peptide one, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.520]   can suppress appetite.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.700]   But what this paper shows is it does that
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.460]   by at least two mechanisms through parallel pathways.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.100]   What this paper shows is that glucagon-like peptide one
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.940]   acts on receptors in the body,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.380]   in a portion of the nervous system
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.300]   called the enteric nervous system,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.740]   E-N-T-E-R-I-C, enteric nervous system.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.020]   This is a component of your nervous system
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.600]   that you don't really have control over.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.980]   It's autonomic or automatic.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.020]   GLP-1 binds to what are called
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.600]   intestinal fugal enteric neurons.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.780]   You don't need to know the name,
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.480]   but those neurons do two things.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.980]   First of all, they cause some gut distention.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.140]   So they actually make you feel full.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.260]   This is incredible, right?
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.620]   A peptide, not actual physical food,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.020]   but a peptide that stimulates neurons
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.160]   that cause changes in the so-called mechanoreceptors
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.620]   of the gut of the enteric nervous system
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.340]   and make people feel full.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.320]   So it can lead to actually mild,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   or I suppose, if levels of GLP-1 are very high,
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.140]   to major gut distention, okay?
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.780]   I think that the levels of GLP-1
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.220]   that would come from drinking yerba mate
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.240]   and hopefully from appropriate dosaging
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.340]   of the synthetic forms of GLP-1
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.700]   or drugs that stimulate GLP-1
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.020]   would cause mild, not major gut distention,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.460]   'cause major gut distention would be uncomfortable.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.820]   So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.220]   to increase gut distention and by way of a pathway
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.640]   that goes from the gut up to the hypothalamus,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.260]   this little cluster of neurons about the size of a marble
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.820]   that sits above the roof of your mouth,
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.340]   is also suppressing appetite through brain mechanisms.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.740]   So this is really beautiful, right?
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.900]   You have a peptide, a small little protein
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.820]   that's released in the gut,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.300]   and that release within the gut causes gut distention,
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.480]   which makes you feel full,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.540]   and by way of neural stimulation of the hypothalamus
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.100]   also activates neural pathways within the brain
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.420]   that trigger satiety, the feeling of having had enough food.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.560]   So to me, GLP-1 is both impressive and important.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.400]   Why?
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   Because this recent category of drugs
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.460]   that's now hitting the market seems to adjust obesity
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.840]   or can help people with weight loss
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.560]   in order to help their health.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.160]   And it's doing so by at least two mechanisms.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.240]   One is within the brain
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.200]   and the other is within the gut and communication
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.400]   through the so-called gut-brain axis.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.160]   Because again, these enteric neurons
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   are communicating to the brain, the hypothalamus,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.620]   by way of this, what's called
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.380]   the sympathogastro-spinal reticular hypothalamic pathway.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.500]   You absolutely do not need to know all of that.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.340]   That's a mouthful.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.300]   That's enough to make your mouth feel distended.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   But at the same time, things like yerba mate,
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.120]   and I'm sure there are other compounds out there as well,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.180]   but certainly yerba mate can stimulate the release of GLP-1.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.300]   So for those of you that are looking
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.180]   for some mild appetite suppression
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.220]   and want to accomplish that while also ingesting caffeine,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.180]   yerba mate might be a good option for that.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.020]   And just know that it's operating through two mechanisms,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.820]   on the body through mild gut distension
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.280]   to make you feel full and on the brain
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.040]   to increase satiety or make you feel less hungry.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.560]   And then for everybody,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.200]   not just those that are interested in appetite suppression,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.220]   I think it's important to understand
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.440]   that these parallel pathways are fundamental
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.920]   to how we are organized.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.280]   Another good example of this would be
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.760]   when we are excited by something, positive or negative,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.320]   so it could be stressful or we're positively aroused,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.640]   there is a parallel activation of epinephrine, adrenaline,
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.800]   both from your adrenals
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.240]   and from an area in the brain called the locus coeruleus.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.340]   So again and again,
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.800]   we see this in biology and in neuroscience,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.880]   that your brain and your body are acting in concert,
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.200]   they're acting together through mechanisms
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.640]   that either are independent,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.920]   so separately in the brain and separately in the body,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.420]   but directed towards a common goal
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.920]   or through communication between brain and body.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.080]   And almost always that communication
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   is going to be bi-directional,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.360]   body to brain and brain to body.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.200]   So I think these results are really interesting
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   and really important for sake of weight loss,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.160]   for sake of appetite suppression,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.560]   and just generally for the way that they illustrate
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.200]   this very important theme
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.040]   of the way that we are constructed at a biological level,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.180]   which is parallel pathways.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.760]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.040]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.620]   (upbeat music)
