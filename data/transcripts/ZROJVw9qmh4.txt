[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.420]   Today's question from the inbox comes from Andy who asks this, "Pastor John, should
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.220]   we love ourselves?
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.180]   Soren Kierkegaard once said, 'Don't forget to love yourself.'
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.060]   And many teachers use Jesus' instruction to love our neighbors as ourselves to suggest
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.000]   we need to love ourselves first.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.340]   But is this advice biblical?
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.180]   What do you say, Pastor John?"
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.700]   First a word about Kierkegaard, and then a word about Jesus and Paul and whether it's
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.040]   biblical.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.720]   What Kierkegaard meant—I went and found that letter—what Kierkegaard meant, and what
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.080]   is certainly right to mean, was that we ought always, we ought always to love ourselves
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.080]   rightly.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:59.340]   In other words, if someone thinks that he will find happiness in a life of self-pity,
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.900]   he should be told, "You are failing in your duty to love yourself rightly.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.700]   You are living a lie.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.060]   You are indeed loving yourself—everyone does—in the sense that you are pursuing
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.500]   the path that feels most gratifying to you, but you're wrong.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.940]   This will not gratify."
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.900]   Kierkegaard's quote, "Don't forget to love yourself," comes from Letter 196 to
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.100]   his cousin Hans Peter, who was crippled from birth.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.220]   Hans was giving in to the false view that a life without walking could not be lived
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.420]   in happiness and significance.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.660]   He was trying to manage his sorrows by hopelessness and self-pity rather than faith in Christ
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.660]   and hope in God's grace.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.020]   For the last 50 years, I'd say—I've been writing about this issue of self-love for
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:10.380]   at least 40 years—for the last 50 years, modern psychology, which is the air we breathe
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.540]   now—we've been breathing it for decades—modern psychology has produced such assumptions for
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.060]   so many people in our culture that we can't even conceive of alternative views at times
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.620]   to what it says about self-love and self-esteem.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.820]   So the Christian version of this pop psychology is, when Jesus said, "Love your neighbor
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.820]   as yourself," it means develop first a high sense of self-esteem, and then and only
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.780]   then will you be able to be of any use to others, to be loving to others.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.620]   Well, there are three assumptions here in this way of thinking, and I disagree with
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.820]   all of them.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.820]   Number one, that Jesus is commanding self-love.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.700]   Number two, that self-love means self-esteem.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.180]   Number three, and that you have to learn to love yourself like that in order to love others.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.820]   So now we go to Jesus and Paul.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.140]   See why I've got a problem with that.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.060]   Jesus is not commanding self-love.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.980]   He's assuming self-love.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.900]   The text says, "Love your neighbor as you," and I would add, "already do," because
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.820]   you're human, "love yourself."
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.140]   Jesus assumes that every human being by nature loves himself.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.300]   He doesn't command it.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.580]   He makes it the measure and the model of neighbor love.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.380]   I'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.700]   Number two.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.580]   So first was, Jesus is not commanding self-love.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.300]   Second, self-love in Jesus' command does not mean self-esteem.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.300]   It means seeking your happiness.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.020]   Everybody's wired to seek his happiness.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.980]   We know this for several reasons.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.860]   One is that in Luke 10, Jesus illustrates the commandment, "Love your neighbor as yourself,"
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.260]   by telling the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.900]   And the point there is that the Samaritan treated the wounded Jew the way he would want
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.560]   to be treated.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.480]   He sought the healing.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.340]   He sought the happiness and the well-being of the wounded man on the side of the road,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.780]   the way he would want to be healed, the way he would want to have well-being and happiness.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.780]   Here's another reason.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.640]   I think this is really strong.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.260]   Another reason why we know that Jesus didn't mean get a high sense of self-esteem when
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.080]   he said, "Love as you love yourself."
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:53.300]   In Ephesians 5, verse 28, Paul applies the command, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself,"
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   to how a husband loves his wife.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:07.060]   And he says this, "Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies, for no man ever
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.740]   hates his own flesh."
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.380]   I'm paraphrasing now.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.380]   Everybody loves himself.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.540]   "No man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it as Christ does the church,"
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.980]   because we're members of his own body.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.880]   So in this text, loving yourself means nourishing and cherishing.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.520]   It doesn't mean esteeming.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.740]   It means taking care of.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.660]   No one ever hates himself in the sense that everybody wants to be happy.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.060]   Everybody pursues happiness.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.140]   All people love themselves in this sense, and we should make that the measure of how
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.660]   we love others.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.820]   I feed myself.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.740]   I give myself rest.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.860]   I don't drink poison.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.180]   I don't step in front of trucks.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.820]   I don't seek out humiliation.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.340]   I do a hundred things during the day to provide for my needs and my wants.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.140]   I love John Piper.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:18.180]   And this is true even if I think I'm a jerk and have no self-esteem.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.860]   Self-esteem is not a given in humanity.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.300]   Love is a given.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.780]   That's why Jesus used it the way he did.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.380]   One can be taught self-esteem.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.420]   No one has to learn self-love, that is, to seek his own happiness.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.340]   Even if a person drinks himself crazy, smokes three packs of cigarette a day, and finally
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.620]   commits suicide, the reason is not that he doesn't love himself, but that his notion
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.300]   of what would make him happy is so distorted.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.700]   He doesn't love himself rightly.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.820]   He's trying to minimize his misery with drink and with suicide, which is the flip side of
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.060]   seeking happiness.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:15.700]   He wants to be happy, but the only way he can see it is to minimize his pain by taking
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.580]   his life.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:25.660]   We all want to be happy and do what we think in the moment, which is often stupid, will
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.020]   make us happy or at least less miserable.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.740]   This is the universal self-love Jesus had in mind, and there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.620]   In fact, you can't live without it.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:46.900]   So finally, the third assumption that I disagree with is that you don't have to learn self-love
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.060]   in order to love others.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:57.380]   This whole popular notion, true or false, that building self-esteem is a means to loving
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.620]   others has no textual basis in this command, "Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.900]   So what does Jesus mean?
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.740]   Love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.540]   And I'll tell you, there isn't any command in the Bible more damning to me, more humility
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.880]   producing and brokenness producing than this one.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.420]   This is a very radical command.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:30.620]   He means something far more than start liking yourself so you can like others.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:39.460]   He means be as concerned about the happiness and the well-being of others as you are about
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.500]   your own.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   That's devastating.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:52.700]   We ought to want to fill other bellies as much as we want to fill our own at breakfast
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700]   or supper.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.820]   Do you desire a meal?
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.300]   Want others to have meals.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:08.140]   Seek to relieve others' suffering as much as you take aspirin, ibuprofen, get treatment,
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.980]   go to the doctor.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.980]   Want that for others.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:19.580]   Take the desires that you have for your own comfort and security and success and happiness,
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:25.980]   the measure of how intensely and creatively and consistently you desire and pursue these
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.100]   things for others.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:36.300]   Now that is a radical commandment, and it's what Jesus meant.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.380]   My goodness, that is radical.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.420]   And it's also sobering and humbling as well.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.340]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.580]   why the love of money is suicidal.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.020]   Jesus said it is.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.300]   Paul said it is.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.860]   Judas proved that it is.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.860]   And tomorrow John Piper will explain why that's true.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.340]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
