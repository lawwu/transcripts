[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   So, without any pressure for it to be prescriptive, how do you approach eating given the knowledge
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.780]   that you have about food?
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.680]   I like to assume that you can sit down to a meal and not think about your AGRP neurons
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.880]   too much or any of that, but given that you have deep knowledge in this, has it shaped
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.360]   kind of how you think about food cravings your own?
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.200]   You don't have to reveal what those are even if they exist.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:38.680]   How you observe the eating behavior of others and yeah, how has knowledge shaped your feeding
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.680]   behavior?
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.800]   Well, I try not to think too much about my AGRP neurons when I'm eating.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   I would hope.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   I would hope.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.520]   I think it gets, I think, you know, the circuitry is so complex and we're just beginning to
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   see what's happening.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.880]   So, I wouldn't use that kind of information at this stage, where we're just beginning
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880]   to prescriptively.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.200]   But I think there is a set of basic recommendations from physiology and neuroscience, very simple
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   things.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.280]   You've probably talked about with people on your podcast before, for sort of shaping your
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.720]   diet to be healthier, to limit food intake.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.960]   So, one we've already talked about is limiting consumption of ultra-processed food, eating
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.280]   more whole foods for lots of different reasons.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.280]   Because they're more satiating, because they don't have this sort of engineered palatability
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640]   that causes you to overeat.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.080]   Another big one, which I'm sure you've talked about with some of your guests, is protein
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   consumption.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000]   Making sure you get adequate protein consumption, both because there's this concept of protein
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   leveraging.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.920]   So, if you don't eat a minimum amount of protein, that's going to cause you to eat more calories
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.720]   just to try to achieve that minimum amount of protein.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.240]   Also just because protein is more satiating and also because there's this idea of thermic
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   effect of food.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.080]   And so, you basically burn more calories metabolizing protein than sugar or fat.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.520]   How about consumption of fluids during meals?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.560]   I've heard it said before that we're not supposed to consume too many fluids because it's going
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.760]   to dilute the enzymes that allow us to digest our food.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.640]   I've heard other people say that's a complete myth.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.440]   That's a myth, I think.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040]   Humans don't have a perfect capacity to determine whether they're hungry or thirsty, and so
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.480]   drinking water will ensure you're not eating because you're thirsty.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.280]   And there's no idea of diluting it, I don't think that meant.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.520]   Distention itself, even though water provides a very limited distention signal, the expansion
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.440]   of your stomach and intestines is one important way that you terminate feeding.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.400]   And so, there is some component of that where you can get distention just from drinking
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   water.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   I'm sorry I blurted it out.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   Interesting, because I didn't realize that fluid consumption only provides a limited
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.600]   signal for distention.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.160]   It's not fluids, it's water.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   And so, the idea is that you can fill your stomach up with fluids, but the rate at which
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.240]   fluids empty out of your stomach depends on their calorie content.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.960]   So basically, if you drink water, it empties very rapidly into your intestine, and then
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.600]   goes through your intestine and is gradually absorbed.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.920]   If you drink something like a glass of orange juice, it will empty much more slowly.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.800]   And if you drink something that's really high in fat, really high in calories, it will empty
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.200]   extremely slowly over hours.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.520]   And that's because there's a negative feedback loop from the intestine that controls gastric
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   emptying.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.560]   So as those first nutrients leave your stomach and enter your intestine, that produces hormones
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.040]   that go back and then slow down the rate of gastric emptying.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   And the purpose for this is that you don't want nutrients entering the intestine too
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   fast.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   That's really unsafe.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.280]   It feels very unpleasant, and it's just that your intestine can only metabolize nutrients
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   so fast.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120]   And so, if there's calories, then it slows down gastric emptying a lot, but water just
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   kind of goes through.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.200]   What a beautiful system.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.080]   There's regulation at every point, hypothalamus, brainstem, gut, the rate of emptying based
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.240]   on the difference between water and orange juice.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   It's just awesome.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.280]   And that's part of the reason I think it's so hard to outsmart the system, right?
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.160]   Because these neurons are making predictions based on the sight and smell of food, but
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.960]   then the gut is doing its own thing.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.320]   It's calculating it separately and relaying that information.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.560]   So at every step, there are these checks, basically, that are just confirming that what
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.400]   you thought happened the first time actually was really going on.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   And so, which makes sense, because it's so important for survival, these homeostatic
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   systems.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.120]   They're the product of so much natural selection.
