[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   The recent situation in Ferguson, Missouri has been all over the news and it has again
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.960]   sparked a lot of conversation about race in America, Pastor John.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.760]   From this vantage point in time right now, we hear a number of conflicting reports about
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.840]   what actually happened in Ferguson.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.120]   But from your perspective as someone who has invested a lot of time in thinking about the
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.600]   trajectory of race relations in America, what are some key lessons we can take away from
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.440]   this at this point?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.640]   This has been a really tough season for a lot of people after the killing of Michael
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.000]   Brown, unarmed, 18 years old, in a hail of bullets from a policeman.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.520]   We don't know all the facts, yes, there are people who like to say that and people get
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.160]   really angry when you say that first.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.520]   I'm just trying to learn what is going on in the dialogue, not just in the wider community
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.120]   but in the Christian church.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.800]   And here are three things.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.320]   I want to mainly address, I think, my white fellow evangelicals and plead with them to
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:24.440]   think hard about three things that might feed in to why the black community would respond
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.120]   at least emotionally, if not theoretically, differently from the majority culture.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.720]   Number one, I learned this from, I think his name is Bixby, Pastor Bixby, who wrote a blog
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   about this and it's an incredibly important principle.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.100]   If you are a minority, it doesn't have to be black, if you're a minority living in a
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.080]   majority culture, so blacks in this country are what, 13, 14 percent, something like that,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.860]   so around them is a majority culture.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:09.760]   The minority ethos tends to be an us, a we, a community, an identity along the lines of
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.960]   what defines them as the minority.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.200]   The majority culture never has to do this.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.040]   They're never even aware that they are a group.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   When a white guy shoots a white guy, we don't say, "Oh, white on white crime."
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   We don't think about it.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.440]   It's the luxury, it's the privilege of being majority.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.640]   So to be aware that any time anything happens of a critical nature in the black community,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.440]   there is a sense of us that is intrinsic, it's reflexive, it's natural, it's understandable,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.840]   precisely because of the nature of the community as a minority community.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.520]   That's one of the most important lessons I've had reaffirmed as I have listened.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.400]   Number two, feeding into this event is a history.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.160]   I mean, there's slavery, and then within my lifetime, a long history of Jim Crow laws,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   they were called, roughly coming to an end at the Civil Rights Movement, but being ugly,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.360]   horrible, demeaning, to a degree that one can hardly imagine the indignities of it.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.740]   So the long history of slavery, the long history of Jim Crow injustices and abuses are part
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.240]   of the matrix of that minority self-consciousness.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.760]   We have been hated, we have been abused, we have been mistreated for a long time.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.040]   And I know that there are other voices who say, "Come on, if we don't get beyond that,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440]   we won't make any progress."
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.720]   That's true, that's true, but it's not canceling out the reality of the consciousness.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.840]   We just need to handle that consciousness in a way, and whites need to be aware that
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.200]   we've never had to deal with that, and they still do.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.740]   That's number two lesson.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.640]   Number three is this.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.320]   I went to church last Sunday, and I was wondering, is Kenny going to address the issue?
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.520]   Bless his pee-picking heart.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.280]   He began with the issue, and then he put it in a wider context, and I was so thankful.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.560]   He's just so racially, ethnically, culturally sensitive that he began his sermon.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.480]   And what he drew attention to, along with other things, I knew this, but he had the
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   names already, and I don't have them already now, but he listed, I think, five other unarmed
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.240]   black men who had died in the last month at the hands of police.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.520]   Now you don't have all the facts with those.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   Every one of them may be warranted in some way, but when you put a centuries-long history
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.760]   together with a minority consciousness of us, them, together with a long history of
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:19.160]   innocent black men being lynched, and in the moment, some unarmed black men being killed
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.360]   by people with authority, you just got to believe and understand that when another one
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.480]   happens, it's going to feel different.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.760]   It's going to feel—now, having said all that, I'm pleading for white evangelical
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.280]   patience and understanding and listening.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:50.040]   And I know that those observations don't warrant untrue or ill-advised or inflammatory
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.240]   talk from the black community towards the white community.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.520]   And I've talked with the brothers about that.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.960]   So that's it, Tony.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.580]   That's where I am in my effort to listen and understand and admonish and be admonished.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:14.860]   So I hope that's of some help to the majority white, especially evangelical, culture as
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.860]   we deal with these things.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.960]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.600]   Within our circles—YRR, neo-Calvinism, whatever you want to call it—were you surprised by
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.340]   the amount of what some would say was misunderstanding between blacks and whites on Ferguson?
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.360]   Did this come as a surprise to you?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   No.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.120]   I think that's going to continue to be there.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.160]   And I don't know if misunderstanding is the way I would have described it.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.600]   Lack of empathy is what I think I would put my finger on.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.720]   I said to one brother, "I'm hearing what they're saying, and I'm hearing true
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   things."
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   "They" meaning black community.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.660]   "I'm hearing what you're saying and the facts I'm agreeing with."
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.560]   But here's the problem.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:04.200]   Agreeing with that, in this context with a dead man on the street, against that backdrop,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   without some kind of effort to say that you have empathy, that you have compassion, that
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.600]   you have understanding, that's what's missing.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.960]   And no, that doesn't understand me.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.800]   We haven't gotten there yet.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.100]   In fact, I think there's probably some pushback on that.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.680]   Do we have to pander to this every time something comes along?
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.560]   Do we have to deal with those kinds of emotional things?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.400]   And I'd say, "Well, I think there's probably a way to do it that isn't pandering,
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.280]   and that isn't belittling, that isn't dishonoring by owning a sense of understanding
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.920]   and empathy."
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Very good.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.000]   And you can find that article by Bob Bixby online.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.600]   It's titled "The Gospel in Black and White, A Missiological Perspective on Ferguson."
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.360]   And of course, you can download and read Pastor John's book, Bloodlines, for free.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.400]   Go to DesiringGod.org and click on Books and look for the title, Bloodlines.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   And speaking of topics in the news, Israel and Palestine are at war again.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.680]   There have been ceasefires and truces, but the tensions seem unresolved.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.840]   So should we take our stand with Israel or with Palestine?
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   That's tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   Thanks for listening.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   Thank you.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:14.740]   Thanks for listening.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.740]   Thank you.
