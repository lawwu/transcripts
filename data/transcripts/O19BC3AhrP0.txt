[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.740]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.340]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.520]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.760]   about demand generation.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.860]   Now, early in my 20s, I had the opportunity
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.540]   to visit Kolkata, India for my cousin's wedding.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.220]   Now, I'm a naturally curious person, and I love food.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.420]   So I was just dying to try something
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.500]   that I've never had before.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.860]   Now, everyone warned me, and rightfully so,
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.220]   that I should stay far, far away from street vendor food,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.020]   because my stomach had not yet gotten used
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.640]   to my new environment.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.620]   There was also this legitimate fear
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.700]   that I could get sick due to lack of sanitation.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.180]   But I didn't care.
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.340]   I didn't listen.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.820]   I was so fascinated by the culture, the people,
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.060]   and the entrepreneurial hustle around me,
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.020]   I had to try something.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.300]   So I remember going down a street,
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.740]   and a man and his daughter offered me some jalebi
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.340]   from the roadside cart.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.740]   Now, if you're not familiar with jalebi,
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.620]   think of an American funnel cake
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.000]   that you would find at a county fair.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.560]   But instead of it being this large, twisted donut thing,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.860]   they're much smaller, and they're thinner,
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.960]   and they're crunchy, orange in color,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.380]   and they're soaked in rose syrup.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740]   Now, I could tell that a man knew I was a foreigner,
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.900]   and that I had no idea what I was looking at.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.620]   So between broken English, and sign language,
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.880]   which is mostly him pointing at stuff,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.380]   and letting me smell the fragrance of the ingredients,
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.500]   he started to educate me.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.980]   And only after I showed a little interest
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.420]   did he offer me the tiniest sample with dipping sauce.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.260]   But I wasn't ready for it,
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.300]   because I was craving something savory.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.980]   So I thanked him, I thanked his daughter, and I left.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.740]   But you know what?
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.620]   I could not get the jalebi out of my mind.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.780]   He had created a demand for it
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.900]   that I didn't even realize existed.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.700]   And I could feel their eyes follow me
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.400]   as I continued walking down the street.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.820]   Now, after buying and eating some goat curry and naan,
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.540]   who did I find standing next to me?
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.940]   It was a jalebi vendor's daughter.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.500]   And she knew that I was ready for some dessert.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980]   Her English was far better than her father's,
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.540]   and within two minutes, she sold me three servings
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.540]   that I gladly shared with some of the kids who were nearby.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.600]   Now, this to me is a perfect example
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.180]   of how demand generation and sales work together.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.060]   The purpose of demand generation
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.820]   is to generate and create interest
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.140]   in a product or service that you have to offer.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780]   The more targeted and relevant
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.740]   your message is to your audience,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920]   the more they will likely take action
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.900]   to exchange their information for valuable content
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.380]   that you have to offer.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.980]   So the million dollar question is,
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.820]   how does a marketer determine what content is targeted
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.500]   and valuable to their audience?
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.260]   Now, there are ways to conduct research
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.020]   and look into the data,
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.260]   but your ace in the hole, your wild card,
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.220]   is your sales team.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.300]   Why?
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.500]   Because they have their ears to the ground
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.240]   and they hear firsthand what a prospect is looking for.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.380]   They know what features or solutions are important.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.980]   They usually have this dialed down
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.020]   by persona, job title, and industry.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.820]   They also know why a prospect would choose
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.200]   to take their business elsewhere.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.080]   So having that information is highly valuable
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.180]   in refining your message to the right segment.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.100]   But remember, this is a two-way street.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.220]   As a marketer, by regularly providing sales
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.960]   with insights about industry trends
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.760]   and what people are engaging with,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.420]   the sales team can refine their approach
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.260]   to be more effective in qualifying a prospect,
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.900]   leveraging the insights that you provided to them.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.260]   So today, we will be joined by Hector Preciado.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.620]   He's the director of demand generation at LawClerk.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.420]   He brings a very unique perspective
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.980]   because he was a highly successful sales executive
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.620]   and he made that transition from biz dev
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.880]   to growth marketing and demand generation.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.940]   In this video, he will cover topics such as
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.620]   how to optimize that intersection
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.660]   between marketing and sales,
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.340]   how to leverage insight from sales
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.340]   to drive marketing success,
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.220]   and the importance of personas
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.660]   and how to validate their key pain points.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.380]   All right, let's get started.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.220]   Hey, guys.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.180]   Today, we're talking about growth marketing
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.480]   and demand generation.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.980]   With us, Hector Preciado.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.100]   Hector, how are you doing?
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.940]   - Hey, I'm doing well, Tim.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.760]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   Appreciate it.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   - Hector, I am excited about this call
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.860]   because I fundamentally believe
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.600]   sales and marketing go hand in hand.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.700]   The individual who's experienced both
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.020]   is, I think, is the most unique and valuable person
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.700]   in a marketing organization, I believe.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.580]   That's my opinion.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.700]   And so that's something you find yourself
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   doing today as well, right?
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.540]   So can you tell us a little bit about
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.440]   what you're doing right now
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.020]   and kind of how you see the intersections meet?
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.840]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.620]   No, I couldn't agree with you more, Tim, actually.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.580]   And in many ways, once I kind of figured out
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.160]   what I wanted to do in the product sector
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.800]   and tech specifically, it's kind of by design, actually.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   And so right now, I am the Director of Demand Generation
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.760]   for a small startup in the legal tech space called LockClerk.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.000]   My role is, as the name suggests,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.680]   demand generation is to generate demand for our solutions.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.280]   And so I work in tandem with our sales leaders
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.860]   so that we can figure out how to bring more leads
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.460]   to the sales team.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.180]   And I do that through a multi-channel approach.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.960]   So as a marketer, multi-channel, all these buzzwords, right?
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   We all know what it means.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.160]   But essentially, I manage a team of marketers
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.500]   who manage different channels.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.940]   So I have an email marketer.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.820]   I have an SEO manager that handles all of our organic work.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.300]   I have a growth marketing manager
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.780]   who's focusing on our paid campaigns,
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.580]   online advertisements, things like that.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.320]   I work in tandem with our co-founders to generate content
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.820]   that kind of helps fuel and drive our campaigns.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.300]   I manage partnerships, strategic partnerships,
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.620]   whether it be to generate leads externally
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.580]   or to figure out how to monetize some of those partnerships.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.060]   So working at a startup, as you know,
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.140]   you kind of wear a lot of hats.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.380]   And my current role is no exception.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.100]   So can you tell us a little bit
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.700]   about the intersection point between sales and marketing?
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.380]   You know, I'll give the listeners an example.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.980]   So Hector and I used to work together, right?
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.060]   At that time, you're like one of the superb,
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.040]   like a rockstar sales leaders.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.120]   And I was in like web and demand gen.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.420]   And every week, I would sit down
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.700]   and look at all the leads that came in.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.500]   And we would look at every single stage
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.460]   of the buyer's journey in terms of the lead stage, right?
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.740]   So from MQLs all the way down to SQL conversion rates
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.300]   to bookings in one, and the whole purpose of that
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.060]   was to align on quality of leads collected
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.300]   or understand fluctuations of leads, right?
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.440]   And as an example for those out there,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.180]   like sales qualified, like the last stage,
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.780]   that's very much not marketing influence,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.940]   it's totally sales influenced.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.360]   And if part of the sales team is on vacation,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.940]   that number could go down.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.560]   Or if we give you bad quality leads,
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.060]   that number would also go down as well.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.960]   And so we're trying to figure out the math
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.460]   and conversion rates between all those.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.540]   And I think that led to a very harmonious relationship.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.340]   So in your role, you mentioned talking,
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.580]   working closely with your sales leaders.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.840]   What does that look like to you?
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.940]   And given your background in sales,
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.060]   is that conversation different from your point of view
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.840]   than maybe someone who doesn't have a sales background?
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.180]   - Yeah, no, I think so.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.100]   To start with the first question around like,
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.180]   how's the intersection of sales and marketing?
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.140]   When you look at it from a revenue standpoint,
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.220]   like how does a company develop revenue, right?
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.420]   And if you have functions,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.940]   if you have marketing teams and sales teams,
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.180]   what you're talking about is two different funnels, right?
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.220]   You're talking about, from a marketing standpoint,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.700]   it's kind of where it all begins,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.700]   is how do you begin to raise your brand recognition
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.540]   so that people can start having an interest
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.140]   in learning more about you, right?
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.740]   And then once you kind of pick them, as you know,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.260]   better than I do, right?
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.280]   That's where kind of like the journey in marketing starts,
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   right?
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.260]   Like the education standpoint,
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.800]   I wanna start doing some research,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.740]   I wanna learn more,
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.900]   I'm gonna watch some videos,
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.380]   maybe read some product reviews,
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.860]   so on and so forth.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.980]   All of those types of activities
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.560]   eventually kind of bring you down the marketing funnel,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.700]   where you're just like, okay,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.980]   I wanna talk to somebody, right?
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.340]   And once you're open to talking to somebody,
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.980]   that's essentially where like the sales journey begins,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.820]   right?
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.820]   That's what, you know, sales representatives,
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.400]   that's what they, that's their job.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.740]   Their job is to engage with prospects
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.580]   and then try to convert them, right?
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.080]   And so, and that point is where
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.480]   you have your inflection point, right?
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.520]   And that's where the handoff happens
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.000]   and that's where you start to see the relationship
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.140]   between marketers or the marketing team and the sales team.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.680]   Down the funnel, you start getting that more signal.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.520]   So, say a sales rep starts talking to somebody,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.840]   it was a great conversation,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.820]   but they weren't ready to buy it, right?
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.440]   That feedback, right?
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.960]   That they could, it would be important to share
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.200]   with the marketing team so that we can ask the question,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.800]   well, why do you think they weren't ready to buy it?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.640]   Right?
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.840]   They want more information.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.720]   Was it not the right kind of fit?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.220]   They thought they were getting X when we were selling Y.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.260]   Are we delivering that X message
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.840]   and they're expecting Y, right?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.920]   And by we, I mean the marketing team, right?
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.160]   So, all those types of questions and those conversations
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.320]   and you and I used to, once a week, right?
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.040]   We had those conversations and I love those conversations.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.200]   Those are some of my most fond memories
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.840]   when you and I used to work together, right?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.240]   That kind of feedback, that loop, number one, has to exist.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.080]   And then the quality of that feedback
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.140]   and the information that you get to go back
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.280]   so you can make some changes to your marketing strategy,
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.120]   your marketing channels.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.360]   'Cause it could also mean,
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.040]   hey, most of the people that I'm talking to
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.000]   are coming through emails, right?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.960]   Like, okay, great.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.720]   Well, you know that your email channel is doing well.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.640]   Maybe you want to think about it, throwing more money
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.820]   through your email channels.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.300]   And then you say, oh, look at these campaigns
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.160]   that were running on paid advertisement,
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.120]   let's say on Google AdWords, for example,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.000]   are not really generating any leads for us
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.840]   or any good leads.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.520]   So then maybe we want to think about
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.560]   shifting some of the budget
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.480]   for some of the campaigns that are working, right?
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.800]   And so, as you know, it is a constant,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.640]   like, let me listen to what's happening.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.840]   What are the ears to the ground?
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.780]   What kind of feedback are we getting from the sales team
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.120]   about the quality of the leads or the lack thereof?
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.240]   What messaging is working?
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.780]   What pieces of content are working?
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.700]   Is it blogs?
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.660]   Is it videos?
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.340]   Is it white papers?
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.320]   So all of that needs to come back to the marketing team,
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.460]   right, so that we can begin to optimize
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.740]   to see what's happening, right?
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.720]   And because oftentimes what I've experienced
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.140]   in different places is sometimes, you know,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.660]   the sales team and the marketing team
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.900]   seems to be at odds, right?
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.580]   It's competing, right?
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.900]   Or there's like this finger-pointing blame game
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.120]   that happens where it's like,
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.520]   well, it's not our fault, the leads aren't good.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.080]   Or like, well, you know, we got good leads,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.040]   we got a high volume,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.800]   they're just not closing deals, right?
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.640]   And so sometimes you see like an antagonistic relationships
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.720]   amongst marketing and sales,
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.760]   where I prefer to look at it from like,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.960]   no, we're strategic partners.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.560]   Actually, we're kind of like cousins.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.760]   We're first cousins, right?
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.800]   At the end of the day, we want the same thing, right?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.400]   We want to succeed and success at the end.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.240]   And at the end of the day,
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.760]   it comes in the form of revenue, right?
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.280]   We're talking about the next generation.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.900]   So long as we're closing deals and we're making money,
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.480]   everybody's happy, right?
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.400]   And it doesn't have to be a contentious relationship
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.540]   to get there.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.760]   Actually, when you're actually working lockstep
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.000]   with one another is when the magic really happens.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.840]   - I totally agree.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.240]   You know, it reminds me of one test I ran
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.520]   once on LinkedIn with your input.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.120]   We were looking at optimizing a contact sales form.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.840]   And that point, like again,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.360]   LinkedIn learning at that point was a startup.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.800]   So we're trying to throw everything at the wall,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.280]   see what sticks, right?
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.600]   And the typical template looked like a form on the left
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.400]   and the right was some kind of value-based proposition
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.960]   about like why working with LinkedIn
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.780]   learning is better, whatever.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.520]   And that, you know, being LinkedIn,
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.640]   the brand carried, so it performed well.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.280]   I remember I had one conversation with you, Hector,
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.600]   where I said, hey,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.720]   when you're actually on that sales call with the customer,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.960]   what are the top three things that actually come up?
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.460]   Whether it's the FAQ or whatever it is.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.500]   And you kind of helped me understand,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.200]   hey, like these are the top five commonly asked questions
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.880]   or discussed topics.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.000]   So I said, okay, let me run with that.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.720]   I did a test where I took and exposed those
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.540]   on the landing page.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.040]   I said, hey, look, on this call with sales,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.920]   you will most likely talk about this.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.480]   And conversions went up, right?
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.800]   And I think that's an example where sales and marketing,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.940]   the feedback bi-directional is really helpful.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.080]   Do you mind giving us maybe some examples
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.520]   specifically of maybe like whether marketing had an insight,
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.720]   maybe you guys noticed something from a trends point of view
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.840]   where the insight fed into sales
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.520]   and maybe helped increase deal closings
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.000]   or the other direction?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.820]   - Yeah, no.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.520]   So, I mean, that was a great example that you shared
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.360]   when we worked at LinkedIn.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.980]   And I specifically remember that
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.760]   'cause one of the biggest pain points was
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.240]   how do I get more time, right?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.000]   And I remember sharing that feedback
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.560]   and I remember you implementing that
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.800]   in part of the messaging proactively, right?
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   So what you want to do in that case
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.220]   is you wanna get in front of the pain points
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.480]   or some of the questions that are gonna come up, right?
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.040]   And that's one approach.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   But let me share a different approach
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.120]   but the same concept, right?
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.600]   - Yeah.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.880]   - For us, we're in the legal tech space
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.800]   and so our core customers are attorneys, right?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.960]   Attorneys are among some of the most discerning customers
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.880]   that I have ever experienced, right?
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.480]   And working at LinkedIn, we work with marketers,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.320]   with talent recruiters, with salespeople.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.160]   - Yeah.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.980]   - And advertisers, right?
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.440]   I mean, we work with four different lines of business, right?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.720]   And the first time I actually worked with attorneys
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.400]   and they're very discerning, right?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.620]   For a lot of different reasons,
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.120]   including that that is their job, right?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.840]   Their job is for them to like poke holes in arguments
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.520]   and like, you know, find the loopholes, right?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.360]   - Yeah.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.480]   - And speak contrarians, right?
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.160]   Like that's essentially what lawyers do.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.280]   And so when we're trying to engage them,
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   it was a bit of a challenge.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.560]   So, you know, we started running some tests
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   on some calls to action or CTAs as it's often called
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.160]   in some of our webpages specifically when for us,
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.720]   the highest converting type of lead is book a demo.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.760]   Surprise, surprise, right?
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.560]   Like that's for everybody, right?
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.880]   And so, but we were trying to see
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.400]   what kind of messaging around the call to action
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.000]   would resonate the best with attorneys, right?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.560]   And so, you know, we had like, oh, book a demo,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.640]   book a demo, book a demo.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.720]   And we were doing it for a long time
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.200]   and we're getting some leads and whatnot, right?
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.720]   But we were having conversations internally
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.320]   that was suggesting that, you know, these guys,
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.000]   people don't convert until they talk to somebody,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.920]   until they talk to one of our experts.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.760]   - Right.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.880]   - Once they talk to one of our experts,
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.160]   then that's when the conversations really get substantive.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.880]   And then that's when we're able to move people down a funnel
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.840]   and then convert them into customers.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.120]   And so for the longest time we kept having the conversation
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.160]   and then we finally realized,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.640]   well, why don't we use talk to an expert as our CTA
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   as opposed to just like book a demo, right?
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.360]   I'm like, okay, great.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.920]   So some time ago, actually,
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.720]   I had a conversation with you when I was picking your brain
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.080]   about tools to use and whatnot.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.400]   And on an A/B testing solution
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.160]   that we are currently using now that, well, we did that.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.000]   Yeah, great.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.600]   Let's change the CTA button on,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.840]   and let's run the test where the control is book a demo
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.040]   and the variable is talk to an expert.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.120]   And guess what?
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.840]   Talk to an expert converted at a much higher rate
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.120]   than just simply book a demo.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.680]   And we actually got a higher volume of book a demo requests
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.880]   because the concept for an attorney
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.960]   that the person that I'm talking to is not a sales person,
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.080]   person is an expert, right?
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   And so we tested another variable,
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.640]   like talk to an advisor was actually another one.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.200]   So we did multiple A/B testing rounds
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.120]   and talk to an expert was one
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.960]   that actually resonate the best
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.720]   and increase the volume and the conversion rate for demos.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.840]   And so, we wouldn't have landed on that
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.320]   had we not had the internal conversations
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.440]   with our sales leaders, right?
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.680]   And had these conversations.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.480]   'Cause if not, then us as marketers,
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.720]   we're just kind of out on an island
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.920]   trying to figure out like, we think this is the way to go.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.840]   I don't know, let's test it, right?
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.840]   - Yeah, that's a wonderful example.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.920]   It actually reminds me.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   So like the, because I've been mostly
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.200]   in a B2B high-tech space.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.760]   So specifically around like hardware storage or security.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.800]   And so my target customer is like a hardware
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.920]   or backend architect, let's say, right?
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.680]   So you have like your engineers,
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.920]   but architects is one who look at all those solutions.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.480]   They've got a lot of pride in their work,
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.120]   which is important for the persona.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.080]   And then they want to figure something out.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.160]   And it's interesting, if you go back to the topic
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.320]   of who our personas are, to even figure that out,
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.880]   you need to look at the various stages
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.800]   of the buyer's journey, right?
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.760]   'Cause you make a lot of assumptions
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.880]   that not everyone is the same.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.600]   And once you start kind of delineating
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.440]   the different persona types against every stage
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.320]   of the buyer's journey, the exercise forces you to think,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.840]   okay, well, at each stage,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.560]   what question are they looking to answer?
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.920]   'Cause remember, they're trying to get a job done
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   at the end of the day, right?
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.320]   So what are they trying to get answered?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.680]   And then what are the top tasks they're trying to do
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.840]   to get that, to answer that question?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.200]   You can use that as a formula to audit
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.040]   any website efficacy.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.480]   The reason why it's important is because
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.040]   for the architect, we discovered through conversations
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.480]   with sales, technical sales, technical engineers,
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.800]   and the product team, we discovered that that persona
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.640]   in particular was very, very prideful,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.720]   meaning they did not want to be handheld through something
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.160]   'cause they're actually surrendering
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   or admitting that they don't know.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.160]   And so the test we ran was like,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.960]   so do they want a trial then?
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.680]   Do they want an on-demand demo?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.800]   Do they want a live demo?
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.600]   Or do they want to talk to sales?
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.880]   And we found out that each of those hit them
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.480]   at a different stage of the buyer's journey.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.360]   Trial was a lot further along.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.560]   Demo, I'm just learning.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.600]   But getting a live demo was the last one
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.400]   'cause that particular persona didn't want it, right?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.720]   So I think what you're saying is like,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.440]   you gotta do a lot of testing for which of your customers
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.560]   are actually on your site.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.760]   In some cases, a demo and sales form can be one and the same.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.240]   Sometimes you might want to split it up
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.680]   'cause your intent is completely different, right?
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   So I love that example you shared, man.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.720]   - Yeah, no, and you're absolutely right.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.400]   And for us, you're talking about the buyer's journey,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.480]   the persona, like we have a few different personas.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.400]   Like we work primarily right now with solo practitioners
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.120]   and small firms, right?
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.040]   And there is a difference between a solo practitioner,
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.720]   like a singular attorney who's doing it all themselves,
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.640]   or like a small firm in which
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.920]   they do have additional support, right?
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.440]   But they lack, you know, they both like time
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.920]   and they both want to get to the same point
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.760]   where it's like, they want to do more work, right?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.240]   But how they get there is a little different, right?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.080]   And you're totally right.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.800]   Like understanding the buyer persona
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.560]   and the journey that they're in
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.640]   and where they are in the journey
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.360]   is key to the types of campaigns
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.280]   that you should be running, so.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.960]   - And so I'm kind of curious,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.840]   kind of going back to your personal journey,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.000]   'cause again, I'm just so fascinated
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.680]   by your actually re-imagining of your career,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.360]   going from sales to marketing.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.720]   Can you help me understand even in the beginning,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.560]   like what led you even into sales?
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.320]   'Cause I don't have like,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.280]   when I think of a salesperson or engineer,
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.440]   those are the two roles that I believe
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.480]   I don't have the skill sets or personalities for.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.760]   And that's an uneducated statement,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.200]   which is why I want to get the crux of this, right?
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.520]   So like, 'cause I make assumptions around like,
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.440]   I need to know this, or I need to be able to do that.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.920]   I need to be totally comfortable with X, Y, and Z.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.040]   And then I kind of self-select out of career opportunities.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.400]   So can you help me understand like,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.120]   was your path to sales a direct one,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.800]   or was it kind of like a hodgepodge of experiences?
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.640]   - No, you know what?
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.960]   It was an indirect, actually.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.200]   And it was kind of, in some ways,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.040]   it was kind of like,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   as I'm walking down my career journey,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.280]   kind of paying attention to what is available
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.120]   and what I needed,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.680]   and then like optimizing all along the way, right?
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   And so, I mean, not that that's the best route for anybody,
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.200]   but it has proven to be a good one for me.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.440]   - What does that mean to you?
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.760]   Like optimizing along the way?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.200]   - Yeah, so one of the things to understand about my career,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.000]   and I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about this part,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.280]   but actually I started my career
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.720]   working in nonprofit public policy work, right?
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.080]   I did a lot of communications work.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.960]   I was director of communications for a nonprofit,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.840]   as well as the director of development,
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.280]   which means I'm raising money.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.400]   Which means I was basically the salesperson
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.440]   for the organization.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.040]   And what I was selling, I was selling a vision, right?
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.600]   I was selling a mission and vision of the organization
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.640]   to potential clients and customers
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.040]   who give us money to do that,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.840]   which, from a nonprofit standpoint,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.440]   is the philanthropic community,
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.040]   which means like foundations that have a lot of money, right?
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.960]   Or like wealthy donors, right, who wants to give.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.000]   So like my sales journey kind of started
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.160]   in the nonprofit sector,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.200]   which I won't go into too much detail,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   but just kind of to give you a sense
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.800]   of how I kind of got started.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   - Yeah.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   - I knew at some point early in my career
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.360]   that I wanted to go to the private sector,
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.360]   but I didn't know what that meant and where and how, right?
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.520]   And so when most of my colleagues
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.360]   were applying to public policy schools,
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.800]   I decided I want to go to business school, right?
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.560]   And that was part of what actually kind of helped me
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.240]   optimize, right, how I want to get to the next phase.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.360]   And actually, when I joined LinkedIn,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.440]   at the time, they were giving you the book,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.240]   "The Startup of You" by Reid Hoffman.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.920]   And it's one of the books that I go to periodically
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.120]   and I recommend all the time because, you know,
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.760]   in it, Reid Hoffman talks about
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.000]   how do you make a career pivot,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.080]   which is exactly what I was doing, right?
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.280]   I was trying to go from my nonprofit public policy,
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.680]   very specialized, to like go to the private sector, right?
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.640]   And so a couple of the things is you,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.000]   one, you pick up a new skill set
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.840]   or an educational certification.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.800]   For me, it was getting an MBA.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   And two, you pick up a new network.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.720]   Well, I picked up that network
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.360]   by way of like my MBA experience and my classmates, right?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.480]   And so that's kind of how I began to like optimize
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.000]   for the next step of my career.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.360]   And actually, when I started working in tech,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.520]   I started working in marketing.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.920]   I was a search engine marketer
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.000]   and I had to learn, you know, Google AdWords and Yahoo Bing
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.200]   and how to run ads on those platforms.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.600]   I had to learn on the fly on the job
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.800]   in my first job working at a startup.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.760]   And it was in that space.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.840]   And so that was, so for me,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.120]   like when you think about like the type of skill sets
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.160]   that you might want to pick up, like as a marketer,
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   like online, auction-based, right?
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.600]   Advertising, technology platforms,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.840]   it's kind of like the baseline, it's table stakes.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.960]   - And I didn't know it then,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.720]   but I know it now and I appreciate it,
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.560]   that that foundational knowledge, right,
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.480]   that I was picking up when I was trying to sell
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.640]   jewelry for Macy's online,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.280]   or women's shoes and women's clothing.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.160]   And, you know, like those are like the catalogs
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.360]   that I had to sell, right?
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   Like I was actually setting the table for myself
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.680]   to kind of move more into like a marketing,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.800]   like a future marketing roles.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.600]   'Cause in business school,
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.080]   what they teach you in marketing
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.360]   is kind of like the fundamentals
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.680]   when it comes to like the frameworks
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.040]   that you're gonna need, right?
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.280]   What is the product?
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.840]   You know, how do you price it?
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.360]   How do you position it?
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.200]   - Right.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.440]   - You know, like those kinds of things is,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.640]   again, like the higher level thinking around marketing,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.480]   that's what they teach you,
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.920]   but they don't teach you search engine marketing
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.760]   in business school.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.600]   - No.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.120]   - Right, you have to learn it either on the fly at work,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.000]   or, you know, like Google AdWords has like the,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.240]   you know, the ad center that, you know,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.080]   kind of has tutorials and certifications
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.920]   and all these other things
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.800]   in order for you to better learn it.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.520]   So just kind of unsolicited advice for anybody out there
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.320]   that wants to get into like the marketing space,
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.000]   like you and I, demand generation, growth marketing,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.800]   like definitely set the groundwork foundation
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.520]   and learn auction-based like advertising,
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.600]   technology solutions like Google AdWords and whatnot.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.920]   So, and so that's kind of how I got started.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.200]   And actually that's how I got my foot in the door
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.440]   at LinkedIn, right?
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.960]   Like I came in LinkedIn as the first, you know,
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.240]   content marketer,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.960]   'cause we were launching at the time was sponsored,
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.120]   sponsored updates and now sponsored content, right?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.040]   We were launching it.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.240]   And so I was the first person hired to come in
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.000]   and help the largest advertisers
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.560]   that were part of the beta test, right?
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.960]   For the proof of concept to manage their campaigns.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.440]   And, you know, and had it not been for that foundation
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.800]   of work that I had, you know, doing search engine marketing
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.640]   at the startup that I worked at,
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.080]   I would have not been as successful, I think,
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.080]   as I was in advertising operations
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.040]   when it comes to marketing solutions, right?
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.320]   And so, and so, and so that's, so the optimization, right?
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.880]   Like I went from like, okay, I got an MBA from, you know,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.160]   UC Berkeley, high school, like top name brand,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.640]   but I didn't know how to do the job.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.920]   And so I had to learn it on the job
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.400]   and that's how I optimized.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   And then I was able to leverage that experience
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.640]   to go to LinkedIn and then like learn that experience
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.160]   and learn content marketing and that's how I optimize.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.320]   And so when I talk about optimization,
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.360]   a lot of it is really like not taking any part
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.600]   of your experience for granted,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.080]   learning as much as you can,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.120]   because you never know what a particular skill set
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   you're learning today, right?
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.000]   When that's gonna pay off for you tomorrow.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.840]   And that's kind of been the case for my entire career.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.320]   - No, I love that.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.760]   And that's the crux of a growth mindset, right?
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.080]   Like you epitomize that.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.120]   And I think that's probably why you and I get along
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.720]   'cause we have a very similar perspective.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.880]   'Cause what you said at the very end,
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.320]   which is basically being intentional
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.480]   about what you wanna learn
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.400]   out of every single job opportunity is key.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.080]   I remember not to date myself.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.400]   So I graduated college in like 2001
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.880]   with a dot-com bubble burst, right?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.360]   - A young man.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.920]   - I am a young man.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.080]   But like marketing jobs,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.480]   so I graduated with a marketing degree
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.640]   and like those are the jobs
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.720]   we're getting to let go at the time
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.160]   'cause the bubble burst, right?
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.120]   'Cause I couldn't find anything.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.160]   And so I took all these oddball jobs, you name it.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.720]   I worked at a mom and pop sausage factory,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.200]   stuffing sausages.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.680]   And I worked as a computer technician,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.800]   building computers back in.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.840]   I also, the most memorable one was being in a call center
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.040]   at Wells Fargo, calling people on a Saturday morning
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.760]   on an automated dialer,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.960]   telling them that they overdrafted by $2,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.920]   now they own 20.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.760]   It was like a not a conversation they wanna have.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.320]   But to your point about learning
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.920]   and kind of optimizing your career,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.520]   those jobs one could say, that seems really random.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.120]   And that actually, is it beneath you?
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.600]   Like, no, nothing's ever beneath you, right?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.160]   'Cause if you're there to learn, you're there to learn.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.880]   I remember like the Wells Fargo one,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.520]   it taught me how to have a thick skin, right?
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.760]   It taught me how to talk to complete strangers
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.400]   who did not wanna talk to me.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.240]   - Yeah, that's hard.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.320]   - And somehow bring them around.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.080]   And that's like marketing, that's sales, right?
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.960]   So I totally agree with you.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.840]   There's something to get out of everything.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.200]   And I was, I look at my girls these days,
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.760]   I'm like, "Oh, I wonder what their first job's gonna be."
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.680]   I was like, "Whatever it is."
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.480]   Like, they wanna work at Boba?
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.440]   They wanna work in a library?
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.280]   I don't even care.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.840]   It's like, I wanna make sure they have a strong point
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.000]   of view on what skills they wanna gain.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Yeah, so thanks for that perspective.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.840]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.680]   - So when you made the shift from sales
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.040]   then back over to marketing,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.960]   like what was that inflection point for you?
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.320]   Like, why did you make that a pivot back?
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.720]   - Yeah, no, and when you and I met, actually,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.000]   I had pivoted from marketing over to sales.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.840]   And just some context of why I did that is,
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.400]   when I started thinking about my career trajectory,
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.640]   I started looking at leaders within LinkedIn
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.840]   and talking to them and doing information interviews
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.680]   and just, I mean, the culture there allows itself for that.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.240]   You can talk to anybody, right?
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.960]   And so my ambitions then, as they are today,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.080]   was I wanna be in the C-suite, right?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.880]   And so when I start thinking about like pathways
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.560]   into the C-suite, right, I hit a point where it's like,
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.880]   hey, I'm in the marketing side.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.680]   I can continue to learn and grow and develop
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.280]   on the marketing side and pick up those skillsets
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.480]   and then kind of work my way up to, let's say,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   like a chief marketing officer role eventually, right?
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.320]   And I was like, oh, that could be a potential path.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.760]   But I was thinking, but you know what?
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.360]   My interests are also broader
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.560]   and my skillset, I think, are also broader.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   And so I need to be on the revenue generating side as well,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.120]   or at least I need to understand that.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.040]   And I remember years ago, a mentor of mine
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.080]   in the nonprofit world who, when I was talking to him
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.040]   about like, hey, I wanna go to the private sector,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.880]   he specifically said to me, 'cause he had done the same,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.920]   he said, in the private sector,
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.400]   there's two types of jobs.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.280]   There's those jobs that spend the money
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.320]   and then those jobs that make the money.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.160]   He said, you wanna be on the side
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.200]   that makes the money, right?
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.760]   And so for me, what makes the money is the sales side, right?
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.080]   And so for me, I realized that I don't understand
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.840]   the sales side of the equation very much.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.120]   And that's when I decided, listen,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.080]   I think what I need to do is optimize again
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.720]   and then move in that direction
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.280]   so that I can learn that side of the equation, right?
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.960]   And that's when you and I met, right?
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.600]   And that's when we started working together
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.000]   and I was learning the sales side as I was working with you
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.080]   and understanding your value
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.440]   to what it is we're trying to do as a business unit.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.600]   And so, and I did that for a number of years
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.720]   as a leader at LinkedIn
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.360]   and then I went to a different company
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.840]   and then I was leading a global sales team.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.000]   And then I went back to another organization
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.200]   when I was actually managing both the sales team
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.880]   and the marketing team.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.240]   And that was super interesting for me
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   because now both funnels are under my control
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.880]   and my direction.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.920]   And so that was fun.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.760]   And now I'm back on the marketing side
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.800]   and part of why I'm just solely on the marketing side
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.920]   is 'cause I think marketing is more fun than sales.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.600]   (laughing)
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.520]   And you can do a lot more interesting things
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.520]   on the marketing side and I just pursued opportunities
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.360]   that were there for me.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.240]   And this is post-pandemic now
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   and actually it was like over the...
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.160]   I've been here now for about a little over a year and a half
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.920]   and it's been great.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.360]   And so for me, those were the reasons
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.920]   why I kind of like kept straddling
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.760]   between sales and marketing
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.840]   'cause they're kind of like two sides of the same coin.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.360]   - For me to make myself more employable, right?
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.880]   To make myself a more well-rounded leader on the text,
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.080]   on the text realm,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.800]   I thought that I needed to make myself well-rounded.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.240]   And now I can totally say like,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.080]   and I own it, I can totally say like,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.480]   look, it took me a while, right?
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.160]   But now I can say like, I am a go-to-market leader, right?
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.280]   And so for those folks who understand
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.680]   what go-to-market means, right?
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.880]   It's like, hey, this person has a deep understanding
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   and not just how the marketing side of the equation works
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.600]   but also how sales side of the equation works.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.680]   And when you think about like my career,
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.480]   when I think about my career prospects,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.560]   I think that I've continued to make me like employable
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.600]   should I decide to make the next move
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.200]   or go for business.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.400]   Negative happens to the company now,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.080]   but so on and so forth, right?
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.560]   - Yeah, that is just amazing.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.800]   And I think I'm jealous of you
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.680]   in a way that you discovered early on
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.880]   that you're not sure where you want to go,
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.120]   you kind of know you want to do a pivot.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.080]   And so you took action,
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.520]   in your case, went to business school
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.880]   to kind of help you understand your possibilities to pivot
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.000]   and what you gain in developing a point of view,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.160]   ultimately kind of understanding
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.880]   what end goal you want to go.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.920]   And that allowed you to have the right conversations
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.640]   and exposures and informational interviews
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.560]   to kind of get that feedback of context, right?
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.920]   What advice would you give to someone
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.360]   who they're not sure if it's a time to pivot yet,
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.520]   but they just feel like there's got to be something more?
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.360]   - Yeah.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.400]   - And let's just say, let's put everything on the table
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.640]   'cause they may not have the,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.400]   maybe the financial means to do business school, right?
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.280]   So like what advice would you give to them?
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.800]   - Yeah, no, so I think the first thing I would say
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   is before giving any advice is whenever it happens for you,
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.960]   like it's gonna take time, right?
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   So there is never, it is never too soon or too early
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.360]   to start putting the wheels in motion, right?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.920]   Because it's gonna take time, right?
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.840]   If it's a matter of a skillset you need to pick up,
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.120]   whether it be by you going back to school
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.600]   or taking an online class or like, you know,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.560]   going on YouTube and looking up tutorials, right?
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.280]   Like YouTube, as you know well,
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.760]   YouTube is quickly becoming like, you know,
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.840]   the most, the highest volume search engine, right?
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.880]   And everywhere, and so people are learning things
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.840]   on YouTube all the time, right?
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.720]   And so, however it is that you learn something,
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.160]   like that process itself is gonna take some time.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   - Yes.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.720]   - So the other thing that's gonna take time,
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   which is another variable of you making a pivot
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.480]   is the network and the people
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.920]   that you're gonna be able to leverage
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.280]   in order for you to make that pivot,
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.200]   whatever it is they may be, right?
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.080]   You were an engineer and now you want to be a chef, right?
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.800]   Like you're gonna have to learn that skillset somewhere,
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.640]   right?
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.600]   And when you start thinking about like your career prospects,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.280]   you're gonna have to meet people
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.480]   who are gonna be able to guide you
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.720]   or introduce you to other folks,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.000]   like that's also gonna take some time.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.920]   - Yeah.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.000]   - And so, but whether it be those two variables,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.920]   at the end of the day,
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.280]   it starts with you and taking the leap of faith, right?
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.920]   And that's like my advice, number one,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.880]   like take the leap of faith, right?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.880]   If you're contemplating something,
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.040]   like wake up one morning and decide,
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.520]   I'm gonna put this in motion,
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.600]   because even if it doesn't work out for you,
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.880]   even if it doesn't go anywhere, right?
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.960]   Like you're giving yourself an at-bat, right?
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.160]   To use like a sports analogy, right?
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.880]   Like you're not gonna get a base hit
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.360]   if you don't step up to the plate and take a swing.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.200]   - Yeah.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.880]   - You're just gonna be a spectator, right?
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.640]   And so that'd be my advice, number one,
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.120]   like take a leap of faith.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.920]   Like have faith in yourself that something may happen.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.160]   Even if it doesn't, at least you tried, right?
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.200]   And then the other part is I've alluded to,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   the other two things I would say
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.520]   is you have to always be learning, right?
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.200]   You can't assume that you've hit,
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.560]   like the learning, learning is a journey,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.960]   it's not a destination.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.800]   - Yep.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.640]   - Right?
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.240]   Like you just don't like, I've arrived,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.880]   I've learned everything I need to learn,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.360]   I don't need to do anything anymore.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.480]   No, that's not the way it works.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.640]   Like you have to constantly be learning new things,
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.840]   either as an IC, an individual contributor,
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.080]   who's gonna be running campaigns or whatnot,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.960]   or as a leader, who's gonna be managing and leading teams.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.400]   And I'll just give you a quick example.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.560]   Like coming into this role that I'm at,
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.120]   I didn't really know search engine optimization, right?
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.680]   I didn't, which is different from search engine marketing,
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.880]   which I knew, right?
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.240]   'Cause marketing is like,
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.720]   you have a budget for your campaigns,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.520]   you're running campaigns, you're trying to get conversions,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.880]   you're looking at click-through rate
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.040]   and all that other stuff.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.680]   SEO is different, SEO is like the organic traffic
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.840]   that is coming to your website, how are they getting it?
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.680]   - Yeah.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.640]   - How do you optimize your website, right?
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.600]   Like it's different, they're connected,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.200]   but they're different things, right?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.120]   And so it was one of the skillsets
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.320]   that I didn't really know a lot about.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.840]   So I had to learn, right?
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.200]   What tools do we use to execute on it?
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.760]   Like what are some of the key performance indicators
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.240]   that I need to pay attention to?
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.360]   What are best practices?
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.920]   Who are the best people that are looking at it?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.560]   Like, you know, so I was excited
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.720]   because I got to learn something new and something different
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.240]   that is now part of my toolbox.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.400]   - Yeah.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   - And so from a learning standpoint, that's what,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.920]   like I said, you gotta always be learning.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.760]   And then the last part is, as I already alluded to,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.160]   is like, you gotta build a network.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.120]   And even if you're the most introverted person,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:01.960]   like yourself,
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.760]   like I think you probably consider yourself an introvert,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.720]   but you are one of the most socially adept human beings
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.800]   that I've met in my life, right?
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.640]   - Thank you.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.160]   - And part of it is because you and your growth, right?
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.880]   You stress yourself out, you realize,
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.600]   hey, there's value in this.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.160]   I can't just not speak to people.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.840]   You use the example of you being at Wells Fargo
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.800]   and you got comfortable with talking to people
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.640]   you don't know,
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.680]   especially people who don't wanna talk to you, right?
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.760]   And so, you know, so I would say today,
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.000]   like the tin that I know has social grace,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.280]   whereas like maybe the tin graduating from college
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.120]   was probably like,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.520]   oh no, I don't wanna talk to anybody
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.440]   and look at you now, right?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.720]   And so like learning how to build relationships,
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.680]   maintain them over the course of your career
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.840]   is gonna be another key component.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.400]   So I would say like, if you do those three things,
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.040]   take the leap of faith,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.400]   continue to learn and build a network
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.840]   for where it is that you wanna go,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.960]   I think those are some three good ingredients
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.320]   for you to be successful.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.280]   - Oh man, plus one to all of that.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.200]   I think taking the leap of faith
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.360]   is essentially why I'm building this video channel, right?
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.400]   'Cause you know what I've been discovering
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.800]   in my conversation with people,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.280]   especially right now, I'm gonna time date this video.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.000]   This is 2023.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.080]   We're hopefully coming out of the pandemic.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.080]   The market is in a terrible place
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.920]   and job stability is,
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.080]   can't take it for granted anymore.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.800]   Doesn't matter how awesome you are.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.840]   Business decisions are made regardless of performance.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.080]   And so I'm discovering in my conversations with people,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.520]   'cause you know, I opened myself up
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.800]   to kind of mentor people, right?
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.400]   And the common feedback I got
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.880]   was a side of fears around the true fears
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.720]   of financial security,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.800]   especially for like single income family,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.640]   head of households,
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.640]   or you have parents who need financial support,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.400]   besides the financial piece of it.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.240]   There's a true fear around,
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.040]   I wanted to make a pivot or I wanted to make a change.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.320]   I don't know if my skills can translate.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.120]   I have a preconceived notion about what a job is
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.040]   that kind of want to do,
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.320]   but based on my limited exposure to that,
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.160]   that's all it is.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.280]   And I'm missing this whole pie of what actually it is,
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.000]   but I'm still here.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.400]   And because I'm not talking to anyone,
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.720]   I have assumptions about what that job requires
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   based on the job description.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.480]   On paper, I don't think I qualify anymore.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.320]   I'm not even gonna try.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.160]   You know why?
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.000]   'Cause there's like thousands of people
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.240]   who just entered a job market due to layoffs
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.600]   and they're probably applying as well.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.400]   And I essentially eliminate myself
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.880]   from any career opportunity before I even get started.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.800]   To your point,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.520]   you just gotta take that leap of faith, right?
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.920]   Leverage the network you know.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.240]   Talk to people.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.720]   Do I really understand the thing?
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.840]   And again, the purpose of this whole video series
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.160]   is to talk about all the ins and outs of all these fields
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.280]   and make you realize,
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.520]   shoot, it's a lot more broad than I previously realized.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.240]   Now I know how to have a conversation with someone.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.440]   So I'm really glad you talked about that piece of it,
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.080]   Hector, 'cause I totally agree.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.200]   The last thing I wanna kind of talk about with you, Hector,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.040]   is in my conversations with you,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.520]   you're one of the individuals I would define
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.520]   as your genuine self outside of work
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.240]   is probably very closely aligned to who you are at work.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.560]   Like Hector is Hector, right?
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.680]   Now I'm pretty sure it was a journey to get there.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.520]   And a lot of people,
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.840]   there are two different people at work and at home.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.680]   Can you tell us a little bit
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.120]   about like what that self-discovery
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.000]   or kind of arriving to who your true sense of self was
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.600]   and how that carries on to work
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.160]   and just your thought around just, you know,
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.280]   whether it's culture building
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.600]   or things that are kind of personally important to you
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.920]   and how they kind of transcend just work.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.320]   Can you just tell us a little bit about that?
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.160]   - Yeah, you know, thanks for asking that.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.920]   You know, for me,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.720]   like I'm a first generation college grad in my family,
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.840]   right?
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.360]   There were no professionals in my sphere growing up
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.400]   and even at a young adult.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.520]   And so I guess you can say like my family
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.280]   is kind of new to the professional game, right?
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.800]   And so walking into like a career pathway
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.920]   as a person of color, right?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.160]   You heard heard from others, you know,
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.880]   as you're starting a career about like, you know,
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.640]   like you have to do this dance
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.840]   or there's like your work persona
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.760]   and then there's like your home persona, right?
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.240]   And you have to keep them separate and this and that.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.640]   And that's real, man, that's a real argument.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.480]   And there's people out there
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.880]   who truly struggled on a regular basis.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.400]   And for me though, man, you know,
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   what I realized earlier on is that when I was my true self,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.280]   I ended up seeing the best results for me professionally.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.880]   And, you know, when I try to be somebody
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.600]   that I wasn't in the workplace, it just, you know,
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.280]   I couldn't fake it, you know,
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.520]   and people would take notice and be turned off by that
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.440]   and I wasn't being as successful in the workplace
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.320]   as I was when I was just being my true self.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.840]   And, you know, and I think part of it
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.000]   and this is part of my excellent superpower, I think,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.520]   in the workplace is, you know,
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.040]   I've been told that I have like contagious, positive energy.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.000]   - You do.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.440]   - I'm just a positive person, man.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.520]   And like part of it is 'cause I feel blessed
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.480]   for how I started my life and my family
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.680]   and to where I am today.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.200]   And I'm super blessed to be, you know,
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   to have had the opportunities that I continue to have.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.560]   And I think for me, it's a daily reminder of that.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.720]   And so for me, it's like, man, I'm living a charmed life.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.280]   Like there are literally hundreds of millions of people
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   on the face of this earth
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.720]   who would trade places with me in a heartbeat.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.960]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.560]   And so I try to keep that perspective.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.320]   And so that's why for me, when I show up to work,
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.200]   it's like, look, what you see is what you get.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.440]   And I'm gonna be my authentic self
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.880]   because I know me being my authentic self
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.760]   is when I bring my best version
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.200]   of the professional to work.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.240]   And that's when you're gonna get the best out of me.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.080]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.400]   - And if you want the best out of me,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.520]   then you have to support me and me being my authentic self.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.760]   If you can't do that, guess what?
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.560]   You're not gonna get the best of me.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.760]   And so, and I'm not gonna do it on purpose.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.160]   That just naturally was gonna happen.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.600]   And so for me, I realized that I have to be authentic.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.800]   And people have told me that too.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.680]   Like when they work with me or after the fact,
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.000]   they said, "Hey, I like how authentic you are
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.120]   and you don't sugarcoat things,
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.080]   but then at the same time, you're also not,
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.680]   you know, really negative about things."
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.720]   And so for me, it was key to do that
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   and recognize that not everybody has that luxury, right?
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.440]   And I don't think I've ever been hindered by that,
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.280]   to be honest with you.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.360]   I think part of it is, you know, skill set and experience
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.680]   and working with cool people like you
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.800]   and, you know, those kinds of workplaces.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.600]   But I think for me, it's super important
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.400]   for you to just be authentic and not be fake.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.600]   And especially when you get into a leadership role, right?
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.200]   Like once you're in a leadership role,
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.000]   you know that the work is different.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.680]   It's not about you and your success anymore, right?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.200]   It's about your team's success.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.280]   And that's how you are successful as a leader,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.240]   is if your team is successful, right?
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.480]   And so if you have a growth marketing manager,
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.440]   look, unless they're hitting their goals and their targets
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.080]   and they're, you know, they're excelling,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.760]   then you're not, you're failing them as a manager
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.880]   if you're not helping them realize that for themselves.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.160]   - Yeah.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.960]   - And so, and I realized that people respond
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.080]   to leaders who are authentic, who are like,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.560]   "Hey man, I care about you as a human being
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.400]   "as much as I care about you with getting the job done.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.320]   "And let me understand that about you and not be fake."
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.400]   And so I'm glad you brought that up 'cause that's another one
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.640]   of my, you know, X-Men superpowers is authenticity
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.400]   and it's carried me a long way.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.080]   And I mean, I'm gonna continue to do the same thing
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.920]   so long as I'm a professional, so.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.920]   - Yeah.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.840]   Yeah, it's kind of similar to my journey
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.760]   in that we have a personality trait
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.280]   where we're friendly and optimistic.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   I think for me, so it went through the spectrum
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.600]   where I actually started my career very much extroverted.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.760]   I was like your classic ENFP.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.360]   I'm now INTJ.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.200]   I don't know if that's because,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.840]   I don't know if it's because I'm managing people now
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.520]   and I need my own time.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.280]   I don't know what that is.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.040]   But I remember early in my career,
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.000]   I tried to be myself at work and I did,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.880]   but what it looked like was I had way too much energy
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.720]   for people.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.800]   And I'm being myself,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.000]   but I didn't necessarily have the discipline
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.680]   or know how to apply, kind of put some restraint around it.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.600]   Well, restraint is the wrong word
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.640]   'cause we're talking about being ourselves,
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.280]   but like the packaging and how people receive that
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.120]   is different, right?
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.160]   - You're optimizing.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.200]   - Yeah, optimizing.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.040]   Yeah, like now I'm at a different place now
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.520]   where I think the key that I had unlocked
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.560]   was I had to be okay with being vulnerable.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.200]   And I didn't experience how to be vulnerable
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.040]   until it hit rock bottom, right?
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.120]   I had some really difficult managers
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.080]   and things that really made me question
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.080]   my employment viability, am I worth it as an employee
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.400]   and all these kinds of things.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.480]   And I had to come out of that and figure out,
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.720]   hey, like, what is the nugget of truth in the criticism?
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.920]   And I'll just focus on that and you kind of optimize that.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.640]   And then what happened was I started getting
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.280]   more comfortable in my shoes.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.880]   And then so I reapplied it back
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.280]   to being my true self at work.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.120]   Now it's like, you know what?
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.920]   Okay, there's all of these things that I used to,
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.000]   I used to say, I'm an extrovert or whatever.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.160]   But that's actually not who I am.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.640]   It's actually, extroversion was the vehicle
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.200]   to communicate genuineness.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.840]   Okay, so like being genuine, transparent,
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.160]   that packaging can look different.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.200]   And now I'm over here.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.400]   And so it's a quieter and more thoughtful point of view.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.800]   Right, but again, I'm still bringing myself to work.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.080]   But I think that's the things
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.520]   that I would kind of tell my young self.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.680]   It's like, look, go through the time,
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.000]   take the lumps, it's gonna happen.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.320]   But if you can find a way to be yourself at work
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.920]   in the core areas that are important to you, right?
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.680]   You don't have to do everything, you know,
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.360]   but like, that's a lot less work, you know, at work.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.440]   - Yeah, no, totally, man.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.160]   And you know, man, I commend you and you inspire me, Tim,
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.040]   by, you know, what you shared,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.360]   because, you know, we cross paths in our careers
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.280]   at certain points, right?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.640]   And we were both on our journeys towards here
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.200]   and then wherever else we're gonna go.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.040]   And I intend on being your friend for a long time, Tim.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.400]   So I look forward to seeing more growth.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.240]   - Yeah.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.080]   - But I can see that, man.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.720]   Like listening to you talk now and the way that you are
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.280]   and thinking about how you were, I don't know,
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.680]   five, six years ago when we worked together.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.120]   I mean, isn't that long now?
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.160]   More, actually more like-
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.040]   - More, yeah, it's like seven years ago.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.960]   - Yeah, seven years ago, right?
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.320]   It's funny, it's great to see how you have evolved,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.200]   how we both have evolved.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.160]   And you're absolutely right, man.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.360]   Like, I think, like, I'm not surprised to see you
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   go from like an E to an I, right?
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.400]   And like, you know, for those folks who are listening,
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.640]   who are like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.480]   - The Myers-Briggs, yeah.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.520]   - The Myers-Briggs, right?
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.880]   And I said, remember my, and I agree with you.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.600]   Like, I used to be, seven years ago, 10 years ago,
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.480]   I used to be where in order for me
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.960]   to kind of recharge my batteries,
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.080]   I would need to be around other people, right?
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.200]   Let's go out for happy hour.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.040]   Let's go hang out.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.240]   Let's go do like, that's how I recharge my batteries
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.400]   after a long day.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.000]   Now, actually, as an inspiring introvert,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.200]   like I enjoy my time by myself, man.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.480]   Like, I'm good.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.360]   I'm just gonna go and like go for a walk
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.640]   or I'm just gonna go at home and just like,
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.600]   let me read a few articles and just, you know,
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.440]   get in my head.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.400]   And so, you know, I think that's a key
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.120]   that everybody needs to recognize that, you know,
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.280]   as a human being, as a professional,
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.480]   when you continue to evolve,
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.360]   or at least you should continue to evolve.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.120]   And I think one of the best tools for your evolution
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.320]   is the feedback that you get from people, right?
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.400]   Whether it be like direct them telling you something
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.800]   or like nonverbal communication,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.760]   how people respond to you physically
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.960]   when they're around you, right?
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.760]   I think feedback, feedback is a gift.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.280]   And that's one of the things that I tell my direct report
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.920]   to my mentees all the time as I give them feedback.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.960]   I say, look, like feedback is a gift.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.800]   And whether you agree with it or not,
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   that's not for me to tell you what to do about, right?
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.920]   That's for you to decide how much of the feedback
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.520]   that you're getting is noise
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.280]   and how much is it actually gonna be valuable
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.160]   and what are you gonna do with it
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.440]   to help make yourself a better human being
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.680]   and a better leader, right?
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.000]   And so, some people don't shy away from feedback
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.160]   and it might be tough to hear, but it gets better
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.000]   'cause as you get older, as you know,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.040]   tough feedback after a while, you're just like,
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.960]   yeah, I can take it, I'm a grown person.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.640]   Like, I don't, you know, but pretty much important.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.240]   - You know, it's funny.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.040]   I've talked to a lot of people in your position,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.360]   like in terms of seniority, like in our experience level,
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.920]   everyone has agreed with that exact same point,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.800]   which is being comfortable and willing to take feedback
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   as one half of the picture
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.360]   and be able to separate out the noise
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.960]   versus the truth is the other one.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.440]   And if that's one thing they could tell their younger self,
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.280]   that would be it, right?
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.960]   And so, I think for everyone who's listening to this,
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.120]   I think it's important,
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.840]   especially if you are in a role, for example,
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.360]   where you're actually creating something,
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.000]   like a creative or you're a writer,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.680]   where your performance is based
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.720]   on subjective feedback sometimes, not just objective.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.760]   And you have to find a way to, again,
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.920]   separate out that noise and come to your happy place,
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.360]   but figure out what actually is true.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.440]   And sometimes actually going back to that person
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.240]   and give you feedback
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.440]   and talking about that one nugget of truth
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.240]   and kind of blowing up and kind of not blow up,
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.080]   but like to dive into that,
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.160]   actually demonstrates a lot of maturity.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.240]   - People respect that.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.800]   People will totally.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.640]   - Yeah.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.080]   So Hector, I just want to thank you for your time.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.480]   You know, I think that the three summations
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.760]   you had at the end, which is really important.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.600]   For anyone who's watching this video and looking at,
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.480]   hey, how do I even make a pivot
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.800]   or how do I maybe reimagine my career?
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.360]   It's like, you got to take a leap of faith,
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.200]   bet on yourself, believe in yourself, right?
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.240]   Always learn, figure out how to grow.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.880]   Could be hard skill or soft skill.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.040]   There's no such thing as not learning.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.120]   And third one is look into your network
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.400]   and figure out who you can talk to
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.600]   to learn more about stuff
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.560]   and create opportunity, right?
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.400]   - Yeah.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.440]   - Well, Hector, I just want to thank you for your time.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.240]   This is really helpful for me, quite frankly,
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.080]   and hopefully for all of our viewers.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.680]   Hopefully we can come back and talk to you again.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.520]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.360]   Anytime, anytime.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.480]   For you, buddy, anything, man.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.320]   - All right, awesome.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.160]   Thanks, Hector.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.000]   - Fine, you too.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.600]   (gentle music)
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.180]   (gentle music)
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:42.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
