[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.400]   that means automatically that your life is finished, right?
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.760]   You know, you got six kids,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.600]   so you need to buckle down and live
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.160]   where you don't wanna live and, you know,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.120]   take 'em, have a big house with a big mortgage
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.240]   and work a job that you don't wanna work
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.400]   simply to support your family, right?
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.000]   Sorry, not true.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.600]   These are choices.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600]   My guest today, he and his wife have six kids
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.560]   and they're living on the road full-time,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.320]   traveling the world with their entire family.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.160]   It's pretty cool.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:20.360]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.880]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today is Wednesday, Tuesday.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.600]   Today is Tuesday, Tuesday, February 24, 2015.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.520]   (Joshua laughs)
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.440]   I don't wanna miss a day, I don't wanna get to another day.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.920]   Today is Tuesday and my guest is an awesome guy.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.760]   I think you're gonna like him.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.240]   His name is Greg Danning and he and his wife, Rachel,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   are doing exactly that.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.760]   They're living on the road with their six kids.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.040]   I've been watching Greg and Rachel's website for years now.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.920]   Their primary website is a site called
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.440]   discovershareinspire.com and it's just fascinated me.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.600]   The lifestyle they've been able to build for themselves
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.680]   and I think you're really gonna enjoy this.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   Showing how you can build a life.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.600]   That, I mean, I don't even need to go into it anymore.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.520]   You can build a lifestyle that's your choice.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.680]   It's your choice and that's what we talk about
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.780]   on this show every day.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.280]   Choose the life that you wanna live and live it
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   and there's all kinds of aspects to that
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.320]   which is what we talk about.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.880]   We talk about the technical aspects of it.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.480]   How do you actually technically accomplish it?
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.200]   How do you accomplish it in an efficient way?
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.520]   There's also the aspects of inspiration and encouragement
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.600]   and understanding how to go about things
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.840]   and understanding, frankly, that you have the permission
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.000]   to design things the way that you'd like to design them.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.960]   And one of the things that oftentimes holds people back
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.880]   is kids which is, or excuse me,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.080]   it's not an actually hold people back.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.560]   People feel like they're being held back is by their kids
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.240]   and that was one of the reasons why I wanted to bring
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.320]   Greg on the show to share this story.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.360]   Greg's an awesome guy.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   Again, he and his wife, Rachel, they have six kids,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.440]   they're living on the road.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.320]   He is one of the most enthusiastic people that I know
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.040]   and as you'll hear in the interview, it's not a front.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.800]   Don't be, he actually is this enthusiastic all the time.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.840]   But you know what?
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.960]   I'll just let him share his story with you.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.680]   Greg, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200]   I appreciate you being with me.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.320]   - Oh, I'm excited to be here.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.360]   - So dude, you are a radical kind of guy
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   and I think you wear that badge pretty proudly
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.280]   but you certainly don't fall into the norms of society
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   in just about any way, do you?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.200]   - No, I was actually thinking about that the other day.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'm like, you know, I'm pretty unconventional
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.320]   and kind of out there.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.440]   So yeah, it'll be fun.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.480]   It'll be really fun to talk about.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.520]   I think some of the things I might have to share
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.480]   might cause some thought and some,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   to see things a little differently.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   - Well good, that's what we're all about.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.720]   So kick it off.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.000]   I'd love to hear a little bit of your story
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   with how you went from wherever you started
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.800]   to living this crazy lifestyle
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.360]   with your whole family on the road full time.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.080]   - Yeah, it's actually a really great story.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   I grew up in a broken home.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   I ended up out on my own at an early age
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   and sometimes with little to eat and nowhere to stay.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.360]   And we went through some really hard years
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.040]   and so kind of fought through that.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.880]   I knew I didn't want to stay in that kind of situation
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.600]   or that kind of poverty or ignorance or anything.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.120]   I really wanted to create a great life.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.840]   You know, and you see people and you're like,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   hey man, they're living a great life.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760]   If it's doable, I can do it.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.200]   So I really went after it, you know,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.560]   and kind of set a course of, you know,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.000]   go to school, get good grades, get a degree,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.760]   get a good job, and we settled into that.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.800]   I had a great job and we, you know,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   picked up our mortgage and bought a little house
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.760]   and we're living, you know, the little American dream
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.840]   that it's kind of prescribed.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.240]   And honestly, it was really good.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.440]   We had a good life and we just kept reading and reading.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.960]   My wife and I are voracious readers and learners
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.280]   and we came across some other ideas, you know,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.720]   and some unconventional ideas.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.760]   And at first you kind of reject it like,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.000]   that's crazy, you can't do that.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   And we started to think differently
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.440]   and made some investments and did some different things
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   and kind of, you know, really felt strongly
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.040]   that we wanted to go out into developing countries
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.480]   and try to make a difference, you know.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.000]   I'd been through some tough times
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.120]   and I'd spent some time in Peru before I got married
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.840]   and thought, you know, honey, let's see if we can do this.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.200]   And so several years ago, we did, okay,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.040]   we're gonna go for it.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.480]   We're gonna quit the paycheck that comes every other week
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.040]   and we're gonna sell our house
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.840]   and we're gonna sell our stuff
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.320]   and we're gonna try to live a different lifestyle.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.360]   And it has just been one amazing adventure,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.520]   ups and downs, but it's absolutely incredible.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.440]   And so together, we have six children now.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.720]   We started out with four kids and, you know,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.760]   went and lived in Central America
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.440]   and then in the Caribbean and Dominican Republic.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.760]   Then we went to India.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.480]   Then we've driven really slow kind of overland travel
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.200]   through Alaska, the Yukon, Canada, the US, Mexico, Belize,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.680]   Guatemala and Nicaragua and now in Costa Rica again
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.520]   where we're living now.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.960]   And so it's been an absolutely wonderful journey
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.280]   and really unconventional, kind of crazy,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.560]   but for us, it's been our dream
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.360]   and it's really been a wonderful, wonderful experience.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.720]   - Why do you wanna live this kind of lifestyle?
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.600]   - You know, it kind of resonates to live deliberately
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.280]   and that's what Rachel and I like to say.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   We wanna live consciously and deliberately.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   We really resist what for us would be a humdrum existence.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.120]   And man, I wanna be really, really clear.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.560]   I don't recommend my life to anybody else.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.480]   I just, I recommend that people live their dream,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.760]   live their life, not my dream, but I say, you know,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.520]   live your dream, whatever it is, live it.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.040]   And for us, this is our dream.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.480]   We wanna see this beautiful world
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.240]   and try to have a positive difference.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.000]   We wanna have new experiences and grow and learn.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.880]   Every time we go somewhere new,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.680]   I feel like I've come back a better person.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.800]   Like I've learned something and grown.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.760]   And I just feel, I guess if I could just sum it up,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.360]   I feel alive.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.640]   I don't wanna get up and dread my life.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.400]   Dread, I don't wanna go to a job I don't like.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.640]   I don't wanna just live just to pay the bills.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.940]   I wanna live deliberately.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.520]   - How, when you originally set out and decided
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.600]   that travel was gonna play a big role
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.640]   in at least your dreams and then you were gonna try
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.440]   to build it into your lifestyle, were you rich?
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.100]   - Whew, no. (laughs)
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.580]   But you know what, I bought into the idea
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.640]   that you had to have lots of money in order to travel.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.840]   And so we had quite a bit of savings
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.000]   and I had some investments in the stock market
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.120]   and in real estate.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.600]   And so we went out initially that way
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.520]   and we were spending a lot of money
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.600]   and we had expenses back home.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.440]   And then ended up, you know,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.920]   when things kind of tightened up a little bit in 2007, 2008,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.700]   we lost almost all of our investments.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.640]   And so we had to refocus, we had to go back.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.160]   And I'm grateful it happened because it forced us
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   to question a few assumptions and a few common beliefs there
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.920]   and to revisit what's really necessary
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.040]   and what we really wanted as far as owning stuff and things
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.280]   and consumerism and what kind of lifestyle we wanted to live.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.600]   And so, I really went back to the drawing board
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.400]   and revisited that and so, no,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   you know, there's a different way to do it
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.720]   and you don't have to be rich.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.360]   To live your lifestyle, there's other ways to do it.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.600]   Being rich is great, it's wonderful.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.720]   And there's a way to do that as well
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.240]   but you don't have to be rich
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.960]   to live an unconventional lifestyle.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.480]   - What did you do differently
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.120]   after your investments declined in value?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.860]   What did you do differently from what you were doing before?
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.560]   - We became, in a way, minimalists.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.360]   (laughing)
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080]   We just thought, wait a minute, okay, you know,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.440]   if we can clear out, I don't know,
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.640]   we just kind of came to the realization
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   that everything you own or are buying
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   or everything you have in your possession
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.100]   takes up thought or time or space or attention.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.780]   You have to move it, clean it, insure it,
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.420]   take care of it, pay for it, fix it up.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.320]   I mean, everything you have.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   And so, we kind of moved to this idea of,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.360]   let's keep the stuff that really brings
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.940]   great value in our life
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.600]   and let's get rid of everything else.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.000]   And so, we're not a kind of minimalist
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.760]   like sell everything and walk around
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   in a loincloth and have nothing.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.320]   But more so of, if it doesn't add real value
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.280]   to the kind of life we want to live
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.480]   or it ends up taking away time, attention,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.880]   or resources from the kind of life we wanna live,
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   then we're better off not having it.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.480]   And so, we got rid of the stuff
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.260]   and we don't acquire much.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.020]   We try to keep it real simple but we live,
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.280]   we still live comfortably.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.400]   I still have my MacBook Pro and my iPhone 6
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.960]   and this microphone I'm talking into.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.480]   I still got things that from work
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.580]   or for passion and purpose we use.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.380]   But other than that, we try to live really simply.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.120]   - What have you learned in trying to do that with kids?
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.180]   This seems to be the challenge.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.480]   My wife and I, we have two kids.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.440]   One is 18 months old and the other is on the way
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.600]   coming this summer.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.120]   And one of the challenges is,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.820]   and I know you, how old are your kids at this point?
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.460]   - So, first of all, congratulations.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.820]   That's awesome. - Thanks.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.800]   - Oh, and man, 18 months is fun, fun, fun.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.940]   It's busy.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.860]   So, my oldest is 12 and my youngest is,
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.380]   she just turned one.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.380]   - So, you have them right in that stage
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.300]   is all the way from the one
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.820]   where there's all of the paraphernalia
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.220]   for we little ones to, I guess, just kids all along the way.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.400]   And one of the biggest challenges,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.260]   my wife and I are also aspiring minimalists.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.180]   So, we try to keep just things simple.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.700]   But man, at least in the US, kids come with a lot of stuff.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.620]   Was your secret just to move out of the US
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.260]   where kids don't come with that much stuff?
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.700]   Or what strategies do you have
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.540]   to live this kind of lifestyle with kids?
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.420]   - No, you're right.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.060]   It's kind of funny.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.580]   So, we've been back and forth.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.500]   Well, I haven't been back in the States now.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.980]   Well, I go back for visits and things.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.220]   I go to speak and go to conferences and things like that.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.860]   But living in the States,
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.460]   the last place we lived was Alaska.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.980]   And that's kind of different.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.740]   It's kind of like its own country up there,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.660]   which is really cool.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.260]   I like Alaska a lot.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.900]   But no, so I guess living in what the Alaskans
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.620]   call the lower 48, it's been a while.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.740]   And yeah, we were practicing minimalists there too.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.100]   And it was really, really funny.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.980]   The neighbors would feel sorry for us.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.740]   And they would, like literally, they'd be like,
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.100]   "Hey, do you want us to buy some things for your kids?"
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.940]   (laughing)
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.500]   And we're like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.620]   "No, you're misunderstanding.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.300]   "We're not a charity project here.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.520]   "We're doing this purposely.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.660]   "We don't have a lot of stuff."
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.220]   And yeah, it's easier abroad, I think.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.260]   But to get caught up, a lot of us get caught up,
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.700]   we get consumed by consumerism, I like to say.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.140]   And we get the stuff and the thing.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.620]   And there's always an exchange rate for that.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.500]   What we've found though, is the less we have
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   in toys and gadgets and big bags and piles
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.340]   of things for the kids, the more creative they are,
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.300]   the more time they spend with each other and outdoors,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.020]   which we're big, big advocates for spending time outdoors.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.540]   And they'll be so creative.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.540]   We'll buy them, like our little ones love to do clay
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.920]   and they'll make these amazing creations.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.020]   I mean, it's some incredible stuff.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.260]   And they spend more time painting and drawing
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.340]   and practicing musical instruments
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.340]   and building things with their hands and playing outside.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.980]   And for us, that's a lot of value.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.540]   Now, they still get on the iPad
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.140]   and they like to do their studies on there
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.460]   and some of those other things.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.540]   But we found that even if we keep it simple with them,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.620]   it makes their life more simple and more real.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.460]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.420]   And so you're more connected as a family
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.620]   and more connected to the people around you.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:17.780]   - So explain to me your trip so far.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.700]   You started in Alaska and you just drove south
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.280]   or where have you gone and where are you going
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.900]   at this point with your family?
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.180]   - Yeah.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.620]   So this was crazy.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.420]   We were in India helping people who have leprosy.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.760]   And it was just such Southern India out in the rural,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.940]   way out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.220]   It was such a special experience.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.900]   And we got pregnant with number five, Atlas.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.900]   And we debated whether to have him over in India.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.980]   It's pretty different over there.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.380]   India's pretty different.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.220]   I really love it.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.300]   It's quite different.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.740]   So we ended up, we said, you know,
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.260]   let's go back to the States somewhere
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.180]   and it just worked out to come back to have the baby.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.020]   And so we thought, where should we go?
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.900]   Well, my mother-in-law had just moved to Alaska
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.860]   and neither of us had been there.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.380]   We thought, boy, let's go to Alaska.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.100]   So our flight was into Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.800]   We got off within two days.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.860]   I'd bought a van for our family and we drove across the US
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.340]   and up the Alcan Highway up to through Canada,
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.540]   British Columbia and Alberta and the Yukon, Alaska.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.660]   Oh, it was wonderful.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.140]   - Were you heading for a job or just,
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.500]   you decided we'll go and figure it out when we get there?
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.260]   - Yeah, just figured out when we get there.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.540]   So we went up there and just, I mean,
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.580]   the goal was to experience Alaska and have a baby up there.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.940]   So we got up there, ended up spending a year,
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.860]   had a really great experience, just love Alaska.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.220]   And then we said, you know what, where do we go next?
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.340]   And we were, we were trying, you know,
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.180]   Thailand was on the radar and Columbia was on the radar.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.860]   And we thought, you know what?
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.420]   We are all the way up the top here.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.780]   And I've heard of people actually traveling
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.540]   from Alaska all the way to Argentina.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.380]   And it was a crazy idea.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.220]   I mean, it was nuts.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.600]   And we're like, come on, no way, you know?
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.540]   But it started to grow on us and we thought, you know,
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.580]   we can do it slow and just kind of move along.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.500]   And so we ended up buying a big truck.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.340]   We changed out our vehicle and it just worked out
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.740]   just right to get a vehicle that would work
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.640]   for the overlanding.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.780]   And so we pulled out of Alaska four years ago
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.100]   and just slowly started making our way South,
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.940]   you know, exploring and experiencing,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.020]   visiting with people, building incredible friendships,
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.140]   meeting wonderful people,
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.940]   and seeing things we never knew existed
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.100]   and just slowly meandered through,
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.220]   like I mentioned previously,
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.260]   through Canada and the Western United States.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.340]   Four months just meandering through Mexico
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.020]   and a month in Belize.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.220]   Ended up staying a year and a half in Guatemala
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.300]   'cause we set up a humanitarian organization
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.140]   to try to help them.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.300]   They're pretty impoverished and undernourished there.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.260]   And so that's still going.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.580]   And so we stayed there for a while
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.300]   and then a couple months on the beach in Nicaragua.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.260]   And then we've been here in Costa Rica for a year.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.660]   And that's where number six was born down here.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.460]   - And from here, are you gonna ship over,
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.740]   ship around the Darien Gap and start in South America?
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.580]   Or what's next?
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.460]   - So that was the plan.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.860]   And we still wanna do that.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.300]   So yeah, you drive into Panama,
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.500]   you go to Cologne, which is on the Caribbean side,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.740]   just another side of Panama City.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.980]   And you ship from Cologne into Cartagena, Colombia
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.580]   to get across the Darien Gap.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.660]   And we will do that and then explore
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.340]   the rest of South America.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.300]   We wanna see every country down there.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.900]   But we really, I don't know,
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.620]   it just kinda, without planning,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.660]   it just kinda popped up,
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.140]   this desire and kind of impression
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.060]   to go over to Europe and Africa.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.060]   And so we actually, this year,
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.460]   our plan is to head to, we're gonna fly into Barcelona
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.500]   and spend a few months in Spain, Portugal, and France,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.140]   and then do a few months in Morocco
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.180]   and spend some time in Africa.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.820]   And then go over and maybe see a little bit
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.380]   of Israel, Egypt, Eastern Europe.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.220]   And just kinda do that.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.340]   We don't feel like that'll be long-term,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.180]   but we just kinda go over there,
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.100]   we wanna experience that
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.180]   and get some different languages, different cultures.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.260]   I've already started learning French now.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.700]   I'm practicing that to get over there.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.420]   So just some different cultures,
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.220]   different customs, different languages,
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.420]   and then come back over
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.620]   and then finish the rest of this trip in South America.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.220]   - So it sounds pretty cool,
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.860]   for those of us who are an adventurous sort.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.100]   But how practically do you actually pay
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.500]   for your life on the road?
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.820]   Are you earning income?
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.380]   Is it all, do you have real estate in the US still?
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.740]   Or how practically do you pay for your life on the road?
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.580]   - Right.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.780]   And I know this sounds crazy.
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.140]   Some people were like, that is nuts.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.100]   And it is, I acknowledge that.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.780]   It is a crazy lifestyle.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.300]   But we'll rent a place.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.260]   So we come down, we rent a place,
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.460]   a beautiful place on the beach or in the mountains.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.300]   We enjoy the people and the culture
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.980]   and try to do some service and make things happen.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.340]   And it actually is, it's slow, it's deliberate.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.860]   We keep our family routines.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.660]   We do the same thing,
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.020]   the same things whether we're moving
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.380]   or staying in a place.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.340]   And so we live a life that, it's a great life.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.620]   It really is.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.140]   So the way we pay for it is,
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.460]   we've done several different things,
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.780]   but now I'm an educational mentor.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.100]   And so I mentor mostly youth and young adults
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.860]   in a classical based education.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.380]   And so I do, there's so many great softwares
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.780]   and so many great resources and technology
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.500]   that come along just even in the last five years
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.900]   that have made that possible.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.260]   And so I meet with, on a daily basis,
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.620]   I meet with youth and young adults
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.580]   and some adults for educational mentoring.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.980]   And that's the bulk of what we do.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.740]   We've also started a site called worldschoolacademy.com,
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.180]   which really is just, it's helping parents
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.300]   with other options.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.420]   We're so passionate about education.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.340]   And so helping whether people homeschool or unschool,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.180]   or they wanna travel or live abroad
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.380]   or whatever they wanna do, public school, private school,
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.540]   just give educational resources for families.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.740]   So that's the bulk of what we're doing.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.700]   My wife is also a web designer.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.540]   So she does some web design when she wants to.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.860]   And that's the bulk of what we're doing right now.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.420]   And I can do that wherever there's
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.180]   a decent internet connection.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.380]   - So this world, this tutoring,
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.100]   so essentially you're having Skype meetings,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.760]   kind of coaching type of things.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.260]   Parents will hire you to coach their children
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.560]   and to mentor their children.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.460]   Is that the type of thing you're talking about?
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.420]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.140]   I do teach a couple leadership courses on an academy,
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.220]   the Williamsburg Academy.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.940]   I teach a couple leadership courses there
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.020]   and really, really great stuff,
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.620]   classical based liberal arts stuff,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.300]   and just studying the great things
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.060]   and really preparing youth and young adults to lead out.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.980]   But yeah, the parents hire me to lead the educational
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.880]   and personal development pursuits
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.420]   for their young women and young men.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.240]   - Did you have that established
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.460]   before leaving on your trip?
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.100]   Or was this something that you worked out
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.220]   while you were on the road?
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.500]   - No, I came along the road, yeah.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.700]   And we've done several different things along the road
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.660]   and explored many different ideas.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.160]   And actually started a few different companies.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.540]   And we just kind of fell into this.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.860]   And this for us, one of the things I guess I gotta share
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.320]   is that we think it's so important to live purposely.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.020]   And I know people have strong feelings about that,
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.660]   but I feel like everyone has a purpose,
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.580]   a mission, maybe a gift, or like I like to call it,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.820]   everyone has a song to sing, something they can offer.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.560]   And so it's not merely about making money.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.140]   It's not merely about having an income source.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.260]   I think it's possible to earn an income, a good income,
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.780]   doing something you love to do.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.340]   And man, I'm in my spot.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.940]   I'm singing my song and I love it.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.020]   And so it's a great way to earn a good income
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.700]   and to do something you really love
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.940]   and are passionate about.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.860]   - On the road, I know you've been on the road
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.980]   for quite a while.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.260]   You must have come across lots of people
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.500]   that are on the road and earning income
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.240]   and basically just weren't willing to wait
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.000]   until they were old and rich to head out.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.840]   And I think if memory is correct,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.440]   didn't you and your wife, I think you created
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.720]   a series of videos at some point
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.760]   profiling different people and their stories.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.780]   Could you share some of the ideas
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.460]   and some of the different paths that you've come across
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.760]   of other families, how they've taken their families
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.880]   on the road and paid for it while they traveled?
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.800]   - Yeah, so I mean, we found an astoundingly
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.240]   a lot of people out doing this and living unconventionally,
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.180]   either living abroad or traveling full-time
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.080]   or even kind of nomadic, either as single people
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.040]   or couples or families.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.640]   And we were shocked to find that many.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.800]   So many of them who didn't have blogs
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.160]   were just out wandering the earth.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.640]   And everywhere we went, we started meeting
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.800]   more and more people.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.600]   And as we pulled out of Alaska with our website,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.800]   people started to contact us all along the way
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.280]   and said, "Hey, we'll meet up here."
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.560]   And, "Hey, come stay with us here."
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.440]   And, "Oh, when you get there, we'll meet up there."
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.160]   And we've built some absolutely incredible friendships
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.600]   but also started meeting all these people.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.280]   And of course I'm a very curious person.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.480]   I wanted to learn.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   So I started just asking all these great questions
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.360]   and getting these excellent stories.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.760]   I thought, you know, I gotta get this on video.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.280]   I gotta record these things and share it with people.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.120]   And so we did.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.920]   We started a series there,
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.600]   just interviewing all the travelers we met
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.360]   and the curiosity of, well,
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.680]   how are you funding this lifestyle?
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   How are you making it happen?
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.340]   And how are you building your life?
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.140]   And it was so fun and so insightful to see,
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.000]   a single guy who can live in Central America or Asia
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.100]   on as little as 500 bucks a month and live pretty well.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.120]   I mean, you could do it.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.960]   If you're a minimalist,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.440]   you can live pretty well at a few hundred bucks up to,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.240]   you know, I interviewed families
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.560]   that are making $75,000 a month.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.080]   No, $30,000 a month and several, 20, $25,000 a month.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:18.920]   And they're mobile.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.780]   They're completely mobile.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.600]   They can do their work from wherever they want.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.440]   And so they choose where they wanna live
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.560]   just because they feel like living there for a while.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.780]   And if they wanna move, they'll move.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.080]   And so it was fascinating to see
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.560]   how they built their businesses,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.420]   how they run their businesses,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.360]   how they grow their businesses
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.640]   and how they build it around their lifestyle.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.620]   And I guess that was a common thing
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.000]   that most of them chose a lifestyle
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.720]   and then built a business around that
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.900]   instead of choosing a career or having a career choose them
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.080]   and then building their life around that career.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.520]   So it was a really unconventional idea
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.280]   and pretty fascinating and powerful
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.080]   and fun to explore and understand that.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   - So obviously all of the work was being done
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.060]   through an internet connection,
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.160]   but what were the types of actual careers?
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.280]   Was it all selling get-rich-quick schemes on the internet
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.320]   or were just some of them people
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.440]   had taken more traditional roles online?
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.920]   What were the types of jobs that people were doing?
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.280]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.840]   And a lot of people kind of jump on that
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.280]   and immediately assume, oh, it's probably some blogger
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.600]   blogging about their travels
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.720]   and trying to sell something.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.160]   And what I found for the most part,
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.800]   actually, it was quite different.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.760]   Almost none of the people we interviewed did it that way.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.160]   They actually were doing things that were pretty normal
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.040]   and pretty simple.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.780]   And some of them actually were in location.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.480]   So there was a few of them that don't require internet,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.320]   but nowadays, most of it's required internet.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.840]   Let me think through a few of them.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.120]   One of them, they were wholesale.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.680]   They had set up wholesale accounts
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.160]   selling watches and jewelry.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.680]   Another one sold electronic cigarettes.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.920]   Another one, several of them actually
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.880]   have been virtual assistants
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.600]   where they do either marketing or web design
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.340]   or assistant type work for businesses and entrepreneurs.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.880]   Some of the others, one of them ran a running company,
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.140]   had a running company.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.800]   Some did some teaching.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.080]   Some did multi-level marketing things
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.200]   or sold other products.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.840]   Several of them did information products.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.060]   They would create eBooks.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.260]   Some of them were in travel, how to travel,
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.540]   how to travel with family, how to travel around the road,
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.740]   how to travel cheaply.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.120]   Man, I'm trying to think through them.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.700]   There were so many different options
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.800]   and so many different ideas.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.960]   Well, several of them were investors.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.160]   I interviewed several investors.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.520]   One did Forex trading.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.580]   One did just straight stocks.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.080]   One traded options.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.880]   Others did real estate investing or sold real estate
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.760]   in that country wherever they chose to go live.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   I mean, there's just so many different options.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.640]   That's what astounded me is you kind of roll out
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.280]   thinking there's probably only a couple ways
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   to really make money online.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.760]   And the truth is there are more and more ways every day.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   And in fact, the variety of ways to do it
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.480]   was as unique as the people who were doing it.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.080]   - Right, that's exactly kind of where I was hoping
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.560]   you would go because the trend I see is in the early,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.200]   so-called, we're still in the early days,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.600]   but a decade or so ago,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.760]   if you were gonna make money online,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.960]   it was probably gonna be something relating
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.280]   to teaching people how to make money online
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.840]   or selling an info product or something like that.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.860]   And nothing wrong with that.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.560]   That can be hugely valuable.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.960]   But I see a couple of trends.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.880]   Number one, if you have a physical job,
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.120]   many physical jobs are very much in danger
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.280]   of being outsourced.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.480]   And so you need to be careful
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.440]   of the type of physical work you have.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.640]   If you're working in a factory
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.120]   or if you're working in a warehouse or something like that,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.160]   it's only a matter of time
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.640]   until many of those jobs get outsourced.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.320]   If you're driving a truck or driving a car for a living,
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.960]   it's only a matter of time, I don't know,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.360]   a decade or two before all of those things
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.960]   will be self-driving.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.800]   But many jobs that have been traditionally done in offices
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.040]   have easily made a transition to being done
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.960]   just simply through the internet connection.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   So whether it's the type of work that I do
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.840]   with this podcast, with this show,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.240]   whether it's the type of work I do as a financial advisor,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.720]   whether it's, you know, there's just so many things
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.520]   where it's getting easier and easier.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.600]   And so I think more and more jobs or businesses
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.900]   that people are already engaged in
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.400]   can simply be moved virtually.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.020]   And you might have to shuffle some clients around.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.540]   You might have to fire a few and get a few new ones
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.200]   that are willing to work with you in that way.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.120]   But there are so many options open to people at this point
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.780]   that never existed before,
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.620]   where simply location is not that big a deal.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.620]   And so you can, the world is truly open to you.
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.080]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.160]   I'm so glad you brought that up
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.880]   because it's critical that people understand that.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.240]   And in fact, you kind of sparked the memory
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.200]   of several people we interviewed who actually,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.040]   you know, they asked their employer,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.780]   "Hey, could I work remotely?"
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.980]   And in many cases, reporters are like,
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.000]   "Well, let's give it a try."
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.200]   And it worked.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.800]   And then there's big, big organizations
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.560]   that have huge calling centers.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.480]   They're just saying, "You know what?
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.440]   "Let's figure out how we can get people
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.120]   "to answer the phones at home."
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.680]   And so they're getting rid of these huge office building
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.560]   and they're getting rid of all the overhead
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.380]   and the commute time and all these other obstacles.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.520]   And they're moving things to, yeah, to the digital life.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.960]   So you can do it from home
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.080]   or you can do it wherever you are in the world.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.200]   And it's changing.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.760]   You know, and I love to think about that whole idea.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.280]   You know, five years from now,
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.440]   there's gonna be something that we depend on
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.400]   that doesn't even exist today.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.480]   And we're gonna be, you know,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.280]   using things that don't exist
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.080]   that we're gonna say, "We gotta have that."
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.480]   I mean, new technologies are gonna come out
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.960]   and they're gonna offer so many more jobs
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.360]   and so many more opportunities,
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.280]   but people have got to be willing to change
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.000]   and explore new ideas and stay current with things
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.680]   and with their own growth and their own skills
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.480]   and abilities and their knowledge.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.360]   I mean, think about how movie rental stores
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.400]   seemed like such a solid investment.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.240]   Like, you know, people will always watch a movie.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.440]   Let's open a movie rental store.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.600]   They're gone.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.960]   They're gone.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.400]   It went from video cassettes to DVDs
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.920]   to now you just, you click a button on your computer
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.320]   and you can rent a movie.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.000]   And it's just fascinating.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.640]   So you gotta be able to change and adapt
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.320]   to these exciting times we live in.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.960]   - You tried a few different things,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.920]   and you've tried many things,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.800]   and I'm sure you'll try more
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.040]   before you've found what's currently effective for you,
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.240]   which is this online tutoring and mentoring, right?
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.080]   - Right.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.760]   So I just wanted to make that point
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.840]   because that's also something I've seen and heard,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.160]   or I just have observed.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.240]   There's a very uncomfortable,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.360]   the transition that's happening in our society
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.840]   is very uncomfortable.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.080]   So some businesses, I think it was a year ago
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.920]   that Yahoo was famous for kind of revoking
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.280]   a lot of their work from home stuff
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   and saying we've got to come back in the office.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.240]   And so some things are working, some things aren't working.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.320]   Some jobs and businesses, people are finding,
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.400]   no, I really do need this in-person interaction.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.680]   And some people are finding, no, I really don't.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.720]   So I would just say if you're gonna pursue
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.240]   this type of alternative lifestyle,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.620]   be flexible and be willing to work at things
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.600]   and adapt and change and don't feel like
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.120]   if you do something and it doesn't work,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.240]   that's the end of your life.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.800]   You can find a way to make,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.080]   you can find a way to press through
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.640]   and assure the dream
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.760]   if you're willing to keep working at it.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.520]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.320]   And it's almost essential, I would say.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.720]   In fact, I'd be bold enough to say
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.640]   that you kind of have to fail a couple times.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.480]   You have to fail forward, you have to try stuff.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.040]   Like I mentioned, I'm a voracious reader.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.320]   I read biographies, autobiographies, and studies.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   And so many of the very successful people
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.600]   we look at and admire had failures, even bankruptcies.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.120]   I know several multimillionaires who said,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.560]   yeah, two or three bankruptcies,
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.080]   kind of the norm before you really get going
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.040]   and get humming.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.720]   And they fail forward, they try things that don't work out.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.080]   And a lot of people we interviewed said,
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.360]   yeah, we tried this, we tried that, it didn't work,
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.080]   but we learned so many great lessons.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.440]   And because of those lessons,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.520]   we were able to start it up again and really make it happen.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.480]   So there's almost this failing forward process
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.240]   that I think you try things
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.120]   and don't throw in the towel, don't give up.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.040]   And like you were saying, be very flexible
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.320]   and be able to move with what's happening
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.800]   in the current demographics and in society.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.000]   - Greg, what makes people willing to fail?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.600]   - A vision.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.160]   And I think where people lack a vision,
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.960]   they're afraid of failure and be willing to quit.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.240]   Either one, not to try at all, or two, to give up,
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.680]   but you've got to have a clear vision
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   of where you're going and what you want.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.280]   'Cause failing's not easy, and man, is it uncomfortable.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   And it's brutal, but you have to be willing to fail,
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.520]   learn from your failures and get up,
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.240]   dust yourself off and do it again.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.400]   And I think one of the main things,
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.040]   you've got to have a vision of where you're going
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.360]   or else you just can't stick through it.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.880]   - Reason I say it's interesting because to me,
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.080]   in my work, both in my own personal life
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.240]   and then in my work with financial planning clients,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.760]   I think this is one of the areas
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.480]   where we could use some enhancements
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.840]   on I guess the literature that's available.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.800]   'Cause what I was always frustrated, I read a lot as well,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.880]   and one of the things that always frustrated me
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.720]   was reading about people talking about,
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.600]   oh, failure is gonna be valuable for you.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.120]   And to be fair, very few authors say that failure is fun.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.000]   It's certainly not fun.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.080]   Most people acknowledge that it's not fun.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.720]   But many times, people, authors or things that you read,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.520]   they kind of just gloss over,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.000]   I guess the reasons why you would be willing
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.960]   to accept failure.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.200]   And I know for me, I've watched so many people
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.080]   where I look at their situation,
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.360]   I say, look, it's simple, just do this, this, this, this.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.400]   And no, I can't guarantee it's gonna work,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.880]   but it's probably gonna work.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.560]   But then I look at my own personal journey
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   and I closed my financial planning practice
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.440]   to start Radical Personal Finance.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.320]   And there was zero chance of, excuse me,
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.000]   there's zero assurance of success.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.440]   In fact, it's probably the most difficult,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.480]   risky business venture that I could imagine doing.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.680]   But I just came to the point where I didn't,
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.480]   I was more, I'm more, I still am.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.800]   I'm more willing to just simply accept failure.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.440]   I'm more willing to sell my house.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.400]   I'm more willing to go into debt.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.080]   I'm more willing to, shoot, if I wind up bankrupt,
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.480]   whatever, I'll deal with it.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.080]   And I just got to the point where I just didn't really care,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.040]   meaning I do care.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.240]   I'm not, my word is good.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.220]   It's very important to me to do things well.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.920]   But I got to the point where I feared not trying
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.800]   and regretting something more than I feared
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   trying something and failing at it.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.360]   And it's hard to articulate that
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.520]   because it's a very transformative experience.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.760]   But it's something I think a lot about
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.920]   and try to help, how to help people,
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.040]   not pursue something that's not gonna work,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.800]   but be willing to have something that you want,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.280]   that you're willing to pursue enough
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.600]   so that even if it doesn't work,
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.560]   you're still satisfied with your choice to pursue it.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.960]   - Yes, amen, amen.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.320]   To be able to kind of put it on the line
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.200]   in order to live a better story,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.760]   to take the risk to, well, like I mentioned,
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   it being to live deliberately,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.400]   to step out there and make it happen.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.040]   Yeah, oh, it's what I call the exchange rate.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.720]   What are you willing to exchange your life and time for?
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.280]   And are you willing to take those risks
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.960]   in order to build something great,
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.920]   in order to build a life that you absolutely love?
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.700]   And part of that is that, well, I guess my favorite saying
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.120]   is that failure is fertilizer.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.360]   (laughing)
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.100]   And it stinks, but man, it's good.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.200]   It gets the work done.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.680]   And I love your story.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.120]   That's a great story where you just,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.720]   you gotta put it on the line and face the consequences
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.000]   or the potential consequences
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.480]   and say, I'll deal with that if it comes,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.560]   but I'm willing to put it on the line here
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.280]   and to get, like Theodore Roosevelt says,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.960]   to get in the arena and get dirty
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.280]   and maybe a little bloody,
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.840]   but to get in there and not be with those timid souls
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.720]   who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.640]   - Love that quote.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.600]   And again, it's not that good planning isn't important.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.840]   You know, I certainly, I don't,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.440]   I have zero intention of winding up bankrupt.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.120]   I acknowledge that it's a theoretical possibility,
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.720]   but good planning can avoid that for the most part.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.080]   And so I have zero intention
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.000]   of ever winding up in that place.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.040]   I guess the point is you get to a scenario,
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.760]   you get to a place in life where you just realize,
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.600]   no matter what, this is something that needs to be pursued.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.520]   And I think there's a real joy in the work.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.720]   There's a real joy in the struggle
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   that we don't often discuss in our society.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.520]   It seems as though in our modern era,
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.960]   we look to pleasure as a source of happiness.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.200]   And we assume that if life is easy
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.360]   and if life is pleasurable,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.040]   then that's gonna be what's truly joyful.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.400]   But the reality is there's a great joy in victory.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.240]   And my proof for that is look at all the people
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.640]   that wake up at five in the morning
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.100]   and go out and run every day.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.960]   Look at all the people who sign up for an extreme sport
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.480]   or who sign up for a triathlon.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.760]   Look at all the people who are looking desperately
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.040]   for this sense of accomplishment
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.280]   that comes through doing something that's difficult.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.720]   And I would never tell someone where they should
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.800]   or shouldn't find it,
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.720]   but you can find it in running a triathlon,
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.040]   and you can also find it in building a business.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.840]   You can find it in traveling in a different country
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.160]   where it's a little bit more difficult
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.780]   to travel comfortably.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.080]   And there's a real joy that I find, at least,
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.480]   being out there and working hard at something
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.360]   that's difficult because you get that sense
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.960]   of accomplishment, which it's easy not to get
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.400]   in modern Western society.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.160]   - Oh, man, I love that.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.760]   It really resonates with me.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.480]   And not even, the accomplishment's amazing,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.200]   but some of us thrive on the challenge
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.000]   and the difficulty and the struggle.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.080]   And I think that's what you mean by the accomplishment.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.200]   Like you did something really hard.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.240]   And I did triathlons for years,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.840]   and so I'm sitting here, you're naming these things,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.760]   and I'm like, oh, yeah, those were brutal.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.880]   And I get up every day at 4 a.m.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.000]   So I can study and exercise, and I love pushing myself.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.740]   And you're right.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.720]   So I gotta share this 'cause it just changed,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.520]   it changed my whole reality.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.200]   It's a phrase called bread and circuses in Latin.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.120]   I'm gonna kill the Latin, but it's panum et circensis
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.880]   is what it is, the bread and circuses.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.320]   And what it did, it brought about the fall of Rome.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.040]   And it was the idea that came in,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.880]   these politicians came in, and they wanted to win the votes.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.240]   And the idea was, look, if I give,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.200]   if we get the people to have food and entertainment,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.720]   so bread and circuses, right,
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.840]   if we give 'em food, cheap food and cheap entertainment,
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.280]   right, then they'll have the, we give 'em,
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.960]   I'm quoting here, "The satisfaction
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.240]   "of the immediate shallow requirements of the populace."
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.600]   And so you just kinda get 'em to settle in and be content.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.940]   It's a means of appeasement, public approval.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.720]   And it just kinda sets it open.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   So a lot of us, we settle in and we're like,
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.800]   well, no, let's find something that's easy and comfortable.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   Right, we love ease and comfort, we love entertainment.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.880]   And I think sometimes we can really miss out
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.680]   on the great parts of life if what we often seek
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.920]   is food, cheap food and cheap entertainment.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.520]   And that brought down, Juvenile said
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.640]   this brought down the fall of Rome.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.000]   It was that movement toward just,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.880]   if we got food and we have entertainment, we're good to go.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.280]   But I think you're absolutely right,
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.000]   that we can push ourselves and be wise and plan
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.880]   and prepare, you don't have to be crazy.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.840]   But to be willing at some point, you say,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.480]   okay, it's never gonna be a perfect time.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.440]   You gotta just take a step into the darkness and go for it.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   - How do you keep your energy high?
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.920]   And what I mean is that you are an extremely energetic
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.960]   and effusive person.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.760]   And if I weren't familiar with your work,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.880]   I would think in many ways that it was a front.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.920]   But having seen your work over the years,
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.960]   I'm convinced that it's actually probably
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.000]   how you express yourself on a daily basis.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.800]   How do you keep your energy so high?
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.760]   - That's funny, Josh, you bring that up.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.000]   It's true, a lot of people are like,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.160]   man, are you being fake?
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.480]   Are you putting, is this your microphone voice,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.600]   your camera face or whatever?
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.440]   But this is how I live.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.680]   I just, I'm a really excited and excitable guy
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.320]   and I live with high energy.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.080]   Some of my friends call me the,
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   it's like I'm a walking anti-depressant.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.600]   (laughing)
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.640]   I just love life.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.120]   And like I mentioned at the beginning,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.960]   I came from a dark place, man.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.720]   And those were some hard years
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.600]   where I had no friends around, no family,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.960]   just some real struggles in some tough areas.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.000]   And I thought, life doesn't have to be like this.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.920]   Life can be great.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.120]   And I live with a deep sense of gratitude.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.360]   For me, my alarm clock is an opportunity clock, sincerely.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.600]   I mean, I'm grateful to be alive
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.480]   and to count those blessings,
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.400]   to have my health and a family
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.200]   and be able to live and do things that I love to do
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.920]   and make a difference in the world, to live on purpose.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.200]   So how do I maintain the energy?
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.480]   I view myself as a holistic person, as a whole person.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.720]   And it's spiritually, emotionally,
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.640]   mentally, physically, and socially.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.080]   It's balancing those things,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.320]   giving each of them not equal attention,
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.480]   but appropriate attention,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.880]   as much as each of them needs to be healthy and well.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.320]   But too many of us get, we get burned out
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.160]   one way or the other.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   Maybe we don't have the physical health
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.840]   or the emotional strength or relationships are hurting
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.920]   or we neglected the spiritual side of ourselves.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.240]   And so if we keep all those in an appropriate balance
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.160]   and we spend time each day
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.400]   working on our highest priorities,
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.080]   I eat very, very well.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.400]   I exercise vigorously every day.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.760]   I spend time in meditation and prayer,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.280]   work on emotional mastery and greatness and relationships.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.480]   Man, it just makes for an absolutely fantastic life.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.840]   And it's not a front.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.520]   And I'm glad you have that experience with me
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.840]   to go know if to have time that this is consistently
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.320]   who I am and who I try to be.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.920]   And I really am excited and happy.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.760]   And I sincerely love life.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.600]   It's not a show.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.680]   I just, I'm like this.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.640]   My kids will tell you that.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.480]   My wife will tell you that.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.000]   My friends will tell you that.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.320]   But it's, for me, it's a great way to live.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.600]   I really live with enthusiasm.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.000]   And I just wanna be happy all the time
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.360]   and really, really not miss out on a fun day of life.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.600]   - What were the catalysts in your early life?
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.400]   You said twice now that you said you came
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.680]   from a really a tough starting place.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.480]   What were the catalysts in your early life
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.040]   that kind of made a real difference
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.160]   in the direction of your life?
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.000]   Were there people?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.640]   Was there influences?
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.120]   Was there books?
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.160]   What made a real difference in your life
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.480]   in those early years?
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.520]   - Oh man, that's such a great question.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.480]   There was, I was reading great books.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.160]   I realized that life didn't have to be that way.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.560]   At some point, I don't even know
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.560]   if I would have cognitively have stated it this way,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.280]   but at some point I kind of came to the realization
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.000]   that life is exactly what you make of it.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.880]   And if other people were living happy, successful lives,
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.520]   then I could too.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.920]   And I came to the realization
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.880]   that nothing will get better until I do.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.240]   And that's just a great truth there,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.840]   that nothing gets better until you do.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   And then everything gets better as you do.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.520]   And that I wasn't a victim.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   And so along the way, there were, yes, of course,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.200]   there were great people who reached out
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.320]   and helped and mentored, led me.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.600]   And then great books that started to shift my reality.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   And I just came to this clear idea that I was accountable.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.880]   Yes, people had done things to me.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.600]   Yes, my parents had made mistakes.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.240]   And yes, I'd been wronged.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.640]   And that was my past.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   But living in the past wasn't gonna help me.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.120]   And I came to this day where I just realized,
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.960]   you know what, I am accountable from this point on,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.720]   I am accountable for how my life turns out
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.800]   and I better make it awesome.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.640]   Why not?
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.880]   You know, if I get to choose, then choose awesome.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.600]   And so I just said, I'm gonna go after it vigorously.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.360]   That was 20 years ago.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.800]   And I have been studying voraciously
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.280]   in personal development and history and great classics
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.320]   and the best books and the great questions
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.040]   and really pushing after personal development
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.680]   and trying to make the most of myself.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.200]   And I believe, I guess I would say
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.900]   that the greatest tragedy in the world
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.760]   is when a person, you or I,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.960]   does not reach their full potential.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.720]   And so I go after it vigorously,
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.400]   trying to be my very best self.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.000]   And when we take full responsibility for our lives
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and we make a clear plan to build life
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.720]   as we wanna live it, then there's a path and there's a way.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.760]   And it's awesome.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.720]   It's not all roses and not all fun.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.480]   There's always challenges and obstacles.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.960]   But man, life is great.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.880]   - When you and your wife originally had the idea
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.440]   to start traveling, was one of you really the champion
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.480]   of that idea and had to get the other person on board
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.720]   or did you come to it together?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.720]   - Fortunately, because we both read so much, it was easy.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.600]   It wasn't one of us convincing the other.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.160]   We both had come across all these different books.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.520]   We'd say, hey, this great book, why don't you read it?
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.360]   And we'd read it and go, oh, hey, that's a great idea.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.760]   And we kinda discussed these ideas.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.040]   And so luckily, really from the time we were married,
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.480]   we've grown together in our vision.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.760]   And fortunately, we both felt strongly about this
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.280]   and we've read the same books and had the same discussions
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.640]   and really same experiences and come
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.280]   to similar conclusions at least.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   We don't agree on everything,
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.300]   but we really came to these conclusions like,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.480]   yeah, there's a different way to live.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.040]   There's an unconventional way to live.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.080]   And at least for our family,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.920]   we wanna grow up with a global perspective
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.280]   and get out and see this beautiful world
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.680]   and make a difference while we're doing it.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.400]   So it's just been a really great blessing
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.160]   that most of those things we've seen eye to eye
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.760]   have been able to move together.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.640]   And man, it's so much better
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.160]   when you can move together like that.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.480]   - Absolutely.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.340]   A couple of final questions here.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:08.340]   And I wanna probe just a little bit with regard to,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:13.280]   let's start with just some of the, let's start with this.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.960]   What is the biggest challenge
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.840]   or a few of the biggest challenges?
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.200]   And I understand that it's great and it's exciting
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.320]   and it's really wonderful,
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.440]   but every lifestyle that we choose
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.600]   certainly has things that are difficult.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.480]   What are the biggest difficulties and challenges
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.280]   of the lifestyle that you've chosen?
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:36.320]   - So I guess I would have to say conveniences is what it is.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.180]   Especially if people are interested in traveling
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.920]   or living abroad long-term or kind of traveling long-term.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.260]   And I guess that's kind of our lifestyle.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.160]   In each place, it's very different.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.560]   And if you go in with certain expectations
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.000]   or you want every place to be,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.260]   say, for example, you want every place
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.480]   to be like the United States.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.080]   Well, you know, you say, hey, well, back in the States,
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.820]   we do it like this, we do it like that.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.960]   But you can drive yourself crazy going, ah,
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.800]   always comparing to how it is somewhere else.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.760]   And I think there's just inconveniences.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.920]   And my wife and I were talking about that last night.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.560]   So, you know, it's just, it's absolutely worth it for us.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.700]   And for some people it's not worth it,
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.560]   but for us it's worth some of the inconveniences
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.040]   with different visas
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.380]   or the inability to get different products.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.480]   You know, in some of the countries,
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.660]   it's really hard to find the things you're after.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.280]   Whether it be books or certain appliances
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.840]   or getting your computer repaired or something.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.360]   There's some of those things that just come with travel
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.500]   that are some of the inconveniences,
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.520]   but too big of an exchange rate to be inconvenienced.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.580]   But I would say for us personally, I would say that's it.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.860]   We clearly, the school or what we call world school,
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.220]   our children, and so the schools hasn't been a big issue,
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.200]   but it is for some.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.220]   But yeah, you know, and you're away from family
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.800]   and there's a lot of, you get a lot of criticism
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.440]   for living unconventionally.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.680]   And that you have to be able to handle some of that too
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.520]   as it comes in.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:01.200]   - Are you concerned about your children and your family
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.960]   not feeling a sense of community as they get older?
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.960]   - Oh, really great question.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.540]   And we are very passionate about that
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.200]   and very intentional about that.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   We want to raise leaders who have great social skills
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.400]   and a great education and are willing to
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.080]   and able to communicate effectively and relate
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   to both young and old and rich and poor
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.760]   and black and white and everything in between
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.920]   and every race and religion and to really connect.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.600]   And it's been fun as a family to connect
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.960]   in the communities where we've had.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.520]   So we don't have an in-person really long-term connection,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.180]   like we don't spend 10 years in one place,
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:53.180]   but we've connected deeply with a lot of people
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.880]   in a lot of places.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.360]   And literally it's been fun.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   We have friends all over this world
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.400]   and our children have friends all over the world.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.980]   And it's just a great experience.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.240]   And now technology is so good that we can do video,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.760]   video conferencing constantly with family and friends
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.600]   all over the place.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.840]   And so, no, I'm not concerned about that lack of community
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.360]   because wherever we are, we dig in and we connect.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.060]   And when we stay connected to our close friends
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:23.320]   and where travel has become inexpensive and easy,
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.140]   we're constantly all over the place and connecting.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.700]   So, no, I'm not concerned about that with them.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.640]   - If you were gonna pick a day and not the ideal day
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.080]   that if you were gonna write a blog post
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.960]   about the ideal day to tell people why travel is so great,
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.500]   but an actual day, I'm interested to know what,
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.640]   for you as a father with six active children
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.900]   and your wife and you both have a lot of responsibility
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.860]   and you're trying to earn an income and manage your children
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.940]   and learn where to go to get the type of shampoo
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.260]   that doesn't make your hair flake
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.360]   and all of that kind of stuff.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:03.380]   What does an actual day look like for you
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.580]   as far as how you run your schedule at this point
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.620]   with your family and your online work
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.520]   and all of your responsibilities?
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.740]   - Yeah, awesome, awesome question.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.580]   And you have to be pretty intense about it.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.180]   If you wanna stay prioritized,
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.060]   you have to stick to your things
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.940]   because there's so many distractions.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.680]   And that's true whether you move or you stay in one place.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.860]   There's always the laundry, the dishes,
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.340]   the people calling here, the little urgencies,
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.180]   the fires to put out.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.780]   You have to be intense about
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.420]   reaching your biggest priorities each day.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.540]   So, like I mentioned, I wake up really early,
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.700]   usually around four, and I spend time doing meditation
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.080]   and planning goals.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.500]   I read scripture and I read great books.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.980]   I do all my studying and just kind of my personal priorities
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.420]   and I get some exercise in.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.460]   That's what we do first thing in the morning.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.300]   And then we have a morning devotional that we do.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.140]   And we always stick to it where we sit down as a family.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.060]   We have all our meals together as a family.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.740]   But in the morning, we do our studying,
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.100]   we do our memorizing as a family,
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.900]   we memorize great things.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.300]   And then they jump right into the education.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.280]   And that's where I'll go do my mentoring and my work,
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.140]   and my wife will spend time then
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.900]   the first few hours of the day
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.700]   helping each kid get their education
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.580]   and work on each of their subjects
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.700]   and kind of dig into that.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.660]   And then we always try to,
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.020]   and they'll do that for several hours.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.700]   And then they get their playtime, their adventure time,
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.940]   they get out and run around in the rainforest here
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.860]   and play and have a good time.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.060]   And we always like to do,
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.580]   we always like to do some kind of adventure,
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.420]   either to go for a run or a hike or run down to the beach.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.760]   I like to go down early in the morning.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.980]   Sometimes I'll go down and surf with my sons
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.880]   just a couple of weeks ago, we were surfing
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.020]   and these baby sea turtles swam past us.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.700]   We grabbed one and played with her for a minute.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.140]   It was just, it was epic, man.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.980]   It was awesome.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.800]   Watch the sunrise,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.180]   play with a little sea turtle on the surfboard there
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.020]   with my son who's 10.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.900]   And have those bonding experiences,
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.740]   it was a great experience together.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.820]   We'll go jump in a waterfall down here
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.620]   or just go do something fun or we'll go surf.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.660]   And this isn't every day,
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.460]   but we try to throw this in where we go out
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.740]   and serve someone who's in need, go visit someone.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.920]   And then every night before bed,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.860]   I read to the kids.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.220]   And so that's kind of these rituals we stick to
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.060]   and then they change.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.260]   You gotta run to town for the,
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.780]   get the groceries in the open markets here.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.220]   You gotta go down and visit with some friends or something.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.740]   But for the most part, that's usually how the day goes.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.460]   - Do you restrict your work to those hours in the morning
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.060]   in which your kids are studying?
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.220]   - Yes.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:36.100]   For the most part, my schedule is usually from like
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:40.600]   eight to two, eight to three.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.800]   Now I do a ton of reading.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.400]   And so I'll, in the morning or in the afternoons,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.200]   late afternoons, I'll sit down and do some reading
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.800]   or some studying or prep work, which is part of my work.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.440]   But I count on being interrupted.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.080]   Little baby needs to be held
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.000]   or a little boy wants to show me something he's working on
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.100]   or my daughter wants to do something,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.040]   go share me, show me something or have a little venture.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.200]   And so I plan on being interrupted,
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.420]   but I spend some time and I'm with them.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.340]   And I guess that's cool.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.980]   That's kind of lifestyle we've kind of designed
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:13.460]   that I'm here and I can be sitting there doing some reading
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.560]   or some studying or prep work,
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.900]   but I'm right here and I can be interrupted.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.540]   - Why, is it a big deal to you that you and your wife
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.860]   are involved with your kids' educations?
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.140]   Is it just circumstantial because that's the way
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.060]   you have to do it if you want to travel?
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.340]   Or was that important to you even if you weren't traveling?
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.260]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.800]   Right after we got married,
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.480]   we decided that's the way it'd be.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.560]   That's not something we wanted to outsource completely.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.960]   Now, obviously there's tons of resources
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.400]   and we like hiring tutors to come in
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.560]   and help with specialties that we may not cover as well.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.040]   Or often, sometimes your child respond better
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.480]   to a third party than to you.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.120]   But we want to be hands-on with our kids' education
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.920]   because it's so important to us that they get
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.920]   literally a world-class education and a leadership education.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.940]   And so we are hands-on to that and always involved
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:05.780]   and always will be.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.660]   That's important to us and has been from the beginning.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.780]   So if we were back in the States just living out
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.180]   the life that we were doing before,
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.340]   we'd still do the same thing.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.900]   - Practically, there in Costa Rica,
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.420]   how practically are your kids studying right now?
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.180]   Do you have a bunch of books
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.660]   and they're working their way through books?
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.440]   Are they all sharing one computer?
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.900]   Do you have six iPads floating around the living room?
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.500]   How do you practically do it?
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.640]   (laughing)
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:32.920]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.760]   And it's funny.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.480]   We pack hundreds of books all over the world.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.320]   I feel like a pack mule sometimes moving the books.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.360]   But we feel it's important to have books in hand.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.880]   And yes, we have lots of digital books
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.960]   and lots of audio books.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.160]   We use all three media there,
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.820]   but we definitely are using paper books,
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.120]   have lots of them, we pack them all over.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.120]   So, and ours is a classical-based curriculum,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.920]   I guess you could call it.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.420]   So a lot of great books,
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.400]   the best books that have been written throughout time.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.240]   We also do have the iPad, the iPhone,
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.840]   couple computers, a couple Kindle Fires.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.460]   And so the kids will do like Khan Academy,
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.500]   excellent resource.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.680]   They do Duolingo,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.720]   which is also a phenomenal resource for languages.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.180]   They'll get on, they'll do math games.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:25.840]   And we do a lot of researching for the sciences,
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.400]   the arts.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.380]   I kind of think like there isn't anything
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.560]   you can't do with YouTube.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.040]   You can learn almost anything.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.440]   It's really great.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.200]   And then, we can do some tutoring
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.080]   and meet up with other people.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.600]   You can do a Skype session or something
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.260]   with someone who's got a gift.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.760]   You can even take music lessons online or other resources.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.600]   So it really is, it's such an exciting time to be alive
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.800]   because with some books in hand
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.460]   and access to the internet and a computer and iPad,
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.560]   you can really get access to just about
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.760]   anything you need to for a great education.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.580]   - So my final question is this.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:06.380]   I'm a big fan of travel and at this stage in my life
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.620]   and with my family, we've decided it's not something
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.980]   that we're pursuing at this stage,
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:12.960]   but it may in the future.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.620]   We'll see how time works out.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.660]   But one of the things I think is most valuable
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.300]   about travel that many people don't talk about
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.560]   is everyone focuses on perhaps,
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.660]   many people focus on the romance of travel,
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.280]   the idea of doing something different.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.060]   But I think there are some lessons from travel
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.580]   that could be applied when you're living in one space.
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:39.580]   So I'm curious to know, if I put a situation in your life,
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.060]   let's say that you had ailing parents,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.320]   either you or your wife or a relative
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.680]   that you needed to be close to and you were gonna be in
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.540]   and I were gonna bring you back to the United States
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.420]   and put you in a place that you were familiar with
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.500]   and you were gonna be there for a few years.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.900]   I'm interested to know, after all your years on the road,
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.540]   how would you structure your days?
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.140]   How would you structure your life?
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   And what lessons would you apply to that more common,
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:10.680]   so to speak, type of life, more conventional looking life?
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.620]   What lessons would you apply to that type of lifestyle
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.900]   that you've learned from your time on the road?
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.260]   - Woo, man, that's a really great question.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.180]   That's well thought out.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.380]   I like that a lot.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:24.620]   My initial reaction to that would be like, no!
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:25.860]   I can't do it.
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.340]   Except for what's called adult ADD,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.100]   adventure deficit disorder.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.420]   (laughing)
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.340]   - Like it.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.580]   - I gotta get out and play.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.020]   So no, but I've thought about that often
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.440]   and I have a lot of friends and people who contact us
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.740]   constantly on our websites and say,
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.740]   you know what, we're not gonna get out.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.660]   How do we, yeah, basically what your question is,
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.140]   what do you apply all these things you've learned,
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.380]   how do you make it happen?
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.620]   And here's what I would do
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.140]   as I've thought through that often.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.460]   I've literally thought about that question often.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:57.380]   I think we all need novelty, new experiences.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:02.100]   And actually, you can study this physiologically.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.780]   There's neural connections that happen with novelty
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.180]   and there's actually dopamine and serotonin
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.140]   and endorphins that get released into your body
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.740]   as you're having new experiences.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.100]   And I think one of the things we miss out
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.180]   if we're staying in one place
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.580]   is we don't create enough new experiences.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.740]   We get comfortable with one thing
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.180]   and we kind of settle in,
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.860]   sometimes mentally, emotionally, socially, physically,
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.900]   we just kind of settle in and we stay.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.940]   And that doesn't have to be the case
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.680]   even if you live in the same place.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.940]   You can go to new restaurants,
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.840]   you can run at different places,
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.340]   you can go out and meet new people,
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.160]   you can have new experiences.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.860]   And I would just say you'd have to be,
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:41.940]   and I especially would have to be very deliberate
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:45.700]   about having adventures and challenges.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.740]   I would be signed up for all kinds of different races.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.340]   I'd sign up for a decathlon or something,
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:53.120]   just something to challenge me in all kinds of levels.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.200]   I would get involved in community projects
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.560]   or organizations or groups
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.320]   that were challenging me mentally and socially.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.820]   And I would be planning, I'd be very, very strategic.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.580]   I'd plan out a year and do one small adventure a week,
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.700]   one pretty great adventure a month,
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.880]   and one epic adventure every quarter
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.260]   to make sure that I personally am feeling alive
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.860]   and getting out and connecting.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:22.780]   And I would be intense about learning another language
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.540]   and practicing it with anyone I can find,
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.940]   taking new classes, and especially in the States
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.260]   because we miss that down here.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.300]   I'd be spending a lot of time at the library.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.420]   - Right, right.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.260]   Yeah, I think it's,
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.980]   and that's why I wanted to wrap up on one of those places
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.180]   because oftentimes,
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:41.020]   that's why I wanted to wrap up with that question.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:44.540]   Oftentimes we romanticize another person's life.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.660]   We romanticize another person's experiences.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.500]   And I think each of us hopefully
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.700]   should just be focused on living the life
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.400]   that is right for us.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.860]   But I'll tell you,
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.460]   one of the, for me, I've been blessed at a young age,
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.540]   and I'm almost 30,
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:02.300]   and I've been blessed to be able to visit a lot of places
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.100]   and do a good amount of travel.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.260]   And I'd like to do it,
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.400]   I'd like to do more in the future,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.980]   but for me, some of the most transformative experiences
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.980]   of my life have occurred because of the travel.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.620]   And it wasn't necessarily the travel of itself,
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.060]   but rather it was the change of mindset.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.540]   So whether it's my ability to feel content
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.500]   with my standard of living,
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.340]   I'll tell you, for our honeymoon,
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.700]   my wife and I, we went to the Dominican Republic
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.860]   and then to Haiti.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.780]   And every time we travel in a place like that,
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:35.060]   we spent several days in Haiti,
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.480]   and you spend time in a place like that,
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.260]   you come back home and we started off our life
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:44.660]   in a little 200, I think it was 234 square foot
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.820]   studio apartment after we were married.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.180]   But we had just come back from Haiti
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.500]   and that apartment was beautiful.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.340]   And I had friends that would say to me,
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.100]   like, "How on earth can you live in this place?"
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.020]   And I'd just say, "Listen, what on earth more do I need?
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.460]   I have a bed, I have a chair, I have a table,
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.100]   we have a kitchen and have a bathroom and a closet,
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.020]   a place for our clothes.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.500]   We're two people, why do we need anything more?
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.020]   Why should I spend to fulfill this external expectation
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.900]   of the US American culture?
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.260]   After all, I'm thankful.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.540]   You don't know where I just was.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.460]   I'm thankful to be in this situation.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.740]   I'm thankful to have such a beautiful place to live
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.740]   where it's clean and it's bright and it's pretty
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.700]   and it's beautiful and it's safe and it's easy.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.340]   I turn on the tap and there's hot water
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.340]   and I plug something into the wall and there's electricity.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.780]   And so that would be an example for me.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.500]   Or another one is that I have to continually
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.980]   remind myself of, I'm very, me personally,
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.620]   I'm very much a people pleaser and it's difficult
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.940]   for me to go against the grain.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.140]   So I'm heavily influenced by peer pressure.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.580]   And so it's easy for me to feel like I've got to keep up
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.420]   with everyone else.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.300]   I've got to have the fanciest toy.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.300]   I've got to drive the fanciest car.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.480]   I need to look like everyone else.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.100]   But when I travel sometimes and all that's stripped away
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.140]   and I don't ever have to compare myself to the other people,
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.300]   then I learn to be a little bit more confident in me.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.940]   And so as an example, one of my visions for my life
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.900]   is I don't want to be disconnected from my family.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.740]   I don't want to live this common existence where I wake up
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.620]   early in the morning and I scarf down a bite to eat
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.060]   and then I'm away from my family for the next 10 hours
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.980]   and I come home exhausted at 6.30 at night
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.540]   or 7 o'clock at night, maybe my kids are already in bed
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.420]   and I scarf down some food and flip on the TV.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.900]   To me, that's not living.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.260]   So I've worked hard and I'm working hard on creating.
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.660]   I'm able, in the US-American context,
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.340]   I have three meals a day with my family.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:47.860]   I wake up and I work from home and I do work that I care about.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.620]   And then I still need to work on--
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.660]   and we try.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.940]   This afternoon, as soon as we finish up interviewing,
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.980]   it's a beautiful day here in South Florida.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.180]   And I've got some more work that I probably should do.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:58.940]   But you know what?
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.900]   It can wait.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.140]   And I'm going to take my family on a little adventure
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.780]   and figure that out.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:09.260]   So these lessons from travel can be applied in any context.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:12.860]   And you don't have to just be on the road.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.140]   You don't just have to live in an RV to live simply.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.780]   You don't just have to go to Costa Rica to learn Spanish
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.280]   and engage with new cultures and new cuisine.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:25.100]   You don't have to go and eat street food in Nicaragua
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:25.860]   to eat street food.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.620]   There's street food everywhere.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.500]   You can make a choice other than TGI Fridays.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:33.580]   And that's a lesson that I think we don't talk enough about.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.020]   Man, I so agree.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.080]   That is such a beautiful paradigm
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.020]   you have across the board there.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.580]   And I think that's the perspective
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.060]   you gain from getting out and having new experiences outside
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.180]   of our common experiences.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.560]   It makes you just come back with a different perspective.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.420]   I love that.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.620]   Oh, I love that.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.700]   I guess that's one thing I might add to that.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.900]   I think I would come back and try
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.500]   living in one of those tiny houses that are becoming
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:00.980]   popular, just to say, hey, we did it.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.100]   I don't know.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.020]   I think your wife is an adventurous sort.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.180]   But unless that tiny house is parked on the beach with six
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.700]   kids and the two of you, I think you need something
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   a little bigger, at least a fifth wheel.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.580]   Everybody is going crazy.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.860]   I floated that idea with my wife.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.580]   She didn't fly for it.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.860]   So I'm thankful.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.980]   And I'm thankful for it.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.500]   If I were a single person, maybe.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.840]   But like I said, we've got two kids.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.020]   And we're hoping for more in the future.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.540]   That's awesome.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.980]   So you need a little bit of space.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.900]   So Greg, we're-- let's see, discovershareinspire.com.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.700]   And then was it gregdenning.com?
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.980]   What are your websites?
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.420]   Yep, discovershareinspire.com, gregdenning.com,
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.940]   and then worldschoolacademy.com.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.060]   Man, I appreciate it so much.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:47.980]   You're coming on the show today.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.940]   This was super fun.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.740]   And I would encourage people to check out
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.060]   some of your adventures and others of your riding.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.260]   And I'll make sure to link to all that stuff in the notes.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:55.760]   Awesome.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.420]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.900]   This was really enjoyable.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.500]   Now, what do you need to apply from this to your life?
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.500]   Take it and apply it.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.180]   I think probably the biggest gem might be even there
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:08.780]   at the end.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.220]   Just because you're not traveling
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.060]   doesn't mean you can't live the life of adventure.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.500]   Plan it out.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.580]   Think it through.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.460]   Make a plan for how you can accomplish
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.060]   your personal adventure goals.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.020]   It really is pretty inconvenient in many ways
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.940]   live on the road.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.020]   A lot of benefits from it.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.020]   But it's also pretty inconvenient.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:31.020]   And if you can take the desire for adventure
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.260]   and apply it to your situation, it
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.740]   might bring a little bit more zest to your daily life.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.020]   Just a thought.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:38.940]   Walk around your town.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.420]   Schedule a tour with a tour guide of your town.
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.580]   Walk around your town with your phone
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.860]   and do a photojournalist shot.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.820]   Take pictures of interesting things.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.820]   I'm always a little bit envious of photographers
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.980]   because they seem to just notice so many interesting things
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.860]   because they're always looking through the lens of a camera.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:59.620]   Interesting buildings and interesting just stuff
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.500]   everywhere.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.580]   So how can you apply that to your life?
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.380]   I'm working on applying it to mine.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.420]   Thrilled to be here sharing the journey with you.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.220]   Thank you so much for each of you
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.380]   who are supporting the show.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.380]   Again, as mentioned in the beginning,
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.540]   if you'd like to make sure we keep the show here
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.100]   free of corporate interest, please
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.420]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.140]   I would be thrilled if you would do that.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.340]   It would help so much.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.220]   By June 1, the goal is by June 1,
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.140]   we need to get the show to $6,000 a month,
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.540]   and I can avoid taking advertising.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.420]   That would be in excess.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.340]   If I-- under the rates today of the listenership of the show,
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.260]   that's basically the number that I
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.420]   could get from advertisers with the number of shows
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.580]   that I do and the frequency.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.900]   It would be about that $5,000 to $6,000 a month number.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.580]   So that's why it's one of the goals.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.380]   If we can get to that with listener support,
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.660]   I would really love to do that.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.100]   So I just ask you for your help.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.180]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.220]   Tomorrow, I'll be back with a special show.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:07:00.060]   If you are a patron of the show, check out the Patreon page,
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.060]   the activity feed, for the details of that,
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.220]   and you can have input into it.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:04.720]   That's it.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.600]   See you all tomorrow.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:32.660]  ,
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.380]   Thank you for listening to--

[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.700]   If you'd like to contact me personally,

[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:56.500]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education,
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.100]   and financial enlightenment.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.500]   But your situation is unique, and I cannot deliver
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.780]   any actionable advice without knowing anything about you.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:11.260]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.700]   who you find to be caring, competent, and trustworthy,
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.260]   and consult them, because they are
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.740]   the ones who can understand your specific needs,
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.980]   your specific goals, and provide specific answers
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.820]   to your questions.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:30.620]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.580]   in today's show, but I'm one person, and I make mistakes.
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.820]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said,
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:39.260]   please help me by coming to the show page
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.460]   and commenting so we can all learn together.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.820]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
