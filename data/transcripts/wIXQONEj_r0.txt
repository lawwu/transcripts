[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.480]   During our last class period together, we began talking
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.200]   about some of the questions that could be asked
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.840]   in gathering good information, gathering good data,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.960]   asking appropriate questions, listening carefully.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   And we gave you some examples from a problem-centered approach
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.840]   and that is questions, the whole series of questions
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.960]   that are zeroed around particular problems
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.440]   that husbands and wives have and that they face.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.200]   Now, we're transitioning to questions
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.220]   of more positive perspective.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.320]   And let's take a look at a few of these.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   These are very helpful in counseling as well.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.440]   What ways do you seek to show that you care or love
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.520]   or appreciate your spouse or that other member
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.240]   of the family, your parents,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.760]   if you were addressing the children, or your children
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.560]   if you're addressing the parents.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.280]   What ways do you seek to show that you care, you love,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.280]   and you appreciate that particular person?
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.320]   This is also a good question if you have parents
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.280]   who are favoring one child over another.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   And that happens frequently.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.880]   The child that's not being favored,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.920]   and what ways do you seek to show that you really favor
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.280]   or at least love that person?
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.360]   Well, let's go back to the marriage.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.880]   Then what attracted you to your spouse is another question.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.360]   What were some of the things that attracted you?
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.720]   I mean, at this particular point in your marriage,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.680]   maybe all you see is that which is negative.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.320]   You see all the negative things that's going on in their life
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.160]   and that's repulsive to you.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.960]   So you have a difficulty respecting them
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.160]   and you have a difficulty loving them.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.560]   And I think we've talked about a little bit how respect
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.040]   in romantic love, this is only in romantic love,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.680]   respect always precedes love.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.000]   All right?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.640]   Respect always precedes love in romantic love.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.240]   Now, that isn't true in other types of love
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.640]   because the Bible says that we can, Jesus says there
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.920]   on the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, 43 through 48,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.160]   that we can even love our neighbors,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.840]   not just love our neighbors, but love our enemies.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.600]   And I don't know anybody that respects their enemies.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.120]   So in that particular case, that kind of love,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.680]   which is not a romantic type of love, doesn't necessarily assume
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.160]   or preclude, is precluded by respect.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.480]   However, romantic love is.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.280]   If there's going to be a romantic love,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.160]   you always respect that person before you love them.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120]   There are some marriages, however, who a husband
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.800]   or a wife or possibly both
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.520]   of them have lost respect for one another.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.960]   And so it's very difficult for them to think
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.720]   about anything positive about their spouse.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.840]   Now, that hasn't always been true.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.920]   They wouldn't have married that person
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.960]   if there wasn't something positive about them.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.120]   So way back, what was it that you saw
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.080]   in your spouse that was positive?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   What did you like?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.440]   What attracted you to that particular individual?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.080]   That's a good question.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.360]   Number three, tell us some fun times that you've had
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.040]   or fun things that you've done.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.840]   What have you done that has been fun in the past?
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   Sometimes in my undergraduate classes,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.840]   I try to encourage inter-gender relationships there
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.200]   at the college.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.520]   And so I tell them I give extra credit for girls and guys
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.800]   who date master's college students, all right?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.720]   And they always want to know how much that credit is and,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.520]   you know, and how many points do I get if I do this?
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.200]   What's it?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.640]   >> I'm dating one.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.600]   >> You are.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.680]   Yeah, you're dating one also, see?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.720]   See, they get extra credit.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.040]   But usually what I'm referring to is life credit, not points.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.920]   They get life credit.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.960]   They get a lot of credit.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.560]   That's pretty serious credit for doing that.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.920]   Now, don't tell them that.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.000]   Yes, you both are dating one of them, okay?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.800]   See, there you go.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.840]   And they'll get a lot of life credit for that.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.680]   So when they look back upon their relationship,
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.600]   every couple at one particular point
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.080]   or another had some really fun times.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.240]   Well, what happened during those fun times?
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.280]   What did you do?
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.040]   What -- and there are some people that are just
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.320]   in this mindset of thinking so negatively about their spouse,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.520]   it's very difficult for them to remember those times.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.560]   But once you get them thinking back through those times
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.480]   and remembering some of those good times,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.960]   that doesn't solve all the problems.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.080]   But that does help them to begin to think that, yes,
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.600]   there is a possibility where this relationship is
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.760]   worth saving.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.800]   It certainly would be a God-honoring thing for me
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.520]   to save this relationship and to work hard
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.840]   at making sure it was saved.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.600]   And then, again, while we still have our mind thinking
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.640]   about what has happened in the past, looking back,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.800]   what have you appreciated about your marriage or your spouse?
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.680]   What have you appreciated about them?
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.040]   Well, they've always told me the truth.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.480]   That's good.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   Always told me the truth.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.480]   Even though I haven't liked it, I'm good.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   I don't think they've ever lied to me.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.600]   That's good.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.160]   That's a good thing.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.360]   They've always been faithful to our marriage,
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.400]   at least physically.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.880]   I'll say to you, well, that's good.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.760]   That's a positive thing.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.360]   What have you really appreciated about them?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.960]   Well, he or she has a good head for figures.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.920]   They keep the books.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.720]   They keep the finances of the home.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.160]   And I appreciate that because I'm not so good at that.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.960]   Or he or she is a mechanic.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.920]   Or they love to fix things.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.160]   And I really appreciate that because I'm not really
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.640]   good at fixing things, like the automobile or the car.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.840]   Or he or she has a good sense of style.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.600]   I never know what to wear, and they always
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.640]   help me what I need to wear out in public.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.800]   So they have a good sense of style.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.760]   Do you help Andrew out with his style?
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.880]   You do.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.760]   That's a good seminary wife.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.280]   You'll be doing that a lot in ministry.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.680]   You say, you're not going to wear that to that conference.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.040]   No, no, no, not that tie and coat combination.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.320]   There's got to be something in it.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.360]   You made him change his tie today?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.120]   That's good.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.680]   That's good.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.760]   That's really good.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.160]   And that almost borders on a sin thing, doesn't it?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   I know, when it clashes.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.880]   But it's not sin, but it borders on it.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.840]   That's right.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.800]   So let them look back.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.000]   Let them point out those areas of their spouse
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.720]   that they really like, some things
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.040]   that they really appreciate.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   Let them think those things through.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.000]   That sometimes is really helpful in getting
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.880]   them to think good thoughts instead
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.940]   of the negative, pessimistic, God-dishonoring thoughts
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.000]   about their spouse that they seem to get stuck in.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.960]   Or here's another one.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.680]   What's the nicest thing that your spouse ever did for you?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.160]   What's the nicest thing they ever said to you?
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.960]   If they have a problem, then I start talking about,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   what about birthdays?
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.080]   What about Christmas holidays?
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:29.260]   What about early on during your anniversary?
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.340]   They ever do nice things for you?
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.840]   They ever do special things for you?
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.420]   What were they?
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:38.620]   We're zeroing in and taking a look
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.260]   at some of these positive things.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:47.340]   Or number six, in what ways have you
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.780]   seen your marriage relationship grown since you were married?
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:58.260]   Now, hopefully, they're going to point to something that's good.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.140]   Well, I've seen it grow in this area.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.460]   We're stronger off financially than we used to be,
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.380]   they may say.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.620]   We have more kids.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.420]   That's certainly true.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.940]   I've seen our family grow.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.860]   So in what ways?
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.980]   Or I have a better understanding of sin because of my spouse.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.160]   They may say that.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.660]   I've had people say that.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.460]   Or number seven, in years that you've been married,
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.020]   what have you done to make marriage successful?
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.300]   Now we, in a sense, put the shoe on the other foot.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.240]   It's not what their spouse has done for them.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.780]   Now we're sort of asking them, what
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.260]   have you done in order to make your marriage successful?
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:02.140]   Well, I've tried to do the right thing, you'll hear.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.300]   I've prayed an awful lot about the marriage.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.060]   Well, that's good.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.460]   I've tried to remain faithful at church.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.540]   Well, that's good, too.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.260]   What other things have you done in order
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.620]   to make your marriage a success?
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:26.700]   I've tried not to return evil for evil.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.260]   That's good.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:34.740]   What is successful?
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.540]   And what's successful in your eyes,
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.580]   but then what's successful in God's eyes?
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.580]   What would God say would be successful?
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.620]   What would he say, wow, this was really
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.220]   something positive that you contributed to this marriage?
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:56.380]   Number eight, tell me about some of your first time experiences.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:04.460]   Maybe it's when the two of you began to see each other,
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.180]   or you began dating, or you began courting.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.900]   Tell me about some of those first time experiences.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.500]   What happened?
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:18.940]   Earlier, I was teaching a class over at the college today,
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.740]   and it's actually a classroom full of girls.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.300]   We've got mostly girls in the class.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:32.300]   And they were really curious on how my wife and I
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   met each other.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.980]   And so I told the story of how we met each other.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.380]   Actually, my wife knew my sister in college.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:51.020]   And she needed a ride to a nearby town, Springfield, Ohio,
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.260]   actually, not far from where we went to school,
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.740]   in order to catch a bus to go home for the weekend.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.380]   Now effectively, she was going home
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.140]   to break up with her high school sweetheart.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.940]   But at that particular time, I didn't know that.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.780]   So she said to my sister, you know,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.060]   I need a ride to this town.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.740]   My sister said, well, you know, I think my brother has a car.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.900]   And I had a really fancy 1963 Ford Fairlane with big fins.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.580]   It was robin's egg blue, and it leaked oil like a sieve.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.780]   I had some kind of semblance of a vehicle.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.740]   It was a glorified go-kart, is what it was.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:45.740]   So one day when I was walking through the cafeteria line,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.420]   Janie, who is now my wife, was standing
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.540]   behind the cafeteria line.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.780]   And she says to me, I need to go to Springfield to catch a bus
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.620]   to go home for the weekend.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.940]   Would you be willing to take me there at this particular time
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.300]   so I can catch this bus?
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.060]   Now, I was faced with a horrible dilemma at that point,
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.020]   because part of my major was pastoral studies at the time.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.100]   So I was taking a Greek class.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.100]   And the very time that she wanted to go
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.060]   was during that Greek class.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.340]   And the professor was a guy by the name of Dr. George Lawler.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.660]   And Dr. George Lawler was one of those old-fashioned professors.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.700]   He always wore a three-piece suit and cuff links
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.820]   and always had a really nice tie on.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.540]   And he'd never stand up and teach.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.340]   He always sat down and teach.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.900]   And when we translated Greek, it was a Greek exegesis class,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.980]   he would always require the student--
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.900]   and he never referred to the student as by their first name.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.460]   He always referred to them by their last name.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.700]   Mr. Street, would you please stand and translate
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.420]   the next 10 verses for us?
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.180]   Parse all the verbs and participles.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.820]   And you're going, oh.
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.500]   So you'd stand up with your Greek text.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.220]   And your Greek text would be shaking like this.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.860]   And you'd go through and start translating and parsing
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.140]   all the verbs and the participles.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.940]   And he would always let you know when you messed up.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:26.940]   So you never, you never skipped Dr. Lawler's Greek class.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.580]   So I had this huge dilemma.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.260]   Pretty girl, Greek class.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.540]   Pretty girl, Greek class.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.420]   Which do I choose?
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.660]   This is horrible.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.020]   This is very, very difficult to make a choice.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.540]   Well, pretty girl won out.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.180]   There you go.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.380]   Pretty girl ran out.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.380]   Yes.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.340]   Won out.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.420]   And when she won out, I ended up taking her to Springfield.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.800]   And on the way up there, we had such a great conversation.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.180]   I'm thinking to myself, wow, I really need to ask her out.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.060]   I don't know how to do this.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.460]   And so we went to the bus station.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.820]   And there were some kind of unseemly guys there.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.180]   And so I just sat with her until the bus showed up
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.860]   and made sure she got on the bus.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.340]   And as she's getting on the bus, I somewhat
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.700]   said in a clumsy way, oh, by the way,
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.860]   I'll send you a bill for this.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.540]   And she kind of looked really surprised.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.580]   She says, OK.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.040]   So she went ahead and got on the bus
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.400]   and headed home for the weekend.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.180]   So I drove back to the dorm, and I thought,
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:24.740]   what am I going to do?
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.660]   What am I going to do?
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.540]   So I got a piece of paper and made out in hand calligraphy,
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.300]   do one date for John Street's taxi service.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.100]   All right.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.720]   Put it in a little envelope and sent it
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.960]   to her in inter-campus mail.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.540]   And after I sent it to her, I thought,
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.460]   oh, this is really corny.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.500]   Oh, this is really corny.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.660]   She's going to think this is really crazy.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.180]   So I went back to the inter-campus mail.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.260]   I said to the guy, listen, I need that thing back.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:49.780]   All right.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.700]   You need to give it back to me.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.300]   And the guy says, I'm sorry, sir.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.020]   I can't do that.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.220]   I said, this is not the US mail system.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.820]   This is just a little inter-campus mail system.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.020]   Give me my envelope back.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.900]   No, I'm sorry, sir.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.640]   It's got to go through.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.720]   Once you put it in there, it's got-- oh, I'm going.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.780]   Oh, man.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.500]   OK.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.740]   Well, that's the last time I'll ever hear from her.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.020]   So the weekend went by, two or three days into the next week.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.300]   And all of a sudden, I get this thing in the mail.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.180]   And it's an envelope.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.060]   And I open it up.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.220]   And there's a check for a million dollars worth of fund
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.660]   at the next basketball game.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.500]   And that was our first date.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.300]   And we still have those two pieces of paper.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.180]   All right.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.540]   I'm still cashing that check.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.940]   So that was our first date.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.420]   And then our second date, we doubled
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.140]   with my roommate in college.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.260]   My roommate was engaged to be married.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.340]   And we went out to get pizza.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.940]   And on the way there, back in those days--
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.040]   this was early 1970s.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.420]   That really dates me now, doesn't it?
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.900]   And you thought I was only 25.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.740]   I know.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.220]   Well, early 1970s, and we were on our way to get pizza.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.780]   And back in those days, you didn't
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.100]   even have to wear your seat belt.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.180]   And they had bench seats in the car.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.660]   And so his fiance is sitting real close to him
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.580]   in the front of the car.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.300]   And he's driving.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.460]   And Janie and I are in back seat at either ends
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.460]   of the back seat, OK?
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.820]   So we're on the way.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:30.780]   And his fiance leans over to him and says to him, I love you.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.100]   Just loud enough where we could hear it in the back seat.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.100]   And so I kind of looked over to Janie and I said,
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.620]   what did she say?
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.980]   And Janie looked at me and said, I love you.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.940]   No, no, no, what did she say?
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.740]   So on the second date, she told me she loved me.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.420]   I figure I had to marry her after that.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   So that's our first two dates.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.020]   That's what happened.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.100]   Now, every-- don't cry.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.780]   Every couple has stories like that.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.180]   They have stories like that.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.860]   And I'm sure if we went around, you guys
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.540]   could share your own stories with your wives on stuff
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.260]   that you remember and how you guys got together,
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.380]   and some of the fond things that you remember
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.980]   and some things you remember for the rest of your life.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.900]   Those are really great stories.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.220]   Well, when you're counseling a couple,
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.940]   they usually have stories like that.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.740]   And it's really good to get to know their history.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:46.060]   So ask them, tell me about some of your first time experiences.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.060]   Describe them for me.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.020]   What were you thinking at that particular time?
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.660]   Well, I thought that she was really, really
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.500]   a gorgeous gal.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.500]   I believed that he was really, really handsome guy.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.860]   Now look what's happened to him.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.740]   [LAUGHS]
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.100]   But what was going on?
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.300]   What happened in your relationship
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.980]   that helps you to get to know where they're coming from?
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.620]   That's not bad.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.500]   That's a good thing.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.380]   Then once you're able to establish
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.780]   some of those things that are more positive,
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.100]   then you can move slowly in the history of their relationship
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.180]   to where things began to go wrong.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.820]   Where did this relationship start to get derailed?
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.580]   There are probably signs way early in the relationship,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.900]   maybe even back before they were married,
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.340]   and how they were dealing with their problems that
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.540]   were signs or indicators of how they
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.700]   were going to derail a relationship later on.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.580]   Well, what was going on?
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.500]   Help them to identify those patterns.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.760]   Because if they're able to identify those patterns,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.380]   then that will help to ensure the fact
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.260]   that they won't fall into that in the future
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.420]   if they're aware of them.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.300]   This is the way we would wrongly deal with these patterns.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.700]   Here's the right way to deal with these patterns.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.580]   So number four.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.940]   Then respond to your counselees in such a way
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.260]   that fuller disclosure and understanding really
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.780]   is facilitated.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.340]   And this is what we call sometimes
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.260]   facilitated responses.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.300]   There's nothing technically or biblical about that term.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.460]   It's just a descriptive way of saying those kind of ways
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.260]   that you deal with your counselees
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.220]   to cause them to open up, to be more genuine with you,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:45.060]   to share more of their lives with you.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.420]   To the degree that they trust you
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.900]   is the degree that they'll share their lives with you.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.180]   To the degree that they believe that you
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.500]   have their long-term welfare in mind
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.740]   is the degree that they will share their life with you.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:16.140]   That's when you know that they are really seeking help
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.260]   is when they're being genuinely open.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:24.380]   Let me describe for you the general description
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.700]   of facilitated responses.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.380]   What we're talking about here is they
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.260]   are responses which the counselor communicates verbally
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.620]   and non-verbally, that he's heard
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.900]   what the counselee has said, he's
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.540]   heard what the counselee means, and he's
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.260]   heard what the counselee feels, how they're
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.980]   experiencing their problems.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.500]   He's heard what they've said.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.100]   He's heard what they've meant.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.660]   And he hears what they feel.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:09.060]   Facilitated responses are really characterized
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.500]   by three basic things.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:18.260]   One is empathy, reflecting accurately and fully
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.140]   the counselee's surface feelings.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.540]   That's really empathy.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.260]   This person is discouraged, or this person is hopeless.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.260]   There's a sense of hopelessness that abides.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:42.220]   This person is deeply regretful, or maybe even full of guilt
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.340]   over what has happened in their marriage
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.420]   or happened in their home.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:52.020]   Another aspect of it has to do with the issue of respect.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.380]   We come back to that issue again.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.580]   It communicates the acceptance of the counselee as a person,
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.820]   as a person created in the image of God.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.820]   So we're not going to demean anyone.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.620]   We're not going to run them down.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:12.060]   We're not going to let other people run them
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.740]   down during this counseling.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.980]   And that's easy to do, because you get a very verbal husband
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.140]   or get a very verbal wife.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.260]   And sometimes they'll want to spend--
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.380]   they use counseling as a means to vent
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.380]   all of their hard feelings.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.180]   And you cannot let that happen in counseling.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.060]   You're not going to get your counselees back
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.940]   if you let that happen.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.820]   Counseling is not to be turned into something
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.020]   that's destructive.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.700]   Counseling is always to be aimed in that which
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:50.460]   is godly or constructive, not destructive.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:57.020]   And you're demonstrating respect for both that husband
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.340]   and wife or the people that are members
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:05.860]   of that particular family when you accept them
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:11.900]   as a real person and that they have every right
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.980]   to contribute to what's going on here in this counseling
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.700]   process.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.220]   I remember not long after I had finished training,
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.820]   my first training course on biblical counseling,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.180]   I was a very young associate pastor.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.460]   And I had a man and his wife come in
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.420]   with their 25-year-old daughter.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.580]   And there was a major division between that daughter
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.540]   and her parents.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.020]   And during that counseling session--
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.860]   in fact, you can research this in the Journal
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.820]   of Biblical Counseling.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.580]   It's all written up there for posterity's sake.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.260]   It was written up back in the mid-1990s.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.940]   That counseling session was an absolute total failure
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.660]   from God's perspective and from my perspective
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.820]   because I let that father totally and totally,
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.180]   verbally destroy that daughter in that counseling session.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.180]   And I shouldn't have let that happen
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.100]   because I didn't communicate any kind of respect for her
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.700]   by letting that happen.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.460]   He used the counseling session as a way
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.140]   to vent all this bad feelings.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.620]   And she had enough faults.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.220]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.380]   But she wasn't the only one.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.540]   The parents had plenty of problems themselves.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.140]   They had contributed to what had gone on here.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.500]   But if you would have listened to that particular session
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.580]   and walked out, you probably would
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.580]   have concluded that she's the only one that's at fault here.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.380]   And the parents have not contributed anything to this.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:43.880]   Yes?
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.380]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.140]   How would have I changed, you mean, my response to them?
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   I would have-- the greatest word in counseling, by the way,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.780]   at least in English, is whoa.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.420]   All right?
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.580]   You may have a similar expression in Italian.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.340]   What?
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.020]   All right.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.740]   Well, in English, it's whoa.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.260]   I love that.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.980]   It's the greatest word in counseling
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.700]   because I would have said, whoa, stop, halt. All right?
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.740]   We're not going to do that to one another in counseling.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.740]   In fact, from that point on, I don't think I've ever--
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.200]   after that first counseling point,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.780]   I've ever allowed that to happen again.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.100]   Because I lost that gal.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.620]   I lost her when that happened.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.220]   Now, was the father saying things that were true about her?
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.020]   Yes, majority of things that he was saying was true.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.580]   But the way that he was saying them was all wrong.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.220]   He was using this to beat her into the ground with it.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.180]   And it shouldn't have happened.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.900]   And I shouldn't have allowed it to happen.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.580]   So you say, stop.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.900]   We're not going to do that.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.740]   This is a violation of Ephesians 4:29 that
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.420]   says we're only supposed to say things that build up
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.060]   one another, not tear one another down.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.540]   And I don't care whether you believe what you're
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.740]   saying is true or not.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.540]   That's not the issue at this point.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.740]   It's the way that you're saying things
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.540]   that makes this so wicked.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.980]   So you stop right now.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.740]   Now, if I would have done that in that counseling session,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.580]   I think that I probably would have won that gal's heart.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.080]   And I would have been able to work through a reconciliation
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.140]   with her parents.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.460]   But I didn't do that.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.020]   I let that father intimidate me.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.360]   I let him command the session.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.220]   And that shouldn't have happened.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.660]   Because he had major problems himself.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.780]   So this is why you've got to respect your counselees.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.140]   And that means sometimes you have to stand up for them.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.980]   If you have someone who is being ganged up on or piled up
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.780]   on in a counseling session, you've
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.420]   got to go after the members who are doing this.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.460]   Say, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.700]   We're not going to accomplish anything
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.860]   by piling up on this person.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:12.460]   And I think there's plenty of biblical evidence for this.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.220]   God cares for the helpless.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.340]   And in this particular case, this
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.700]   is a person who is helpless.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.180]   And you're letting someone gang up on them.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.340]   The last area of facilitated response
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.900]   is the concept of warmth, showing attentiveness
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.260]   and caring through nonverbal means.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.760]   You've got to be willing to do that.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.660]   Showing them that you care.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.140]   If you're constantly reading your Bible
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.300]   or taking notes or distracted by other things,
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.420]   and you're not involved with what's going on,
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.900]   you're not making eye contact with your counselee,
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.420]   and letting them know that you empathize with what
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.220]   is happening in their life, you'll lose them as a counselee.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.300]   There has to be a certain nonverbal means of showing them
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.780]   that you really care.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:13.260]   I think this is expressed in the little phraseology that's
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.540]   used in Ephesians 4.32, when he talks
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.900]   about being tender-hearted.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.780]   Be kind to one another, tender-hearted.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.780]   The word tender-hearted there is literally
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.780]   the Greek word tender-bowled, but it has to do with emotions.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.420]   Good Christians are tender emotionally.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.260]   That's good.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:38.140]   I think good pastors have a tender emotion.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.140]   That's a good thing.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.720]   They're not the CEO types who aren't unaffected
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.900]   by anything around them.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.140]   No, no, no.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.400]   The CEO types do not make good shepherds.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:55.580]   Where they're hard, cold, factual.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.580]   No, no, no, we have to be tender-hearted, tender-bowled.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.680]   Sometimes some translations translate it compassionate,
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.820]   and that speaks to the issue of emotions.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.160]   We have to be warm with people.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.140]   Some people have a problem with that.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.840]   They have a problem with being warm with other people.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   Sometimes this is true of all of us.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:33.800]   We want to communicate a biblical concept
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.480]   or some kind of teaching from Scripture so bad
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.000]   that we push aside all the emotional elements
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.880]   of the counseling and drive right after the opportunity
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.180]   to teach this truth.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.360]   And we're basically in the process,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.600]   I don't care how good that truth is,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.540]   you're basically communicating to your counseling,
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.700]   I don't really care about you.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.180]   I just want to care about dumping my truckload
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.820]   of truth on you.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.980]   I don't care about you.
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:10.540]   That does not create facilitated responses.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.540]   In fact, you'll see your counselees close up.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.500]   They'll withdraw.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.300]   You can almost physically see the barriers going up
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:19.940]   when that happens.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:25.700]   One of the things I do when we're supervising counselors,
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.820]   especially for certification,
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.840]   is we require them to turn in DVDs of their counseling.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.900]   They have to at least produce four DVDs
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.780]   where I have an opportunity to watch them counsel
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.040]   and watch how they interact with counselees,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.140]   which gives me more than just a written statement.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.700]   It helps me to see how they are dealing with people
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.280]   and whether or not people believe
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.580]   that the counselee is really there for their welfare
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.540]   and all of those nonverbal issues show up.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.400]   How warm are they?
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.020]   How caring are they?
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.480]   How respectful are they?
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.200]   How empathetic are they?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.720]   All of that encourages facilitated responses.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.240]   Now generally, that's what we're talking about.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.720]   Let's talk about this specifically.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.420]   Specific descriptions of facilitated responses.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.420]   They are responses that include instances
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.400]   in which the counselor's reflection
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.780]   of the counselee's statements are so similar
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.420]   to the counselee's statements
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.580]   that the two could be interchanged.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.940]   They're not identical, you understand,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.060]   but they are similar.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:40.460]   And I'll do this frequently in counseling where
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.140]   if a counselee
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:53.100]   shares something that's going on in their life
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.220]   and I've labored fairly hard
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.120]   to try to understand what's happening,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:02.280]   then I may say to them, okay, pause for a minute.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.140]   Whoa, again.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:10.140]   Let me share with you what I hear you saying
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.480]   and you tell me whether I'm right or wrong.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.880]   Here's what I hear you saying.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.580]   And I'll put it in my own words.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.040]   I won't try to repeat verbally,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.800]   word for word what they say
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.220]   so that they know that I'm kind of, in a sense,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.300]   pouring this through my own grid.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.560]   I'm thinking through it myself.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.600]   And they may say to me, oh, yeah, that's right on.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.240]   That's exactly it.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.400]   In fact, sometimes a counselee will say to me,
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.120]   you said it better than I did.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.960]   That's it.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.280]   Well, it's because I've had an opportunity
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.040]   to listen to them and I've synthesized what they're saying
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.760]   down, make it more succinct and concise.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.800]   Or sometimes a counselee will say to me,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.880]   no, no, no, that's not it.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.720]   That's not it.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   You missed it.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.680]   This is what I'm saying.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.440]   And that's very helpful to me.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.180]   I'm very open to that.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.400]   I want them to give me that feedback.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:11.760]   Because I may be totally thinking in a different direction
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.080]   based upon their words,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.120]   which is an entirely different meaning that they have.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.600]   Their meaning is this direction
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.140]   and I'm going this direction.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.560]   And all of a sudden now I realize I've got to turn around
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.760]   and head this direction.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.280]   All right, now tell me how that is.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.360]   And then the counselee corrects me.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.080]   And then I repeat back to them what I hear them saying.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.400]   Oh, yeah, now you got it, they'll say.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.900]   That's a facilitated response.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.500]   Now you say, now I'm beginning to see that counseling
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.300]   is much more than just sitting down with somebody,
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.900]   praying with them and sharing the Bible.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:35:00.340]   It has to, real good counseling.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.600]   It actually takes place within the context
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.660]   of a broader established relationship
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.980]   that we have shared together in Christ.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.000]   That's where good counseling takes place.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.700]   Furthermore, facilitated responses
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.060]   begin with listening and observing,
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.180]   responding to verbal and nonverbal clues.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:31.060]   Listening and observing and responding
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.060]   to verbal and nonverbal clues.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.660]   At some particular point when I begin to talk
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.500]   and share with the counselee what's going on
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.860]   and I see them grimace,
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.120]   they kind of get this look on their face like,
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.040]   I'll say to them, okay, what did I just say
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.700]   that made you do that?
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.500]   Which shows that I'm immediately responsive
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.600]   to what's going on.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:04.380]   Or they kind of look at me like, huh?
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.700]   What's going?
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.300]   Then I'm immediately saying to them,
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.780]   did I say something you don't understand?
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.520]   Well, let me correct that.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.700]   So I'm right there.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.540]   There's immediate feedback that they receive
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.140]   that I understand that they're lost.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.460]   I've totally lost them.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.940]   I'm not being clear.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.220]   Also, facilitated responses provide
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.140]   nonthreatening atmosphere for the counselee
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.320]   to express himself.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:46.060]   They know that they can say just about anything they want
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.820]   and I'm not gonna come down on 'em.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.980]   Or I'm not gonna start pointing at 'em and say,
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.020]   you're a sinner.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.940]   No, no, they can share whatever they want
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.340]   and then we're gonna patiently and carefully
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.660]   and lovingly go to the word of God
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.120]   and see what the word of God says about this.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:10.180]   Furthermore, facilitated responses avoid the use
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.860]   of certain verbal behaviors such as sarcasm,
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.760]   ridicule, or mockery.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:20.340]   You know, there are some people who have developed
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.360]   sarcasm as an art form in communication.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:31.220]   You can almost see them, oh, really?
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.940]   I just thought you were the most intelligent person
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.060]   on the earth.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.100]   Well, they mean that sarcastically.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.680]   They've developed it in an art form.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.660]   It's hard for them to talk without sarcasm.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.660]   Other people have done that also with ridicule.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.380]   They know how to politely ridicule another person
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.580]   or mock another person and they blame it
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.920]   on trying to be funny.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.340]   Well, that's an area that you as a pastoral counselor
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.060]   must avoid.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.800]   Don't do that.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:15.460]   Sarcasm, ridicule, mockery is something that will drive
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:21.740]   your counselees off.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:28.120]   In every case, a counselor who does that
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   is really coming from a high, exalted, lifted up position.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.580]   It's a very condescending way to deal with people.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:46.860]   That's not the way that people who are good counselors
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.380]   should respond to their counselees.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.860]   Fifth, facilitated responses also encourage
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.180]   self-exploration, discovery, and understanding.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.280]   And this is such an important point
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.240]   because on this particular point,
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.360]   this essentially says that your counselees
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.580]   don't always know everything that's going on in their lives.
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.240]   But through the process of counseling
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.400]   and being very open with you, they actually stumble on
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.640]   and discover things about themselves
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.040]   that they never knew before.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.740]   They actually discover that on their own.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   That's one of the things that makes Rogerian therapy work.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:44.060]   Carl Rogers' premise is that the counselor
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.460]   doesn't give any directive counsel at all,
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.680]   but just allows the counselee to sort of express
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.180]   his or her own internal thoughts.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.160]   And eventually, they'll discover the answer
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.920]   to their problem within themselves.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.200]   They don't know what it is, but the counselor helps them
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.640]   to get in touch with that kind of thing.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   Now, we believe that the answer is in Scripture, in God,
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.440]   so I'm not advocating the ends of that therapy.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   But part of the, truth is always parasitic,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.560]   or error is always parasitic on the truth,
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.680]   I should say it like that.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.640]   Error is always parasitic on the truth.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.280]   There's a little bit of truth to the system,
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.360]   and a little bit of the truth of the Rogerian system
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.960]   is the fact that people, through their own talking
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.840]   and expressing themselves and feeling free
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.800]   to express themselves, do learn things about themselves
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.200]   that they never knew before.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.260]   And sometimes that's the case.
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.860]   Facilitated responses, feeling free to express themselves
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.340]   without being condemned, without being judged,
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.760]   without being ridiculed, without being mocked,
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.300]   enables a person to discover certain things
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.300]   about themselves that they never thought would be true.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:05.860]   So,
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:14.860]   so make sure that these facilitated responses
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.960]   sort of encourage self-exploration.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.260]   Number six, not only that, but facilitated responses
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.340]   give people the rare experience of being understood
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.300]   by another person.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:32.440]   Some people never had that type of relationship before,
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.220]   especially in the church with someone else
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.160]   who's a Christian or who comes along
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.080]   and wants to biblically counsel them, or even a pastor.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.140]   The rare experience of being understood by another person.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:50.080]   Some people have been raised in households
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.900]   where their opinion counted for absolutely nothing.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.460]   Their mother didn't appreciate their opinions,
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.420]   their father didn't appreciate their opinions,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.300]   their siblings didn't appreciate their opinions,
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.860]   or maybe they're in a marriage where their spouse
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.340]   or other people in the family
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.940]   don't appreciate their opinion.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.380]   Whatever the case may be, nobody takes time
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:15.700]   to really understand them.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.460]   And so this is their first opportunity
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.460]   to really be understood by somebody else.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.420]   It's a loving and caring response.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.740]   Number seven, facilitated responses also largely avoid
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.280]   the use of closed questions,
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.600]   in that closed questions tend to,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.820]   and then we have several responses to that.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   Let's pick up here about these facilitated responses
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.720]   that largely avoid the use of closed questions,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.460]   in that closed questions tend to be, first of all,
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.980]   they tend to create a dependency relationship.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:06.820]   Closed questions artificially guide your counselee
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.520]   to answers, because they demand a yes or no answer.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.360]   And so they become, your counselee that is,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.700]   becomes dependent on those particular questions.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.160]   Oh, you're gonna guide me at this particular point.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.200]   You're gonna show me what I need to do here,
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   rather than them revealing what they are doing
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:39.080]   so that they can change and come in line
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.540]   with what the word of God says.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:44.180]   We don't wanna create dependency relationships.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.820]   That's not what we wanna do.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.180]   If anything, rather than teaching them
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.740]   to be dependent upon you, what you're trying to do
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.900]   is you're trying to teach them
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.460]   to be dependent upon the word.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.940]   Now, I realize that early in counseling,
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.780]   when a person first comes in
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.660]   and they're having major marital problems,
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.420]   they'll cling to you as their hope, okay?
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.300]   And that's okay, that's not bad at the beginning,
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.540]   for them to cling to you, all right?
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.760]   They've gotta cling to something,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.040]   because they may be absolutely hopeless,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:20.820]   and you are the one in the counseling room,
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.300]   you're the only one that has any hope.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.540]   So they'll cling to your hope, that's okay.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.060]   But if they continue to remain clinging to your hope,
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.360]   then we've got problems.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.100]   You gotta, in a sense, peel their fingers off of you
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   and help them cling to the hope of the word of God.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.420]   That's where they need to find their answers.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.260]   Not from you, but from the word of God on their own.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.940]   So we're in, the counseling process
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.500]   is removing their clinging hands from you
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.180]   to placing it upon the word.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   So closed questions tend to undermine that.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.140]   They tend to create a dependency relationship.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.340]   That's not what we want.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.540]   Furthermore, B, they also tend to produce
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.580]   unrealistic expectations on the part of the projects,
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.680]   or on the part of the counselee.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.440]   It projects the counselor as an expert and an answer giver.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:24.020]   We're the expert, and we're gonna tell you what to do.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.860]   Wow.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:29.660]   I don't want my counselee to think of me as an expert.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:35.180]   I want them to think of me as a fellow believer in Christ
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.300]   who has struggles, too, but hopefully knows
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.820]   a little bit more about the word of God
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.980]   and will help them to find the answers in the word of God.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.260]   I would far prefer that kind of a view.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.260]   Now we've got something.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.460]   But you're not the answer.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.320]   You're not going to be the priest or the final authority
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.420]   that's going to give them their answers
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.520]   to all their problems.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.920]   That's not what we're after.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   Furthermore, closed questions place responsibility
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.580]   for problem solving on the counselor
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:14.420]   instead of where it should be, that is on the counselee.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.300]   That's really where it should be.
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:25.380]   Responsibility for problem solving
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.140]   has to be on the counselee.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.740]   You're not there to solve all their problems.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.320]   In fact, you can't solve all their problems.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:39.420]   They've got to learn to solve their problems
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.780]   using the word of God.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.020]   So you're constantly having to shift
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.920]   that responsibility for problem solving
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.500]   where they're looking to you to solve all their problems
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.220]   back upon them, teaching them how to use the word of God
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.580]   the right way, hermeneutically, to solve their problems
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:02.300]   using the right scriptures, to think the right things,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:07.020]   desire the right things, crave the right things,
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.700]   do the right things, as counselees.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.300]   Furthermore, closed questions tend to reduce
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.780]   active involvement of the counselee
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.740]   in the solution of his or her problems.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.100]   They tend to reduce any kind of active involvement.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.540]   It really, the bottom line is,
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.940]   when you have closed questions,
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.900]   it produces the type of a counselee who is really lazy
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:49.440]   and really leans on or relies upon you
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.980]   for all the answers.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.920]   We don't want that.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.400]   Closed questions also reduce the counselee's acceptance
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.680]   of responsibility for his or her behavior.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:11.680]   And when you do that,
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.880]   then that's what they carry back into life.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:21.320]   Now, really, hope begins to return to a marriage
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.540]   that's willing, when you've got a husband and wife
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.480]   that's willing to accept responsibility
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.560]   for their own feelings and actions.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.600]   When that happens, a brand new freedom opens up to them
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.400]   to be able to respond to their spouse in the right way.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.480]   But as long as they define their spouse or their home
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.640]   or their family or their children
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   as creating an environment that forces them
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.960]   to act the way they do,
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.080]   as long as they keep defining the responsibility
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.540]   being upon my environment, my spouse, my kids,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.920]   as long as that's the case,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.160]   they will never ever really change.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.680]   And they will continue to lose hope
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.420]   because if everybody around me
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.000]   and what they're doing to me defines me,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.840]   then I have no really hope for change
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.300]   because I'm totally at the mercy of what they do.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:20.920]   But people don't define me.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.360]   What really defines me is my choices,
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.600]   how I respond to what people do.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.420]   People can say unloving, hateful, mean things to me,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:36.540]   and that can hurt, but how do I respond to that?
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.660]   I have a choice at that particular point.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:42.500]   I don't have to respond to it in like manner,
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   hatefully, mean, unloving, I don't have to do that.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.180]   I can respond to them in a caring, loving way.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:50:01.720]   So when you have closed questions in a counseling context,
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.640]   it reduces the counselee's acceptance
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.440]   of responsibility for his or her behavior.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.360]   Furthermore, closed questions
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.600]   reduce counselee self-exploration too,
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:16.560]   which is the opposite of what we talked about
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.120]   a little bit earlier, where the more open questions
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.500]   help them to explore,
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:29.080]   it encourages more facilitated responses,
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:32.860]   and it encourages more self-exploration.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:41.600]   Are there attitudes in my life that are harmful
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.480]   to our marital relationship
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.380]   that I don't even realize that I have?
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.100]   Ways that I respond to my wife,
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.120]   ways that I respond to my husband,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.380]   they can become so habitual,
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.420]   I don't even realize that I'm doing that.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:03.380]   What are those, and how can I see those?
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.980]   How can I learn those things?
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.720]   So closed questions tend to inhibit
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.060]   that kind of exploration.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.660]   Furthermore, closed questions create a lazy,
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.820]   inattentive counselee because the counselee
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.320]   doesn't have to think as hard.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.940]   Now, I've already suggested that just a little bit earlier,
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.620]   but it sort of puts their mind in neutral.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.960]   Lazy counselees don't grow very much,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:38.160]   and they don't grow very quickly,
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   and it is a lazy counselee that will be a counselee
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.580]   for a long, long time.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:52:00.540]   So make sure that you're going to use questions
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.260]   that facilitate good responses.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.420]   They don't inhibit good responses.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.660]   Furthermore, have couples or families then
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.640]   discuss controversial topics in the counseling room.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.180]   Boy, you'll really begin to see,
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   once this family trusts you as a counselor,
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.500]   you'll begin to see what's really going on
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.980]   in that marriage or in that home
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.980]   when finally you throw out a controversial topic
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.260]   and you begin to see how all the biblical guidelines
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.620]   and all the rules of communication
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.940]   are thrown out the window.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:48.380]   We'll talk a little bit later on
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.020]   about four rules of communication
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.060]   that I think are real effective
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.360]   in just helping people that have fallen into habit,
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.340]   terrible habit patterns,
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.340]   helping them institute those things in the home.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:06.520]   But bring up a controversial issue,
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.660]   a thing that they haven't settled
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.340]   that you know is hard for them
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.800]   and let them begin to discuss it in front of you.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.700]   You'll learn a lot about what's going on there.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.340]   Then give data gathering homework
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.400]   that can be completed between sessions.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.020]   You'll learn a lot from this homework.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.580]   You'll learn a lot just by virtue of the fact
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.820]   that sometimes it's incomplete
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.900]   or they don't see the homework as important
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.120]   to their change.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:43.380]   Sometimes there's published materials.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.500]   Wayne Max has his homework volumes.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:49.460]   Volumes, materials like preparing marriage for God's way.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.140]   There's a lot of data gathering there,
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.820]   strengthening your marriage, your family God's way.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:01.720]   Data gathering inventory forms.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.680]   You can get this in the back of a lot of J. Adams books
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.520]   as well.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.360]   Yes.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.700]   >> What kind of homework do you give them
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.380]   when you're pre-counseling?
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.220]   >> When you what?
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.540]   >> When you're pre-counseling.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.640]   >> Pre-counseling?
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.020]   >> Yeah, when you know that the counselee is not saved
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.900]   and they come to you for counsel.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.120]   >> Oh, oh, what kind of homeworks do we give
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.900]   during pre-counseling if the counselee's not saved?
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.500]   All we send it around the gospel.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.780]   We send them home studying passages about the gospel.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.380]   Sometimes even the Roman's Road.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.580]   We'll take them through the Roman's Road.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.140]   Help them to understand it.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.820]   We'll list a bunch of passages of scripture.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.660]   In fact, many times I'll take a Bible.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.660]   If they don't have one, I'll give it to them.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.380]   And then I'll take little sticky notes
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.820]   and I'll stick them in different places in the Bible
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.060]   and write references down.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.180]   And I want them to read them this week
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.420]   and interact with them.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:58.420]   And I'll give them good tracks like John Blanchard's material
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.340]   that's translated in several different languages.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.640]   His tracks on ultimate questions.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.340]   So I'll give them material like that to go home and read.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.660]   And I'll say to them, listen,
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.500]   I want you to read this through
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.880]   and I want you to take a highlighter and highlight
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.580]   maybe four or five of the most important statements
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.700]   in this particular booklet.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.200]   And we'll come back together and discuss them.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.240]   So that's the kind of homework that we'll do with them.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.420]   All right.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:34.420]   Then we've got data gathering inventory forms as well,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.220]   like there are common ways that husbands and wives
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.940]   sin against each other.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.340]   You can actually develop some of these on your own
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.720]   or fail or offend.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.080]   Deep friendship inventory.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.040]   Understanding marriage biblically.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.680]   How to be your wife's lover.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.800]   How to be your husband's lover.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.260]   50 questions for husbands and wives to ask themselves.
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.860]   50 questions for husbands to ask.
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:13.700]   I think that repeats itself there twice.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:14.660]   It shouldn't be there.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.280]   Role concepts, how they view roles.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:23.300]   Sometimes some of that homework you can also find
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.780]   in Wayne Mack's Preparing for Marriage God's Way,
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.300]   which is a really good book.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.600]   And I use that frequently in premarital counseling.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.060]   So there's a host of different materials
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.300]   that you can use in order to gather good data.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.140]   And you can customize a lot of material as well.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:50.100]   Like you can send them home with lists, like thank lists.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.260]   What are they thankful for?
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.020]   Prayer lists or confession lists.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.100]   Or there can be journals, like a heart journal
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.300]   or a thought journal or a fear journal.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:05.300]   Or sometimes I refer to them as a hate journal.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.980]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:09.180]   Let's go over to Romans chapter 12.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:24.180]   And verse nine.
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:28.380]   There Paul says, let love be without hypocrisy.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.680]   Abhor what is evil and cling to what is good.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.580]   The word abhor is the word hate.
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.540]   It's the same word.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.620]   It can be just as legitimately translated hate.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.940]   And I like to use that as an acrostic.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.680]   Let me see if I can show this to you on the board here.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:56.560]   H-A-T-E.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.560]   Christians need to hate more, all right?
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:06.000]   That'd be a good sermon for you guys to preach.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.480]   Christians need to hate more.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.220]   Because everybody's preaching about
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.200]   Christians need to love more.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.620]   We need to hate sin more.
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:18.220]   Now, when they get angry at their spouse,
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.920]   or they get irritated with their spouse,
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.500]   or frustrated with their spouse,
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.620]   or upset because of something their spouse has done,
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.700]   and they know that they respond to that
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.260]   in a very sinful way,
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.460]   then you need to help them to journal.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.740]   Number one, here.
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:41.020]   They need to answer the question in their journal.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:46.580]   What happened?
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:52.720]   It's the first question they need to answer.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.560]   What happened?
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.340]   Just tell us the circumstances.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.180]   What went on?
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:01.460]   Number two.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:09.620]   In their journal, you want them to also list
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:19.540]   how did you act?
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.720]   In their journal, you want them to also list
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.540]   how did you act?
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:30.720]   How did you act?
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:36.680]   How did you respond to what happened to you
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.100]   when your spouse yelled at you?
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:45.580]   When you had that argument over finances?
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.080]   How did you act?
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   Or, number three, get them to journal
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.820]   and answer this question.
[00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:00.540]   What?
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:06.500]   Well, it would be better to say here.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:17.020]   What were you doing?
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   What were you thinking at the time?
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:35.740]   Or, kind of as a subset to that, what did you want?
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:41.020]   What did you crave?
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.740]   What do you desire more than anything else?
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.060]   That helps them to reflect upon their own mind,
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.400]   their own thought life.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:01:01.340]   And then, last of all, you want them to answer
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:13.620]   what is excellent or praiseworthy.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.180]   [birds chirping]
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:26.820]   This is based upon Philippians chapter four and verse eight.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:34.340]   What is excellent or praiseworthy?
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:39.540]   In other words, you want them to answer the question,
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.620]   this is what happened, how should I have acted?
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.500]   What should have I been thinking?
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:49.300]   What should I have wanted in this situation?
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   What should I have desired in this situation?
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.180]   And then, what is excellent?
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:02.100]   That tells us what is excellent in this case.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:07.100]   So, that's why we call it the hate journal.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:12.100]   They learn to hate areas of their life
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:17.100]   that are evil and then cling to that which is good.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.980]   Help them to do that.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.380]   Hate what is evil and cling to that which is good.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.660]   So, help them do a heart journal.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.180]   Help them do a thought journal or a fear journal
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.140]   or a journal of upsets.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.440]   Or, you can call it a hate journal.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.740]   But, get them answering questions like that,
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.460]   which gives you a lot of feedback
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.060]   about what's going on in their home.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.700]   Thirdly, study scripture passages.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.620]   Where are they failing?
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:50.160]   In obeying the truth of the word of God.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.860]   Or, record expenses.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:59.840]   Maybe sometimes home software budgeting can help you here
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.180]   to keep track of expenses,
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.540]   especially if they have problems with finances
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.700]   or they have fights or disagreements about finances
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.380]   in the home.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.900]   Recording expenses.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.240]   It can be as simple as just a series of envelopes
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.820]   where they have food expenses, transportation expenses,
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.540]   home expenses, and they just put their little receipts
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.860]   inside those little envelopes.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.600]   So, it doesn't have to be anything complicated,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.860]   even if they don't have a computer.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.000]   But, if they have a computer,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.540]   sometimes there's wonderful software
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.220]   and if they know enough,
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:35.220]   they can just take an Excel sheet
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:39.300]   and make their own track of expenses.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.100]   They don't even have to buy special software to do that.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.420]   Or, 1 Corinthians 13, four through eight,
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.860]   help them to study, define, and create a plan
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.660]   to implement godly love for one another.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.980]   Sometimes I have them divide a piece of paper
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.340]   into three columns lengthwise.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.500]   In one column, I want them to define each term
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.580]   in 1 Corinthians 13, four through six,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.700]   love is patient, love is kind.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.500]   I want them to define that in one column.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.180]   In the second column, I want them to think about
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.780]   all the areas where they need to change.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.580]   That is, all the areas where they fail.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.420]   I want them to list as many examples of that as possible.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.020]   Will I fail to be kind when I, whatever.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.860]   And then, in the third column,
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.980]   then I want them to list what do they need to do
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.100]   in order to change.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:37.400]   If they're going to implement kindness,
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.100]   if they're going to implement patience,
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:44.600]   if they're going to implement gentleness
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:52.100]   as an aspect of love, then what do they need to do
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.840]   in order to change and be that way?
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.060]   That's the third column.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:57.900]   Yes.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.900]   [student speaks off microphone]
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.960]   The first column is the definition of all the terms
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.100]   there in the Bible in 1 Corinthians 13.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.220]   That's the first column.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.060]   Definition.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.100]   So, they're defining it as best as they can.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.900]   The second column is all the areas where they're failing.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.700]   And the third column is all the areas
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.520]   where they need to change and how they intend to change.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.100]   That's the third column.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.860]   Then, number six.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.260]   There's high points and low points record.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.260]   What are the high points of their relationship
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.160]   this past week?
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.480]   What are some of the things that they look back on
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.920]   and say, "Wow, that was, you know, we had a good time.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.760]   "That was good."
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.660]   And then, what were the bad times as well?
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.780]   High and low points.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.820]   Or, tapes of communication conferences.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.460]   Audio, CD, DVDs.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.380]   There's so much material available,
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.700]   so much more than when I first started in
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   as a biblical counselor.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.100]   You can get online, MP3 downloads.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.680]   There's just so much material
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.140]   that you can get them to listen to.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.500]   Say, "I want you to go to a website like soundword.com.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.980]   "And when you go to soundword.com,
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.820]   "I want you to look up underneath
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.400]   "the National Association of Euthetic Counselors
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.400]   "the following seminars or workshops
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:23.800]   "that have been done on marital communication
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.100]   "or marital strife.
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.620]   "I want you to listen to those.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.620]   "I want you to keep notes.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.840]   "And in our next counseling session,
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.440]   "I want you to bring those in."
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.600]   So, there's a host of other places
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.560]   that you can get materials.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.380]   For example, the counseling department
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.680]   here at Master College and Seminary
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.480]   on a yearly basis has a women discipling women's conference
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.400]   and a men discipling men's conference.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.000]   And all the sessions, all the main sessions
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.420]   are not only audio recorded, but also recorded on DVDs.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.320]   And then every one of the workshops
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   are at least audio recorded.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.300]   And so, you can get a hold of those kind of things
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.720]   and use them for homework as well.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.640]   The only thing I caution you on
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.520]   is not everything out there in the Christian bookstore
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.320]   or everything out there that purports to be Christian
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.700]   in terms of helping marriages is really biblical.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.740]   So, you've gotta be really careful.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:25.100]   Be very, very careful that your source is a good source.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.160]   All of this helps you to gather data,
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.520]   to get to know this particular couple a little bit better.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.800]   Now, as you gather this data,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.320]   this couple doesn't look like a happy couple here,
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.640]   look for evidence that would either confirm the presence
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.420]   or the absence of some of the most common marital problems.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:48.240]   You say, what are those?
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.260]   Well, let me give you a list of some of the more common ones.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.280]   Look for stuff like this.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.260]   Disagreements on concepts of marriage.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.740]   What is his concept of marriage
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.540]   and what is her concept of marriage?
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:04.580]   Or, differing expectations.
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.080]   I expected him to be this way in marriage
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.180]   or I expected her to be this way in marriage.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.200]   How are those expectations different?
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.880]   Or, maybe either of them or maybe both of them
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.600]   come out of churches that were not taught well
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.160]   and so, they really don't have a biblical understanding
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.640]   of roles and responsibilities of the husband.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.820]   Or, role and responsibility of a wife.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:37.180]   So, how is their training,
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.380]   their biblical training in their background,
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:42.260]   contributing to their problems in their marriage
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.760]   or lack of biblical training?
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:49.240]   How did they go about making decisions?
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:56.080]   Is it based upon rationalism?
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.000]   Is it based upon emotionalism?
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.300]   Is it based upon biblical criteria?
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:10.340]   Or, maybe a falsely understood biblical criteria,
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.100]   falsely interpreted Bible.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.500]   How did they make decisions?
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:18.900]   How do they go about resolving conflicts
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.380]   when there is a conflict?
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:24.140]   Do they have the right kind of attitudes?
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.580]   Do they see the goal
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.400]   at the end of this conflict resolution winning?
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.740]   Or, do they see the goal glorifying God?
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.920]   What is it?
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.820]   Do I have to win this conflict?
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.220]   Do I have to win this argument?
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.100]   Or, is my real goal here to glorify God?
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.940]   What is it?
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.860]   What kind of communication difficulties do they have?
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.660]   Maybe you get one spouse that's very, very verbal
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.940]   and another spouse that is a person
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.340]   who clams up all the time.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.180]   They're quiet.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.580]   They hardly ever say anything.
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:06.520]   Or, what are their growth objectives?
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.860]   What do they really wanna do?
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:15.700]   We wanna work real hard so we can have a lot of money.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.700]   One of you came up to me during our break time
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.680]   and talked a little bit about a couple that was that way.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.180]   And, it seems like their goal
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.540]   in their marital relationship
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.560]   is get as much money as they can.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.080]   That's their goal.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.460]   And so, they're sacrificing their relationship
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.900]   and they're sacrificing their kids on that altar.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.580]   They're really materialists,
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:43.680]   even though they profess to be Christians.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.620]   They have the rich young ruler syndrome
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.420]   where they're interested in what they possess
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.920]   more than they are interested in following Christ.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.580]   Then, there's occupational objectives.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:04.900]   He has an idea of what he wants his occupation to be
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.780]   and how he's going to fulfill the responsibilities.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.140]   Maybe she has a desire to have an occupation
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.500]   outside of the home.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.780]   That can cause a considerable amount of conflict
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:15.980]   in a Christian marriage.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.960]   Maybe he wants her to have a job outside the home,
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.760]   or maybe he doesn't want her to have a job outside the home,
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.840]   or maybe she wants her husband to have a different job
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.160]   where it makes more money,
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.640]   but he's not really happy in the job
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.920]   that really makes more money.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.340]   He doesn't think he's gifted in that particular job.
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.520]   That can cause some difficulties.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:46.840]   Then, there could also be intramarital marriage boundaries.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.020]   Now, this has to do with what boundaries do we have
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.160]   with other couples that are close friends?
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.560]   How many boundaries do we have?
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.000]   What are they allowed to do in our home
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.700]   and not allowed to do in our home?
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.800]   Where do they stay when they come
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.540]   to stay overnight in our home?
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:14.640]   How many boundaries are there with friends?
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.240]   He maybe grew up in a household
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.360]   where his parents allowed their friends
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.960]   to walk in any time, any day, any time, day or night.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.120]   They didn't even have to knock.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.000]   Door's always open.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:29.840]   Come on in.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.400]   She grew up in a home where the door was always locked
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.640]   and people had to come (knocking)
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.940]   and knock on the door before they come in,
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:44.480]   or maybe a more Jewish or Mediterranean culture
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.880]   where you clap before you come in.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.920]   Well, how are you gonna deal with that?
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:58.080]   She thinks it's incredibly rude
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.120]   for people to just walk in on you.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.740]   So, where are the boundaries there?
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.920]   What do you talk about?
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.240]   Maybe they're having problems
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.880]   in their physical relationship with one another,
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.080]   and she goes and talks to her girlfriends
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.960]   about those problems,
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.120]   and he's greatly offended about that.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.220]   Don't go sharing all of that,
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:27.160]   or maybe she's very private about those issues,
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.880]   and he goes and talks with his boyfriends
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.480]   about the problems that he's having,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.880]   and she's greatly offended by that.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.720]   What are the boundaries?
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.240]   Where are they?
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.820]   Or there are extended family boundaries as well.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.180]   How much do we let mom and dad, aunts and uncles,
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.240]   other siblings, brothers and sisters,
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.700]   know about what's going on in our marriage?
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:56.600]   He or she may think that there's no problem with that.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.200]   So, I let my mom and dad know
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.440]   everything that's going on in our marriage.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.400]   I let my siblings know everything
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   that's going on in our marriage,
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.040]   and their spouse gets really offended at that.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.920]   No, that's for us.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.580]   That's private information.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.880]   You don't share that.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.120]   That can cause a lot of problems.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.880]   Or there could be religious spiritual issues.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.560]   She likes this church over here,
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.200]   and he likes this church over here,
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.360]   and they're both Bible-teaching,
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:31.360]   conservative, Bible-believing, expository churches.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.840]   She likes this one, and he likes this one.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.300]   Could be a problem.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.140]   Or there's ethical standards.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:50.100]   Maybe she was reared in a culture of situational ethics,
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:56.460]   where it's okay on very rare occasions to tell lies
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.740]   if you believe that's going to be for the good
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.380]   in the long run.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.900]   And she uses examples of that.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.740]   I mean, Rahab did that.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.780]   She told lies about the spy, right?
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.300]   About the spy, right?
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:15.020]   Sarah did that for Abraham.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.180]   He told, she told lies.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.140]   She said that she was his sister
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.660]   in order to save his skin.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:26.180]   And the Bible doesn't say anything negative about Sarah
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.380]   for doing that, does it?
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:31.540]   And so, she came out of a situation where,
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:35.580]   or an environment where it was okay to tell a lie sometimes.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.220]   And he comes out of an environment where,
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:41.920]   no, it's not okay to tell a lie, ever to tell a lie.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.140]   You shouldn't do that.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.900]   So there's differences in ethical standards.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:54.800]   There's differences in family life, in family life.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:03.080]   I grew up in a home where my mother every Sunday,
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:09.140]   every Sunday had a big meal, Sunday afternoon.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:12.700]   I mean, she would kill the fatted calf.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:19.000]   She would have mashed potatoes, gravy, roast beef,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.620]   green beans, corn, you know, she would just lay it out.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.320]   Sunday afternoon was always the big meal of the week.
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.780]   My wife grew up in the type of a family
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.380]   where her mother would set out loaf of bread,
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:40.620]   bologna, ketchup, mustard.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.260]   You were free to go by and get anything
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.900]   if you were hungry or you wanted.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:49.160]   So, you get married.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.700]   The first Sunday we're married,
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.780]   what is this bologna sitting on the table?
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.680]   Where's my roast beef?
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.920]   What is this?
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.920]   [laughs]
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:09.800]   So there can be differences when people get married
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.520]   in family life and expectations.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.200]   Sometimes I talk with this when I'm doing
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.240]   premarital couple, counseling with couples,
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:22.240]   and what's gonna happen the first holiday that comes up?
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.760]   Like Christmas.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.480]   Well, she automatically thinks we're gonna go
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.040]   to my parents' house for Christmas,
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.740]   and he automatically thinks we're gonna go
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.800]   to my parents' house for Christmas.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.080]   And then sometimes the parents throw different incentives
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.440]   to come to their various houses in there, all right?
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.260]   If you come to our house, then whatever.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:50.980]   Well, that can cause problems in terms of family life.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.840]   Then there's social involvement and friendships.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.880]   How involved should he get with his golfing buddies
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.520]   and his friends or his friends where he goes fishing,
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.500]   and how involved should she get with the girls
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.460]   that she goes out to movies with,
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.180]   and how involved is all of this?
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:20.960]   They're married now, this is different.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.840]   Their primary relationship is to each other.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.080]   Or there's also different ideas about finances, too.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:41.160]   She grows up in a home where, boy,
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:46.160]   mom and dad pinched every penny, pinched every penny.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:54.240]   And you never buy anything, anything,
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.560]   unless you can find the absolute cheapest thing to buy.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:04.480]   And so you look for the cheapest thing.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.760]   And he goes out and takes the money,
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.200]   and he buys something kind of frivolously,
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.440]   and gets home, and she just erupts.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.820]   What have you done?
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:19.180]   You can't do this with our money.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.760]   You're gonna bankrupt us.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.940]   What did I do?
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.600]   I didn't do it, I just, you know.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.200]   I saw it, it was on a pretty good price,
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.760]   and I thought it would be good for us.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.720]   He thought he was doing something good.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.120]   Could be a pretty big problem.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.640]   Different view of finances.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.320]   Different view of sexual relationships.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.760]   When you teach them, and later on we'll talk about this
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.160]   from 1 Corinthians chapter seven,
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.300]   but when you teach them that their role
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:52.520]   in a sexual relationship is the fulfillment of their spouse,
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.680]   even with that biblical understanding
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.360]   tucked under their belt that they take
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.520]   into the physical relationship,
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.600]   still a Christian couple will have a tendency
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.040]   to pass each other in the,
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.280]   they're like ships passing in the night.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.120]   Why?
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.520]   Because she will try to fulfill him sexually
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.840]   the way that a girl would be fulfilled,
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.140]   and she, or he, would try to fulfill her
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.080]   the way a guy would be fulfilled,
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.980]   and they're like two ships totally missing each other.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.380]   Different views of the physical relationship in marriage.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.980]   That can become a problem.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:37.600]   Or there's different views, especially in terms of priority,
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.800]   of finances and material things.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.240]   How important are finances?
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.440]   For him, it may be vitally important.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.000]   For her, it's not as important.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.120]   Material things are really important.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.320]   I've got to keep up the Joneses.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.920]   I've got to keep up this lifestyle.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.440]   This isn't, but for her, that's not important,
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.380]   or vice versa.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:08.160]   Or sometimes there is even recreational concerns.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:13.520]   What are we gonna get involved with recreationally?
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.160]   The things that he enjoys is different
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.760]   than the things that she enjoys.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.740]   What can they enjoy together?
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.740]   - She's not gonna sit on the couch and watch football.
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:29.880]   - She's not gonna sit on the couch and watch football.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.780]   No, I don't think that's gonna happen.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:35.700]   Unless she really likes football.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.260]   Maybe she had a father and brothers
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.340]   who were really into football,
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:40.600]   and so she grew up learning to like football,
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.020]   or she really likes baseball,
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.380]   or she really likes soccer, whatever.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:48.660]   What's that?
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.820]   - She's gonna like soccer.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.220]   - She's gonna like soccer.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:59.700]   You want me to quiz her and see if that's true, or?
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:08.220]   All right, or there's also just lifestyle
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.660]   nitty gritty issues, like for example, this.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:20.340]   Let's say that she grew up in a home
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.340]   where everybody in the household
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.740]   ran around the household in their underwear.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:29.500]   Everybody in the household ran around like that.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:30.940]   That's the way everybody did.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.540]   The girls and the guys all ran around in their underwear.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.180]   It was no big deal.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.060]   He did not grow up in that kind of a household.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:45.380]   He grew up in a household where once you leave the room,
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.420]   that wherever you sleep at night, you're fully dressed.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:52.700]   None of this running around in underwear, right?
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:56.880]   So, her parents come to visit,
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:03.100]   and she shows up outside her room in her underwear,
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.780]   and so do her parents, and he's horrified.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:10.040]   What is this?
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.420]   This is in my house.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.020]   This is not gonna go on in my house.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.780]   This is terrible, right?
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:22.140]   Well, to her, it's nothing.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:22.980]   That's what?
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.180]   What is the big problem?
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:29.060]   Wow, are you uptight, she says.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:29.900]   I'm not uptight.
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.020]   This is the way I was raised.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.940]   You don't walk out of your room unless you have clothes on.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:37.340]   That's the way it goes,
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.580]   but that can cause quite a bit of conflict, you see.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.120]   Difficult issues.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   She maybe was raised in a household where you could talk
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:56.600]   about kind of girly things right out in the open
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.720]   in front of the brothers and everybody.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.800]   He was not raised in that kind of a house,
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:06.240]   and so one day, she's there sitting
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.000]   with extended family members and talking
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.080]   about all these things in public,
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.000]   and he's horrified at what his wife is saying.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.200]   Or maybe it's vice versa.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.000]   Maybe he's the one that's talking about all the kinds
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.560]   of womanly things out in public
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.040]   in front of the extended relatives,
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.400]   and she's the one that was raised in a household.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.760]   You don't talk about that.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   Why, only the women talked about this among themselves.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.280]   She's the one that's horrified at what he's saying,
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.140]   and she can't wait to get him behind closed doors
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.680]   and say, what are you doing?
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.120]   All those little nitty gritty things that come up
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.040]   in marriage that bring out our sinful nature,
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040]   our depravity, what we really want,
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.240]   what we're really craving for.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.800]   We have a conception of the way
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.560]   that we want our marriage to be,
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.840]   and somehow that person is not fitting our expectations
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.800]   or our conception.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.120]   That can cause a lot of difficulty,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.720]   and you need to find that out in your counselees.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.960]   What's going on there?
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.680]   What's happening there?
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.400]   Because this is where the word of God
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.440]   tremendously changes people in the nitty gritty,
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.600]   in the little details of life.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.200]   This is what makes marriages really, really improve
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.480]   to God's honor and glory,
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.320]   but you've got to get down on that level
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.880]   and know how to address the specifics of that level
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:42.000]   if you're gonna see any success
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.640]   in ministering the word of God.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.200]   Now, if all you're interested in is dispensing the Bible,
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.680]   then you're not gonna get into the nitty gritty,
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.800]   but if you really wanna minister the word of God,
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.380]   that means minister it in such a way
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:58.320]   that it gets down to the fine details of their life,
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.680]   then you're gonna need to know some of those things,
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.660]   not because you're curious.
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.380]   I tell people, boy, God got rid of my curiosity years ago.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:11.100]   I know way too much about way too many people.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.720]   I don't have one bit of curiosity left in my entire body.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.560]   It's nothing.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.460]   I don't wanna know anything about anybody,
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.460]   but I will if I'm gonna help them.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.660]   I don't have any curiosity left.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.660]   I really don't,
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:34.060]   but I want to hear because for one reason,
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:37.860]   I can't help you if I'm operating in the dark.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:39.740]   I gotta know what's going on in your home.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.300]   I gotta know what's going on in your marriage.
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.700]   I've gotta know what's going on on a day-to-day basis,
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.700]   and that helps me to put all the pieces
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:48.900]   of the puzzle together
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:55.380]   and then diagnose the problem from the word of God
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.680]   and find God's answers to those problems.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.340]   (pensive music)
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.000]   (pensive music)
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
