[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   One of the major themes I talk about here is how to tame overload in your life and work,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.580]   the type that can be supercharged by modern technology to the place where you really have
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.840]   no space left in your life to cultivate more depth.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.280]   So how do we tame that overload is a question I care about.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.220]   Today I want to talk about a way of thinking about this problem that I have found useful
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.200]   in my own life.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.400]   It describes a trap that I, myself, have fallen into and gives some glimpse of a way out.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.840]   What's interesting is I was thinking about this concept and around that same time I noticed
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.320]   that Tim Ferriss was working on a new book, and I think he's calling it The No Book, and
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440]   he had, and I have it on the screen here for people who are watching, he's still writing
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.680]   it, but he posted the introduction on his website and when I was reading the introduction
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.900]   of his book, I said, "Oh, wait a second.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.360]   What Tim is thinking and writing about in this book really overlaps this idea that I've
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360]   been toying with."
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.840]   So what I really want to do here is I'm going to read you an excerpt from the introduction
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.160]   to Tim Ferriss's pending next book, The No Book, and then I am going to introduce my
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.880]   concept of a metaphor for it and we'll keep returning to Tim's story to try to help tease
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.040]   out what I mean by that metaphor and what the ideas are I'm dealing with, right?
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.120]   So we've got a little bit of a complex web here of ideas, but I think it'll make it interesting.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.340]   All right, so I have Tim's introduction draft up here on the screen.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.600]   I am going to just read an excerpt from it.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.800]   All right, this is from Tim's introduction.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.920]   I first realized I had a problem when everything was going right for me.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.880]   The day was May 2, 2007, just after 5.30 p.m. in New York when I received a phone call I'll
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   never forget.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.320]   My editor at Random House wanted to inform me that my debut book, The 4-Hour Workweek,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.080]   had hit the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.520]   As her words sunk in, I staggered backwards and collapsed against a wall in shock, gratitude,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   and relief.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.280]   Overnight, I was transformed from a guy begging people to answer his emails to someone on
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   the other side.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.840]   All kinds of requests and offers poured in, speaking gigs, interviews, consulting partnerships,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   brand deals.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   It was a tsunami.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.800]   Flattered, unprepared, and afraid this might be my only 15 minutes of fame, I said yes
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.680]   to nearly everything, especially anything six, nine, or 12 months off in the distance.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.200]   My calendar seemed like pristine water, clear as crystal for a brief lull, but then I had
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   to pay the piper.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.240]   All right, so I want to offer a metaphor for understanding sort of what's happening there,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   a common problem, and how we can get out of it.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.800]   I will say, by the way, Jesse, though, Ferris is underselling how successful his book was.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.080]   I've had many books hit the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.160]   That by itself doesn't create the tsunami.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.840]   It's like the right book and the right book at the right time.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.160]   The list is not the impressive part.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.520]   I think it was like that book was really successful, especially in Silicon Valley.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.280]   So I think people overvalue the New York Times bestseller list, but this book was very successful.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.260]   All right, so to make sense of the deeper lessons in Ferris' story, I'm going to introduce
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.240]   a metaphor here that we're going to follow through.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.760]   All right, so here's the metaphor.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.040]   Imagine a traveler, he's on an ocean liner, and the ocean liner sinks.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.060]   So before he dives into the water, the traveler instinctively grabs from his cabin all the
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.060]   things that seem important.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.840]   So like, hey, here's a tool I use for my work, or here's a gift that a friend gave me, or
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.360]   an instrument I play for entertainment, it's something that's important to me, and here's
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.320]   a book of poetry I'm trying to learn and better myself with this.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.980]   All this stuff that's important, he grabs it from his cabin before the ship sinks.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.340]   The problem is he has so much stuff that when he hits the water, he starts to flail.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.340]   He's taken in water.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.220]   His thrashing is only making things worse.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.240]   It's clear to him that he is drowning.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.520]   So if we connect this back to the Ferris story, this basically describes how Ferris is talking
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.620]   about that first year after the four-hour work week took off.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.060]   He had so many commitments that they were weighing him down.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.700]   He couldn't keep his head above water.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.500]   It was that sense of, I am drowning in things to do.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.140]   Okay, so then where things get interesting to me is the possible responses to this situation.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.760]   So if we return to the metaphor, here's one possible response.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.820]   Maybe our traveler is a high-achieving type A type, so before heading out on his ocean
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.280]   voyage, he was saying, "Look, I'm afraid about ship sinking, so I'm going to train to be
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.080]   comfortable in the water, and I'm going to train how to tread water, like what's the
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.200]   right stroke to use, and I'm going to exercise and get my legs strong, and I'm going to get
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.300]   my lungs strong, and I'm going to master how not to panic, and I can be in the water like
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.940]   a rescue swimmer would learn, like how to be comfortable in the water and staying afloat."
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.060]   So maybe our traveler does all that work.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.580]   So now when the ship sinks, he jumps in the water with these things that are important
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.580]   to him.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.540]   He's not flailing and drowning.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.060]   He's sort of calmly and strongly doing the efficient stroke, keeping his head above water.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.340]   But here's the creeping realization.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.100]   It's taking all of his energy just to stay in that spot.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.060]   He's not drowning right away, but he's also not getting anywhere.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.420]   He's just stuck right there where the ship sunk, and eventually, much more slowly than
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.620]   if he was not prepared at all, but eventually his strength will begin to ebb, and he knows
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.920]   eventually he can't stay here forever.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.380]   He will slip back below the water.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.740]   All right, if we connect back to the world of Ferris and productivity, to me, preparing
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.140]   and learning to tread water, to be good and comfortable in the water in our metaphor is
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.360]   like in Ferris' world, having good productivity and time management systems.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.140]   You're prepared to deal with lots of things.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.460]   You keep track of obligations, like I talk about.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.620]   You manage what you're going to do with your time.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.500]   I sometimes talk about this as having a how-and-when system or what-and-when system, rather.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.980]   You have a system to keep track of what you need to do and some way of figuring out when
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.600]   you're going to do things.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   This sort of happened.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.860]   Now I'm extrapolating beyond Ferris' excerpt to just things we know about him more generally.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.940]   I would say this is probably more or less what happened to Ferris a little bit longer
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.220]   in the years immediately following the Four-Hour Workweek coming out, is he is really good
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.420]   at systems.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.360]   I know from that period, and he's talked about in his books, his systems for helping to deal
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.540]   with all the things he had to do and manage his time got very sophisticated.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.700]   He had teams and people who would answer things and keep track of and had rules for when we're
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.460]   going to do this or that and what's going on with his calendar.
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.700]   I don't want to have the book travel.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.100]   I'll have someone who'd do that for me.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.900]   That's got really good at the treading water.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.040]   A lot of people in our audience also gets very good at that as well.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.240]   You have good systems in place so that you're not going to panic if you have a huge amount
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.900]   of stuff on your plate.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.660]   You'll be able to look at where things are, make sure this is on a waiting-to-hear-from
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.660]   list.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.660]   I've time-blocked this.
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.660]   I'm getting back at this.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.420]   You're keeping your head above water and you're staying calm, but you're not getting anywhere.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.620]   If we return to our metaphor, what's the final thing our traveler could do?
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:33.740]   Ultimately, the only answer that remains is that if he lets go of some of these things
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.860]   he's holding, these important things he brought in from the ship before it sunk, he'll be
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.780]   able to start swimming and now he can actually aim to where he wants to go, like the shore,
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.300]   and make progress towards there.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.140]   What he needs, ultimately, to get out of this situation is going to have to let some of
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.140]   those things go.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.060]   If we go back to Ferris's world, this is where he eventually evolved to.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.400]   Ferris eventually evolved to a place where he was much more comfortable having less proverbial
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.460]   important things on his body in the water.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:15.880]   He got good at saying no to obligations or commitments, some that were important to him,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.940]   some that were coming from friends, some that were very entertaining to him.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.020]   He got really good at that, which is why he's writing this whole book about saying no.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.220]   To give you one example, there's another excerpt from the book that's written by Neil Strauss,
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.700]   who I think is actually co-writing this book with Ferris.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.820]   But Strauss has this memory of more recently trying to context him, who he knows, with
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.820]   a text message.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.040]   When he texted him, he got the following response.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.940]   This is like an automated reply.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.500]   I'm traveling overseas until November 7th.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.700]   If your text is urgent, please reach out to someone on my team.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.640]   Otherwise, please resend your text after November 7th if it still applies.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.020]   Since catching up would be impossible, I'll be deleting all messages upon my return and
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.260]   starting from scratch.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.260]   Thank you.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.880]   As Strauss then says, this is a boss-level no.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.080]   So ultimately where Tim got was recognizing that the systems alone wouldn't save him.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.340]   He had to just have less things going on in his life.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:21.140]   So I like that metaphor because not only does it have the obvious message of eventually
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.020]   you have to say no to things if you're going to get where you're going to go, but there's
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.700]   a subtler message in there that Ferris' example emphasizes.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.820]   My own life emphasizes and struggles with this as well.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.740]   There's this subtle message in there, which I think is very important for us to understand
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.080]   overload in our current moment.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.620]   The traveler still had to learn to be comfortable in the water and didn't let go of things as
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.020]   well.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.800]   So if the traveler had skipped the getting comfortable in the water step, he wasn't going
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.460]   to make it to the shore even if he dropped all of his things.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.980]   And I think this is what's often missed when we're trying to understand or make sense of
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.540]   a critique productivity or time management organization.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.340]   It's not that these skills aren't important, but it's realizing, I think it's a frustration
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.060]   that a lot of type A people like myself have, is the skills by themselves cannot make every
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.000]   situation tractable.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.020]   You can be a really good swimmer, but if you have a bunch of stuff in your arms, you're
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.140]   eventually going to sink.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.140]   Same thing.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.140]   You can be super organized, but if you're trying to do too much, that overhead to actual
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.340]   execution ratio is going to get so high enough that nothing's going to get done.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.880]   It's going to be very frustrating.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.560]   You can keep your head above water for a while.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.300]   You can keep people from getting upset.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.220]   The most important things get done or deferred, and you sort of figure out how to make the
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.860]   whole puzzle work, but you're not making your way to shore.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.460]   What I think people miss is they want one without the other.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.660]   So the common mistake, the mistake that most people are coming to realize is like, okay,
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.320]   you can't just be really well organized if you're doing too much.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.980]   But the other mistake is made as well, where people are saying, the problem here is just
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.980]   the doing too much.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.900]   And that you shouldn't learn, if we go back to the metaphor, don't learn to swim because
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.020]   that might maybe encourage you to bring too many things with you.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:22.260]   It's better not to even bother with that swimming culture because we don't want people to think
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.940]   that they can swim their way out of overload.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.320]   But the problem is if you don't bother with that swimming culture, you can be as in as
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   you want.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   I'm not bringing anything with me.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.480]   I say no to everything, you're still going to drown.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.700]   So it's that you need both.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.460]   The traveler who survived was a traveler who both trained but also was willing to let go
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.060]   of things that were important.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.860]   And so I think that's often missed in the anti-productivity discussion.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.180]   It's the hardest part, I think, of the productivity discussion.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.780]   No organization is bad.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.500]   Only trusting organization is bad.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.620]   You need some organization, but you need all this other stuff as well.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.460]   And the other stuff is psychological.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.160]   Or if we read like Oliver Berkman stuff, philosophical.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.700]   There's all of these other layers to it.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.060]   But the layers have to add up on top of each other.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   They're not alternatives.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.700]   Like I care about productivity or I care about like being present and not doing too much.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.580]   You need both of these things have to work together.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.940]   So that metaphor or the difference between drowning, treading and swimming, I think it's
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.940]   helpful for me.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.940]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.660]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:35.120]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.540]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.900]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.720]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   Check it out.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.860]   So anyways, I'm looking forward to Tim's book because he really, really is good at saying
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.860]   no.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.500]   Because anyone who's communicated with him knows he's good at that.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.300]   And I think that is probably the hardest lesson or the most underserved lesson in these discussions
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   of productivity.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   I can teach you how to swim.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.060]   I'm good at that.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.180]   But even I need more help figuring out how to drop some of the stuff I'm carrying.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.180]   So I'm looking for that book.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.700]   And hopefully that metaphor proves as useful to you as it's starting to prove useful for
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700]   me as well.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.260]   Maybe it's a little overwrought, Jesse, but I like that idea.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.260]   Treading, swimming.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.900]   There's a lot of pieces in there.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.980]   I've listened to all of his podcasts for like over 10 years.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.500]   Do you think he has it all figured out?
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.420]   I think he's still trying to figure it out.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.180]   I think he has the not getting overloaded thing figured out.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.140]   Yeah, I don't know that he has life figured out, who among us does.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:52.180]   But his combination of systems plus he more so than anyone I know really does seem to
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.180]   follow these rules.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.860]   Like I don't want to extra stuff in my life, right?
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.900]   And like a clear example of that is the fact that his podcast is really not, it's remote
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.740]   and not video forward.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.660]   And he's just, you know, I think we talked about this when I went on his show last.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.840]   He's like, I know that's the trend.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.440]   I should build a studio and have people come to me and then we can film with like really
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.020]   good 4K cameras and have a really good video presence.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.260]   But he says, that's going to put too big of a footprint on my schedule.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.140]   I have to be where my studio is.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.420]   I have to fly people out to the studio.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.700]   I can't travel.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.780]   I can't go spend six weeks, you know, in Europe or whatever because I have to be at the studio.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.780]   We have to be recording it.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.100]   He says, I'm not going to do that.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.500]   I'm going to record using a headset that I can just pack in a bag and from like any room
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.700]   I am anywhere in the world, I can just put that on and record it, right?
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.000]   Like that's an example of someone following this.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.520]   It's an opportunity here.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.720]   Like no, I want to have like a Rogan style studio.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   Everyone's doing these studios.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.940]   It might make my audience bigger.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.880]   But his take was, I don't want the extra commitment.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   It's not worth it for me.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.040]   The podcast is successful enough.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.120]   I enjoy it.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.280]   I don't want to make it more of a burden.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.200]   So I think with things like that, I think that's someone actually walking the walk at
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.360]   least when it comes to not doing too much.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.880]   So I think he really got, that book, it's, it was a successful book.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.160]   Other people whose books were that successful, I don't think got the same degree of overload
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.840]   that he experienced in like 2007, 2008 because of who that book was successful with.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.680]   So that book was successful with this sort of younger Silicon Valley crowd who really
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.200]   kind of like obsessively latched on.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.440]   So I'm sure that was not easy, you know, like Deep Work was very successful, but I don't,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.640]   I did not have nearly that level.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.800]   I mean, I have a lot of things in my life that I have to say no to, and I have all these
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.680]   teams now, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.000]   But I didn't have that same sort of like obsessive focus that I think for whatever reasons Tim's
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.240]   book generated.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.200]   I wonder if he'll keep his podcast going because he kind of alluded to the fact that he doesn't
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   know what he's going to do.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.720]   He's been down for a while, right?
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.080]   He had like the 10 year anniversary or something.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   That's right.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   We all wrote something for him.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   Good question.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   Good question.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   All right.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   Anyways, look forward to that book.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   We got questions to handle here.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.960]   I'm looking forward to, but first I want to talk about one of our sponsors.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.760]   If you're going online without ExpressVPN, this is like leaving your laptop unattended
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.400]   at the coffee shop while you run to the bathroom.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   Most of the time you're probably fine.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.560]   But what if one day you come back out of the bathroom and your laptop is gone?
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.440]   Every time you connect to an unencrypted network, like in a cafe or hotel or an airport, your
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.860]   online data is not secure.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.800]   Any hacker on the same network can gain access and steal your personal data.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:49.060]   You need a VPN to protect you, and the VPN I recommend is ExpressVPN.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:56.040]   Even if you feel like you're using a secure protocol, hey, I'm encrypting the data I'm
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:01.480]   sending or what have you, the headers in your packets are clearly readable, and anyone nearby
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.840]   can see what sites you're talking about, what services you're using.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.440]   Even if you're at home and your home is in the middle of nowhere, your internet service
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.600]   provider can say, "Ah, I know what sites or services you're accessing."
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.560]   The VPN keeps your data and your activities private.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.520]   The way it does it is it simply, you tell the VPN who you want to talk to, it encrypts
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.640]   that request, sends it to a VPN server, the VPN server unencrypts it and then talks to
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.280]   the site and service on your behalf, it encrypts the response and sends it back to you.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.860]   All the people who are watching you see is you sending messages back and forth to a VPN
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.860]   server.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.920]   They don't know what site and service you're talking to on the other end, and that's how
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.600]   you get your privacy.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.960]   ExpressVPN makes this easy to do.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   It's super secure.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.880]   It would take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past their encryption.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.600]   You can set it up by you just click the app, one button and things, the protection turns
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.860]   on and then you just use your sites, your web browser apps like before.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.820]   It works on all devices, phones, laptops, tablets, and more, so you can stay secure
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.820]   on the go.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:08.480]   It is rated number one by top tech reviewers like CNET and The Verge.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.960]   For me, I particularly care about ExpressVPN protection when I'm on the road.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   I really don't trust Wi-Fi routers on the road.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.800]   It's not just that people nearby could be sniffing them, it's like I don't know if this
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.720]   is a real router or not.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.520]   Maybe someone set up like a fake router so they can really gather all the packets being
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.480]   sent and I know if I'm using ExpressVPN, I'm completely fine.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.060]   Set up all the fake routers in the world, all you know is I'm talking to a VPN server.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:42.240]   The other place, I haven't traveled to Europe as much recently, but this was a big hack.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.200]   When I traveled to Europe and I wanted to access like a streaming service back in the
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.960]   States or something, I'm in a hotel in Europe somewhere, I would ExpressVPN to a server
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.160]   in the U.S. and then as far as like Netflix was concerned, I was in the U.S. and I could
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.120]   access my sort of the show I was watching before I traveled.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.760]   So I've always liked it for that as well.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.920]   Secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-v-a-p-n.com/deep and you'll get an extra four months for free,
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.640]   but only when you go to expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   I also want to talk about our friends, the Defender line of vehicles.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.160]   We have the 90, the 110, and the 130 just seating up to eight.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.760]   Last time we talked about the Defender, I alluded to a good friend of the show, Brad
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:44.920]   Stolberg had sent me a picture of a all black Defender that he saw down in Miami doing a
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.520]   talk down there and he's like, "When are we going to get our Defender and travel the country
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520]   podcasting?"
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.760]   I was like, "That is the right car.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.680]   That is going to be our podcasting car."
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.080]   You got to check out what these things look like.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.720]   Go to LandRoverUSA.com.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.560]   It's a very slick looking car and it's, you know, when Brad and I go through with our
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:05.160]   plan of traveling the country podcasting remotely, we've decided that's the car we want to take.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.800]   Look, it's a icon.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   I like that about it.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.960]   It's an iconic vehicle that's been re-imagined through thoroughly modern design, so you still
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.720]   have that iconic look, you have those legendary capabilities off-road and on, but also all
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.640]   the modern tech you would want in a modern state-of-the-art vehicle, like their 3D surround
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:34.080]   cameras, their ClearSight rear view gives you a rear view you can see even if you have like
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.720]   a bunch of podcasting equipment in the back of your car and you can't actually see out
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   the window.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.840]   Their PVPro infotainment system is excellent.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.360]   Anyways, it's a cool car.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:50.880]   It's a classic car, or I should say vehicle, it's not a car, it's a SUV maybe, iconic,
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.000]   but also quite luxurious, right?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.880]   So Jesse, beware because when Brad and I are going to travel the country podcasting, you're
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.640]   going to be sitting in the middle seat moving the video switcher.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.240]   I was going to say I won't be able to keep up with my truck.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.080]   The one that Brad sent me a picture of had a nice, because it was tricked out, they had
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.240]   a nice roof rack on there.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.200]   So you're going to be on the roof, we'll strap you down, it'll be okay, but you'll be up
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.640]   on the roof doing the video switcher as we go down the highway recording our Defender
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   podcast.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.000]   You can design your Defender at LandRoverUSA.com, go to LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   the Defender.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.760]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.680]   First question's from Antonio.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.640]   You discussed that a major impact of AI is that non-experts will be able to use tools
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   at expert level without the training and this leads to productivity gains.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.840]   Don't you think this can also lead to quality productivity loss?
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.120]   If a user is relying heavily on AI for analysis, the work can have fundamental flaws that the
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.400]   non-expert won't be able to fix?
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.160]   I mean, maybe, but I think there's a bit of a difference in the model that we're thinking
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.960]   about about how one would interact with AI in this scenario.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:11.600]   I think the last few years we've been attuned to this chatbot model where the AI is this
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.960]   sort of singular self-contained intelligence that you're asking to do things on your behalf.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.880]   So I think that's what you have in mind, like I'm asking the AI, "Analyze this data and
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.320]   tell me what you see," and then you don't really know what results it's going to produce.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.080]   No, I see it actually much more instrumental than that.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:33.120]   It's allowing you to do something in a piece of software that you know what it is, you
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.760]   just don't know what is the right way to click on things or select things to actually make
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.480]   this happen.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.600]   This is where I think the first impact is going to be.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.080]   So you're going to be in Microsoft Excel and you have all these columns of data, and you
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   know what you want to do.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.920]   Maybe what you want to do is like, "Okay, can we take out every row where the amount
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.120]   in column C, which is dollar amounts, is below $100, erase all those rows, and then I want
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:06.960]   to sort all the rows that remain based on their column F, which is like the location."
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.280]   And you're like, "I don't really know exactly how to, or that's going to take me a second
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.200]   to do, or I don't know how to sort, but I know what I want it to do.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.720]   I could just sort of say that and then some sort of copilot type plugin will do that work
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.600]   for me."
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.400]   Or you're in Word and you want to say something like, "I don't really know how this feature
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:33.720]   works, but can we go through and get rid of the, turn off the initial paragraph indents?
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.460]   Like when you start a new paragraph in a dense, I actually don't like that.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.440]   Can you turn off those indents?
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.040]   And then can we make the block quotes where I have a quote, can we make the vertical spacing?
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   It's like double space.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   Can we make that single space?"
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.800]   Again, you know what you want to do, it's just like, "I haven't learned, where do I
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.300]   find these formatting things?
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.980]   Where do I go to change it?"
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.280]   It's going to be things like that.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.520]   You sort of know what you want to do, but you don't know how to do it.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.040]   You haven't had that training.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.520]   And so it's like someone sitting with you, like used to be your nephew would sit with
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.040]   you when you're using your computer and they would, "Okay, I know how to do that, grandad.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   Here's how it goes."
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   Right?
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.980]   That's what I'm imagining the initial productivity gains are going to be.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.120]   Not as the paradigm we've been trained in the last couple of years to get used to, which
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.720]   is more, "Hey, you singular intelligent entity, I'm going to give you something and you're
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.920]   going to go off and think and come back and bring me something."
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:32.840]   I actually used AI semi-successfully, Jesse, on the deep dive.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:38.560]   I had written it, the metaphor in the deep dive, using the second person, you.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.120]   And I was like, "I think this would be better as a traveler, like a third person."
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.680]   So I asked ChatGPT, I was like, "Can you rewrite it that way?"
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   And it did.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.480]   And I had to adjust some things.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.980]   I don't know that it really saved me that much time.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.120]   But it's an example, I knew what I wanted it to do and it saved me a little bit of time
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.680]   with me trying to do it.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.840]   I mentioned this to you before, but I was listening to the Ferris Seth Godin one and
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.560]   they were talking about perplexity and Claude, which I never used.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.600]   But then I started using them and it's pretty awesome.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   I like perplexity.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   I use perplexity sometimes too.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   It's good for-
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.920]   So you pay for it?
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.480]   I just use it free, I guess.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.720]   I could only add the option to pay for it, but I paid for it for the year, it was like
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   $200.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.240]   Maybe I'm paying for it.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.680]   It's useful.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.960]   It's still only marginally useful over Google.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.000]   And that's because we forget how much artificial intelligence is already in Google.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.200]   Google's pretty good at, "Hey, I need an example of this," or "What's this?"
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.960]   It'll just kind of find you those pages or give you short answers to things, which works
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.720]   pretty well.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.760]   Perplexity will summarize it in its own words and give you the links to follow.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.120]   I find it to be marginally better than Google for certain things.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.800]   Also, it makes things up a lot that does get in the way.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.640]   If you ask it for examples, it'll find you this perfect example that's not right.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.980]   It's changed it to be exactly what you're looking for, and then you follow the source
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.880]   and it's not at all what it's saying.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.320]   The example was the other day, I was looking for one of my New Yorker pieces from last
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   month.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.500]   I was looking for an example of a parent, I forgot the exact details, but a parent testifying
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:23.920]   in Congress about the negative impacts of social media on their kids, some testimony.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.320]   I asked Perplexity about it, and it was like, "Yep, there's a famous case.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.520]   It's a tragic case of this young girl who I think committed suicide, and there's a lawsuit
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   after that."
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.720]   They sued Meta, and Perplexity's like, "Yeah, the mom, and here's her name, came before
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.760]   the such and such committee in Congress.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.680]   Here's some quotes from her testimony," and I was like, "Oh, that's just perfect.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.280]   Let me just, you know, it's a New Yorker, I need a fact check.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.920]   Let me find the actual source to make sure I'm quoting this right."
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   Never happened.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   Never happened.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   Really?
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   She never testified.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.280]   And I asked Perplexity about this, and then finally it was like, "Yeah, I might have made
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   that up basically."
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.400]   You're right, I can't actually find a real source that confirms that.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.960]   So it fed me exactly what I needed, but it didn't exist, which is interesting.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   That's incredible.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.400]   I mean, the name of the committee, well, it turns out it was just, because I know all
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.680]   this stuff about this particular topic, it was mixing sources about Frances Hogan, the
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:28.000]   Facebook whistleblower, her testimony in Congress with this parent of the kid who was suing
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.320]   Meta, and it mixed those two things together and made like the parent testifying in front
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   of Congress.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   It was interesting.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   All that got cut anyways.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   All right.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.700]   What do we got next?
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.560]   Interesting questions from Natasha.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.480]   What counts as non-optimal technology for the digital declutter?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.520]   You gave an example on a participant only listening to podcasts during his commute.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.200]   I feel like I spend too long listening to podcasts throughout the day, so I'm considering
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.080]   completely banning them for the 30-day duration to explore other hobbies and reassess things.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.760]   So the digital declutter, which is from my book, Digital Minimalism, it has you go 30
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.840]   days without using what's called optional digital technologies.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.680]   So I threw optional in there to make it clear this is not you getting out of like answering
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.760]   your work emails.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.200]   If your kid uses text message to tell you when they're ready to be picked up from practice,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.160]   you need to still use text messages, right?
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:29.400]   But the stuff that feels optional, you take it out of your life for 30 days, you aggressively
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.600]   work on reflection and experimentation to figure out what really matters, and then in
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.000]   the end, you figure out what you want to let back.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.520]   So Natasha's question is like, how do we draw this line about what is an optional technology
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.960]   or not?
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.440]   And I basically say, trust your gut, right?
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:48.520]   So she's pointing out, I gave the example in the book, of maybe you listen to podcasts
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.880]   still during your digital declutter, but you don't do social media.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.480]   And she's saying, well, what if I don't want to do podcasts?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   And I would say, yeah, then don't do them.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.400]   But you're kind of trusting your gut here.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.920]   What you're looking for is information, information both about what really matters, and you will
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.840]   get that if and when you've taken a lot of things out of your life and you're more aggressively
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:16.120]   reflecting and experimenting with other analog activities, and information about what you
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.440]   really miss or not.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.200]   And so taking a lot of things out of your life will help you get that information.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.100]   So it's not so important to me that you get the exact list, but that you're being honest
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.360]   about it.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.760]   The stuff that troubles you, you're moving out.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.200]   The other option you have, and I talk about this in the book, is you could leave some
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.080]   things that you need to use to some degree and put fences around it to reduce it.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.200]   And I think that's probably how I was talking about podcasts.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.760]   I think I was probably saying, maybe you put fences around it.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.360]   So you're like, well, I'll still listen to the podcast on my commute.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.480]   That's what I do in my commutes, but I'm not going to listen to them otherwise.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   I have this with streaming video, right?
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.680]   A lot of people, when I did this experiment with a lot of people doing a digital declutter,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:03.560]   multiple people said, oh, here was my fence around Netflix-style streaming services.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.640]   I'm allowed to watch during the declutter if there's someone else with me.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.400]   So I could still do social watching.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.240]   Me and my roommate are going to watch a movie because that seems not like a problem, but
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   I can't do binging.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.820]   I want to try to take a break from binging.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.560]   So you can either take things out or you can put fences around them.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.360]   There is no hard and fast line about what has to be there, what doesn't have to be there.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.680]   But you got to trust your gut.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.440]   I mean, if something is worrying you how much you're using it, then take it out for the
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.320]   digital declutter or have fences around it.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.400]   But the key thing about the declutter, it's like the key point of that book.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.600]   You have to spend the time, when you're taking the break, you have to spend that time aggressively
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.440]   pursuing alternative activities that are valuable to you.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.440]   That is where the value is.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.700]   If you just try to white knuckle the digital declutter, if you try to say, I'm just going
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.200]   to stop using all this stuff on my phone because I don't like it, I'm just going to do that
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.360]   for 30 days, you're not going to make it.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.320]   You're going to be staring into the void and it's going to drive you insane.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.440]   You have to be aggressively pursuing the alternatives to fill the time.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.360]   That's what makes something like the digital declutter actually work.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.480]   And it's why I call it a declutter and not a detox, because the detox terminology in
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.460]   the context of digital technology is too much use as this idea of taking a break.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.800]   If you could just get away from things, you can clarify yourself and then go back to using
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.600]   your stuff just the way you were before.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.840]   I don't like that detox mindset in the realm of digital.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.080]   I prefer the declutter because the goal of this process is at the end to only add back
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.360]   to stuff that matters.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.000]   Your goal with this process is to have a different declutter digital life on the other side,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.920]   not just taking a break from your digital life and then returning to it unchanged on
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.160]   the other side.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   That detox thing is good to me.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.800]   I mean, it's also not the right use of the word detox.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.560]   I mean, in substance abuse treatment, detox, yes, you're kind of getting something out
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.960]   of your system, but you don't go back to it.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.020]   You don't detox from alcohol and then go back to drinking.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.800]   It's the first step towards sobriety.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.640]   So it's weird the way the digital world has, digital wellness has taken detox to now just
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.320]   mean like a temporary break.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:19.080]   Like if I could just get some breathing room from social media, that'll be helpful.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.520]   And then I'll just go back to using social media again on the other end.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.640]   Never made sense to me.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.560]   On the new White Lotus on Macs, they call it a detox when they go to Thailand and they're
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.000]   like introducing the guests and stuff.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I need your phones.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I watched it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.800]   And that is using detox in like the digital wellness way, which is like take a break while
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.320]   you're in Thailand for a week.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   I just saw it last night.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.320]   I was thinking of this.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   I know.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   We watched it too.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   You watched it too.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   All right.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   All right.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.320]   Next question's from Ethan.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.960]   "Can you be in a state of deep work even if your cognitive capabilities aren't being pushed
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.000]   to the limit and not improving a skill?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.640]   For example, reading a book?"
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.320]   Well, I mean, deep work is a term that was introduced in the context of professional
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   activities.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.840]   So it was very specifically talking about professional activities where you're doing
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.880]   something hard, like something you'd been trained for, and you're doing it with your
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.200]   full focus.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:12.280]   And the whole point of identifying that professional activity in that book was to say, don't forget
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.600]   this is really the thing that most moves the needle in most organizations.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.620]   This is the thing that ultimately produces the valuable things that lets you keep your
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.680]   lights on.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:28.600]   So don't be seduced into having everyone's day be spent doing the shallow instead, just
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.040]   on email, just in movies.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:38.320]   Don't let that meetings, don't let that busyness somehow in your mind make you feel like you're
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.160]   hustling or running a sharp organization.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.720]   It's the focus stuff on things that's not easy to do that ultimately produces the value.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.200]   That's the hard to replicate stuff.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.000]   So we shouldn't forget that being important.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.880]   So it's really talking about professional activities.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.640]   I think the notion of deep work for a lot of people has taken on this sort of moral
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640]   valence.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.120]   It's like good activities versus bad activities, which I don't think is right.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.360]   I mean, even in the work context, it's not like the non-deep activities are bad.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:12.240]   I mean, the non-deep work activities include sending the invoices that is going to get
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.520]   you the money for the thing that you created.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.780]   I mean, it's going to be booking the travel that allows you to go present the lecture
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.920]   that's based off of a lot of deep thinking.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   It's not bad.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.880]   My point is, though, work can't just be that.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.720]   You can't let it crowd out the thing that's actually producing the value.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.320]   But anyways, there's this moral valence people take to it.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.800]   And then this sort of makes people upset because then they feel like they're being accused,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.080]   that if they're not doing enough of this, that it's somehow bad.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.280]   And then it captures, once you have a moral valence, you begin to use this term to talk
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.480]   about non-professional activities, like in your life outside of work, and deep means
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.760]   good and shallow means bad.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   And you're like, well, reading a book seems like it's a good activity, so can't I call
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   that deep work?
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   And I'm saying, no, no.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   This is a narrow concept.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.280]   It has to do with professional activities in professional settings, in particular, knowledge
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.840]   work settings.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.520]   Reading a book is what I would call a focused activity, right?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.840]   It has that element that is a part of deep work in which you're giving something your
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.120]   full attention.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.440]   I do think focused activities are useful.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.580]   Your life should have them.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.880]   Our mind expects them.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.740]   It can be very stressful and ultimately sort of deranging to have no focused activities
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.740]   in your life.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:32.600]   I mean, if you're constantly on a phone and your mind can never just do one thing, that
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.760]   is a problem.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   You're going to exhaust your mind.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.720]   I talk about this in digital minimalism.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.640]   Your mind needs what I call solitude, but freedom from input for other minds, and focused
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.760]   activities like reading a book give you that.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.680]   So is working on like a woodworking project.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.760]   It might not be in the moment what you're doing, which might be like sanding, is not
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.520]   cognitively demanding, but it's a focused activity.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.240]   It's getting your full attention or you're knitting.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.260]   It's not a hard stitch, but it's taking your full attention.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.160]   Focused activities are great, but I would use that terminology different than deep work.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:08.760]   Deep work is a very specific, knowledge work specific, professional pursuit activity.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.380]   Focused work is more broad.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.600]   You do need focused activities.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.920]   Reading a book is a great focused activity for a lot of reasons, but I wouldn't mix that
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.080]   up with the terminology for deep work because deep work is trying to do something very specific,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.760]   which has to be how do we design and think about running knowledge work organizations
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.800]   and how are we messing that up in the digital age.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.640]   It's that moral issue, Jesse, that's what I get surprised or I would get surprised when
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.720]   people would get upset about deep work, but they get upset almost always as a consequence
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.640]   of first interpreting deep work with this moral valence, and then as soon as you start
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.700]   thinking like deep work is good, other work is bad, and whoever does more deep work is
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.340]   better than someone who does less, then people start to get upset because they say, "Well,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.340]   wait a second.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.920]   There's different jobs and different people have more opportunities to do deep work than
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.840]   other people and why are people judging me," and it opens up this whole can of worms.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:07.000]   I just see it as a specific activity, among others, that's done in a knowledge work organization
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.320]   that has been receiving, it's been forgotten or it was being forgotten because high-tech
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.760]   tools were crowding out the attention space and it was just pointing out, "Don't forget
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   that."
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.680]   That's actually the thing that keeps the lights on.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.120]   We might have to go out of our way to protect it these days because of the velocity of distraction
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.200]   coming from things like digital tools.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.560]   So I like that distinction.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.960]   Focused activities is a broad category.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.380]   Reading books is in there, knitting's in there, sanding wood is in there.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:42.300]   Deep work is under that umbrella, along with other things, like sports or flow activities
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.440]   can be under that umbrella, too, but they're all under that umbrella.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.080]   So I think that's a useful distinction.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.560]   All right, who do we got?
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.800]   Jeff, what are Cal's thoughts regarding content aggregator services such as InnoReader, which
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.920]   allow you to subscribe to and view content such as blog posts, YouTube videos, and social
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.880]   media channels outside the original platforms?
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.280]   Is this a good way to be more intentional about content consumption, or is it just another
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   distraction?
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:17.440]   Well, I'm a huge booster of aggregators as a way of reclaiming some of the value proposition
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   of the original internet.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:25.080]   I don't really get the point of aggregators that are aimed at algorithmic platforms, however.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.560]   The whole point of an algorithmic platform, like a social media platform, their whole
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.640]   point was to push back against the aggregation model.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.760]   When I first got started in new media, I got started with a blog.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.120]   This would have been back in 2007.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:46.640]   I loved that time period because it was individuals producing their own content on their own servers,
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:51.280]   and what people would do is have a RSS reader, so a reader that could read the automated
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.480]   feeds that would describe when you had new blog posts.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.380]   You would have an RSS reader that would go around and check for all the blogs you subscribe
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.760]   to, and subscribing was just like you telling the reader, "This is a blog I want to follow,"
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.800]   and it would just check, "Hey, is there a new post on this blog?
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   If so, I'll pull it into the reader so you can read it right there next to any other
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   blog post."
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.600]   And your reader would just have, like, "Here's the newest articles from around the blogs
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.480]   you follow," and you had one tool you would read.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.680]   I still have memories of—I don't know what tool it was.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   Google had a good reader.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   Maybe it was Google's.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.160]   But being in a classroom—this might have been distributed algorithms I was TAing—and
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:40.520]   I remember reading Leo Babouda's Zen Habits post in my RSS reader in 2007 or 2006 or something
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.600]   like this.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.640]   That was a great technology.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   They got rid of it.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.480]   Google stopped supporting that, and other companies that were trying to do this went
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   out of business.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   Why?
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.980]   Because this was a bad model for trying to create a giant company.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.680]   It was a great model for consumers.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.200]   I could subscribe to these different sources of information I like, and they'll all show
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.260]   up in one app, so I just have to open up this one app or website—it was websites mainly
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.760]   back then—and it'll just tell me if there's a new thing over on Cal's blog.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.120]   It'll just show up, and I can just read it.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.480]   It's like my own personal newspaper.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.720]   That was fantastic.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:19.840]   But you can't make money on that if you're the company, because their content is being
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.120]   pulled from people's individual sites, and they're being brought to an individual to
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   read.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.440]   So the social companies were like, "No, no, no.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.680]   We need you to live on our walled garden platform.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:37.000]   We own all the content, and we'll use algorithms to give you a feed of things to read, and
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.060]   then we control all the content you see.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.380]   We can monitor all the behavior you do, and we can sell you targeted advertisements."
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.000]   So RSS went out of fashion, because they said, "You don't want an RSS feed.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.680]   You want a Twitter feed or a Facebook feed or an Instagram feed that's much more profitable
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.740]   for the small number of investors who are early in those companies."
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:05.080]   There's a return to the aggregator model, notably podcast listeners, podcast apps.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.840]   Podcast apps are basically blog RSS readers, right?
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:16.760]   If you go to Apple Podcasts, this is not like an Apple app, and all this data is in Apple's
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   world.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.440]   It's not like going on to Instagram.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.400]   All a podcast listening app does is you say, "I want to subscribe to Deep Questions."
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:33.360]   Just like in the days of blogs, it just goes and notes to itself, "Keep an eye on the RSS
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.360]   feed for Cal's podcast."
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.440]   Our podcast is just on a server somewhere.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.440]   It's nothing fancy.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.240]   It's not owned by some platform.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.080]   Just like a blog, it has an RSS feed that updates every time there's a new episode,
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.200]   and it has all the information, the metadata for the information, and a pointer to where
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.760]   the MP3 file is on the server.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.280]   Your podcast listener, once you say, "I care about Deep Questions," it just kind of pulls
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   that a bunch.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   "Hey, is there anything new?
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.280]   Is there anything new?"
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.120]   If it sees something new, it downloads that file off of the server that we just happened
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.320]   to store our podcast on, and you can access it from your listener.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:09.800]   Podcasting actually is a return to blog RSS readers, and I think it's fantastic.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.720]   The content's independent.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   We own our own content.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:20.080]   It's on our own servers, and anyone with any type of podcast app can subscribe and listen
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.480]   to our content, or you can even go to the deeplife.com/listen and just listen to it
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   right there.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.520]   I think that's really cool.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.220]   I would like to see a return for it.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.800]   What I think that the technology is interesting to me now is aggregators for email newsletters.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.160]   I think that's going to be the blog reader of 2026.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.120]   It's going to be like what blog readers were in 2006.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.600]   That's what I'm looking for, because email inboxes are crowded.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.800]   You have personal stuff.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   You have work stuff.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   You have urgent stuff.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.920]   The context shifting is immense.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   You have spam.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.560]   You have promotional stuff.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.800]   It's a very crowded attention arena.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.000]   I know some of these tools exist, and listeners, feel free to write to jesse@calnewport.com
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.160]   if you have good ones to point out to me, but I think these tools are going to evolve
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.160]   to be really important.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.520]   Substack is trying to do this just for Substack blogs, but I want there to be independent
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.760]   apps where you just tell it, and I know there's a couple like this where they actually give
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.640]   you an email address you use to subscribe to the newsletter, so it comes straight to
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   it.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.680]   I want there to be a way that all my email newsletters, I just have one app or website
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.480]   I go to, and it's just like a newspaper except for what you're seeing is what's coming from
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   these email newsletters.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.200]   I don't want it to be Substack's app because that has lots of other stuff going on.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.960]   I don't want it following me and giving me algorithmic recommendations and trying to
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   keep me in there.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.080]   I just want it to be the things I subscribe to, it's showing it to me, and I can read
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.840]   them all there, and I don't have to go into my inbox that has other distracting things
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   to read them.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.200]   I think that's going to be, this decade, what blogs were.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.520]   It's going to be a way that you can have this content experience that's non-algorithmic
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.520]   and independent.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.000]   I'm a big believer in aggregators.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.840]   I don't believe in aggregators for giant social media platforms because their whole point
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.280]   was to try to destroy aggregators in the first place.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.880]   So then those emails would get deleted from your email account, right?
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.840]   They would just go right to the whatever the solution is.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.960]   Yeah, so I would be happy with that.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   Just have like a-
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   So then you would never see them.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   That would be pretty sweet.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   Yeah, just have an app, right?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.760]   Like here's the latest from like the different things you subscribe to.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.040]   Oh, hey, can I see like the archive of this one?
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   Here's the older articles, right?
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   I mean, I think it'd be cool.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:29.840]   Like a podcast app, I mean, why don't we just integrate these two things?
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.360]   That'd be a cool app.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.160]   It's like, oh, I like this person I subscribe.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.640]   It's like, oh, here's something to read.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.800]   Here's something to listen to.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.440]   The whole thing could look like the New York Times app or something like that.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.920]   Like people who have newsletters or podcasts, you can just have them.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.480]   Here's the newest stuff and you just listen to it and you have like a nice app and it
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   keeps track of where you are.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.380]   To be quite honest, I like the Washington Post app a lot better than the New York Times
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.000]   because you can still see the physical paper in the post.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.960]   I haven't tried that app.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.680]   I subscribe, but okay, I should try it.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.120]   Check it out.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.240]   The Times app is pretty good.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.200]   I don't like it because you can't see the paper.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   So what do you mean?
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.400]   Like it won't show you like what the actual paper looks like?
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   At least in the post, you have two options.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.320]   You can see the feed like it is in New York Times, but you can also go to the print edition
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   and you can see.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.320]   I like that.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.960]   You can do that with the Boston Globe too, but for some reason you can't do it with the
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   Times.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   Even at the same company.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   All right.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   What do we got next?
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.080]   We have our Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.400]   Ooh, this is where we have a question each week that relates to my book, Slow Productivity,
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.320]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.240]   It's also our excuse to play the Slow Productivity Corner theme music, which we'll hear right
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.240]   now.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   All right.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:47.720]   What do we got, Jesse?
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   It's from Jacob.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.080]   "I'm a senior executive looking after sales and marketing teams for a medium to large
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.320]   size business in New Zealand.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.240]   With a large team and ever-changing demands in a competitive retail environment, is it
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.560]   possible to avoid pseudo productivity and busyness?
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.620]   Time blocking is very difficult with constant disruptions, both in person and via other
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:07.620]   channels."
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:13.300]   Well, I see sort of two unrelated issues here.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.440]   Can you avoid pseudo productivity and business and busyness in a competitive retail environment?
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:24.680]   And then second, can time blocking somehow by itself help you accomplish this goal?
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   Answer the first part, yes.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.800]   I mean, think about it.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.940]   What is pseudo productivity?
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.200]   This is the core definition of my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.340]   It's the thing that slow productivity is trying to solve.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.520]   Pseudo productivity is the belief that visible activity is a reasonable proxy for useful
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   effort.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.680]   So busyness is the point.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   If you're busy, that's good.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.000]   If you're less busy, you're not.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.640]   The embrace of pseudo productivity as your primary metric for actually doing things useful
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.440]   is what leads to these sort of hyper-distractive environments where we're all hustling and
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.920]   getting after it and jumping off and on in calls and slack.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.000]   And we figure if we're really, really busy, we must be doing something right.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.460]   But it's also self-evident after just a little bit of reflection that pseudo productivity
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.680]   doesn't translate or correlate well with actual value produced.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.160]   If anything, it can make it worse.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.960]   If all you're doing is trying to be busy, where is it that you're actually allowing
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.880]   your mind to fix on a single cognitive context and apply your hard-won skills to produce
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.840]   some sort of new value, some new information that has value?
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.580]   Where are you doing the actual work of producing value in knowledge work?
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.980]   It's like running a car factory where you're constantly running around and having meetings
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.360]   about the quality management and the best way to produce cars, and you're constantly
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.340]   going around and making sure that the machines are oiled and putting in place new techniques
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.880]   to oil the machines and making sure that everything is working right and talking to people, "Hey,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.880]   what about this?
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.880]   What's going through your machine?"
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   But no one's actually building the cars.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.260]   You're all very busy, but eventually that plant's going to go out of business.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:53.200]   So no, pseudo productivity self-evidently is something you can get away from.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   How you do it is hard.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.360]   That's why I wrote a whole book about it.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.280]   Time blocking, that's like an individual time management strategy.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.520]   I don't see how that's going to break a culture of pseudo productivity among an entire team.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.760]   So what sort of things do matter?
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.920]   Here's some greatest hits from the book.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:18.040]   First of all, make the work that needs to be done transparent and external.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.560]   Do not just have tasks exist implicitly on people's plates that are being just passed
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.600]   around through emails and requests.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.040]   Have a Kanban-style board somewhere the whole team can see.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.560]   Here's things we need to do.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.240]   Here's things that are being done now and who is working on them.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.240]   So you can see, like immediately, this person's already working on three things.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.520]   I'm not going to give them a fourth.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:41.480]   Have some sort of systematic collaborative way of deciding how to update these assignments.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.280]   All right, what should we be working on next?
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   Who has capacity?
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.600]   Okay, you have capacity.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.040]   I'm going to move this card virtually or physically onto your column.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.360]   What do you need from other people to get this done?
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.400]   Let's just talk about this now while we're all here.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.440]   And so now you're keeping track of workload, you're preventing people from having too much
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.040]   on their plate at the same time, and you're getting much more efficient collaboration
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.480]   because you can front-load the decisions about who needs what from whom as opposed to having
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.880]   that sort of be dragged out in a distributed fashion with just emails that are being sent
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.800]   back and forth.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.760]   Work with things, alternatives to ad hoc messaging.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.600]   So maybe you have office hours for individuals.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.240]   If I have a question for you that you can't answer with a single message, I will go to
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.480]   your office hours and we'll have a five-minute discussion.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.400]   Me talking with five people during a one-hour office hours can prevent 50 messages that
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.520]   I have to receive and respond to throughout the rest of the day, which is a much bigger
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.520]   burden.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.900]   Your team, in addition to keeping track of your external tasks, consider having things
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.000]   like docket-clearing meetings twice a week.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   We get together.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.760]   This could be in smaller units.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.800]   We have a shared document where up to that point, if anything came up that we need to
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.360]   figure out as a team or someone needs to tackle or have a question about, I add it to that
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.080]   shared document called a docket, and in the docket-clearing meeting, we go down that list
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   one after another.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   All right.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   Do we really need to do this?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   Who's going to do this?
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.080]   What do you need?
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   What about this?
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.080]   Maybe we'll move this onto our list.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   We're going to wait to do this.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   What about this issue here?
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   Who has the answer for it?
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.560]   So you're consolidating when things get done, and you're using the docket to ensure that
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.640]   things will be remembered without doing what most people do to try to remember something
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.600]   that occurs to them is they send off an email, and it gets sent out there to start bouncing
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.000]   back and forth between people doing obligation, hot potato.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.640]   So have office hours, have docket-clearing meetings, be super clear about the metrics
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   that matter.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   Here's the things we produce.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   How much are we producing?
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   How good is it?
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   What did you contribute to it?
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:41.120]   The clearer you are in actual value, the less entranced you'll be by the simulated value
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   of pseudo productivity, so that's going to matter as well.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.520]   An idea from my book, A World Without Email, when it comes to external communication, people
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.480]   talking to your team from the outside, clients or other units within your organization, have
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   communication protocols.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.040]   You want to talk to us about this?
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   Here's how and when you do it.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.720]   It's not just you have someone's email address individually.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.480]   In fact, have communication channels that are disconnected from individuals.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.600]   That itself is a problematic paradigm, that all communication goes between handles that
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.000]   are associated with individuals.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.600]   No, I have an email address for client questions.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.040]   Now that changes the whole dynamic if you're a client, because when I'm sending this to
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:28.200]   Jesse, I'm just imagining there's another person in the office next door who I'm asking
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.120]   something and it's rude if they don't get back to me.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.240]   Why can't they just talk to me?
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.320]   I'm really mad at Jesse now because he didn't respond to me right away, but if I'm sending
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:40.680]   that question to clientquestions@company.com, I have a completely different set of expectations.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.440]   Like, oh, this is going into an information tracking system and I will get a response.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:48.280]   In fact, maybe there's some nice guidelines about, hey, here's how this works.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.080]   Send this to us.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.460]   This is emptied out and assigned to people to look at, like, once a day, you'll hear
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.760]   back within 48 hours.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.360]   And if it's not a person, that's reasonable.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   Process is a process.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.680]   If it's a person, we're like, why haven't I heard back in 20 minutes?
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.920]   So there's a lot of things you can do to begin reengineering a team away from pseudo productivity,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.320]   but it's not going to be like one simple hack or habit.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.680]   It's going to be a whole different way of keeping track of information, keeping track
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.600]   of tasks, communicating internally and communicating with the outside world.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   So read Slow Productivity in its entirety.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.800]   There's a lot of concrete advice in there.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.440]   Read A World Without Email, a lot of concrete advice in there about just the communication
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   piece.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.640]   This is possible, but it is really hard.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:34.200]   All right, let's, uh, what we got next, we have a call?
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   We do.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.200]   All right, let's see what we have today.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   Hi, Cal.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:43.640]   I have a bit of a silly and relatively simple, but not unimportant, I think, question.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.800]   I'm like many of us addicted to do scrolling.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.880]   I've gotten off Instagram for probably over a year, maybe closer to two years now.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.480]   But then YouTube brought out YouTube shorts, and then I would just infinitely scroll through
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   those.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.680]   And I realized that the solution to that was just taking it off my phone.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:07.520]   But I just feel like I always need to go to something that allows me to just scroll through
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.080]   my phone and turn off my brain for a few minutes at a time.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.440]   And the issue now is that I end up going on LinkedIn on my browser.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.320]   And the advantage of being wanting to do scroll on LinkedIn is that the content is quite boring
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:28.640]   and seeing a two week old post from someone with a cringy insight into life quickly makes
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.400]   you go off of it, but I still find myself going on it quite a few times each day.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.640]   Do you have any tips about how to get rid of this do scrolling reflex?
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.880]   I figure it's kind of like a smoker that just wants to fiddle with their hands or something.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.880]   Thanks.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:48.940]   Well, let's use the smoker analogy here for a second longer, right?
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:54.180]   So when a smoker who has just quit is trying to be successful, what is one of the key things
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.040]   you have to do?
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.600]   You have to get alternative activities, right?
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.160]   This is the key thing you have to teach a smoker.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:03.000]   Oh, this is a situation where you would normally smoke.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.160]   So what you need to do instead is like eat carrot sticks or you drink coffee, right?
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.360]   I mean, it's like the coffee at the AA meetings or whatever, right?
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:18.920]   You have to have alternative activities that fill the role, the thing that you are quitting
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.320]   used to play.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.040]   If you just white knuckle it, it's hard.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.600]   Like I'm used to smoking here and I just don't want to do it and I'm just going to hold my
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.240]   hand tight till my knuckles turn white.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.600]   You don't last very long that way.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.340]   You got to get the alternative activities.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.360]   The same holds, I think, for these information ecosystems.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.840]   Your problem is you need to train yourself to appreciate alternative types of stuff to
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:48.480]   do when you're bored that you like even better than the stale LinkedIn post, right?
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.240]   You're looking at the stale LinkedIn post like you must have nothing else pulling for
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   your attention.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.720]   So find other types of information and this is, it takes, you know, I talk about this
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.720]   in the digital declutter, it's experimentation and reflection.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.900]   So you try to figure out like what else is interesting to me and you put healthier habits
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:08.840]   in place and that sounds really simple, but it actually is what works.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.000]   It's simple because it's what works, it's what we do for all other sorts of addictions,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   it's what you need to do here as well.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.200]   There's a lot of things this could mean.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:22.600]   This could be analog, by the way, like retrain yourself to read fun books, right?
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.360]   Like if you're into thrillers, go get, now I'm going to do this, by the way, Jesse, go
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:36.120]   on to like a books and like, I'm going to get mass market paperbacks, you know, not
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.800]   first edition, so nothing expensive, of like thrillers from a given era.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.200]   Like I'm going to get the James Bond thrillers from like the original sort of whatever editions
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   those were.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:49.160]   They used to buy in the drugstore and they're sort of like portable paperbacks from the
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.040]   age where like there was no other distractions, I'm going to bring one of those with me and
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.840]   that's what I'm going to read when I'm bored and it's going to be stuff that's just super
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.320]   fun and I like it.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:02.480]   Or have sources of information online that is affirming and interesting and doesn't bring
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.520]   you into a bad place.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:10.120]   Like this time of year, especially like this year, like things are very grim where we live
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.520]   in Washington, D.C. because of all the disruptions to the federal workforce.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.800]   So like there's a lot of distraction and grimness.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.960]   What I like to, what I look at right now, what's helping me, baseball spring training.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.360]   Like I feel good.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.840]   I know so much.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:30.600]   I mean, I just know day to day like what is happening at West Palm Beach with the Nationals,
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:35.560]   like what exercise they did and how much do we really care about the quadricep tendonitis
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.400]   and James Wood and is it really, when is he going to get back to throwing activities,
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.760]   but what's his hitting doing?
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.720]   You know, I mean, how are, what is the workload for our new pitcher that we just brought in
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.360]   from the Japanese league who he's used to pitching seven days a week versus the five
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.440]   day a week rhythm that we have in the U.S.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.480]   And you know, Travis Soroka's changeup is looking really good.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:00.080]   To me, that's like really, I like that distraction, right?
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.800]   I like that distraction.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   I read a lot.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.800]   And I enjoy it.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.840]   I read and take notes on like idea books and I get really used to that.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.840]   It's like an alternative.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.880]   Maybe there's like podcasts.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.120]   I think podcasts can be super positive.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.640]   Like it's interesting, a formative podcast or interview podcast, you can kind of get
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.040]   lost in that.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.440]   Maybe it's some other sort of more hobby type activity.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.640]   Some people I know are really good at rabbit holing random topics.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.240]   I think that could be really interesting, right?
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:34.920]   Like I'm really in, I want to get really into vintage watches and they're like rabbit hole
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.440]   on a non-emotionally salient, non-algorithmically optimized content.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.400]   Like I'm on watch forums and I just love just finding nuggets of information about this
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:51.880]   thing I'm rabbit holing on, or I'm just really into right now the sprinter vans that get
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.840]   converted into these cool adventure bands.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:57.960]   I just want to like rabbit hole on that and read about it and be on email lists and stuff
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   like that.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.960]   Like that's fun.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.480]   It's just about finding these alternative things you do that you get used to and they
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.960]   just don't feel as dragging.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.400]   They don't feel like doom scrolling.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   They feel interesting.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   I'm learning something.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.400]   I'm learning about baseball.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.400]   I'm learning about watches.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.840]   I'm reading these cool books and I really enjoy it.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:18.480]   We put a guitar, I play, my son plays, my other son plays ukulele.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.400]   My innovation was it needs to be right in the front foyer of the house so you can just
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.960]   grab it whenever and just like play a little guitar.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.960]   It's next to our piano.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.960]   And they do.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   They pick it up and they'll play a little bit.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.360]   And I'm starting to do that a little bit more now.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.880]   So you got to find, you got to aggressively invest in finding the alternative activities
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.960]   to scratch the same itch that the doom scroll is doing, but doing it in a way that's a scratch
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:43.060]   that's much more satisfying than what you're getting from these other content universes.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:49.080]   As for my app idea would be good, Jesse, where it is email newsletters and podcasts and in
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   like a really nice app.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:53.200]   Like that would be a great thing to turn to like you're a little bit bored, you're a little
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   bit tired.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.680]   I'm like, yeah, I'm going to read like an interesting email newsletter.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.680]   I'm not going to feel bad about it.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:03.520]   There's no weird algorithmic hypnosis that you get when you're looking at social media
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.440]   and it's not going to make you feel bad.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.560]   You're not going to read a Cal Newport email newsletter and just be like, oh my God, the
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:14.360]   world is, you know, it's going to be, focus is great and don't answer too many emails.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   It's going to be good.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.760]   You feel good about it.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.480]   What's the Vegas over under for Nat's wins this year?
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.400]   Which projection do you care about?
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.580]   There's two different projections.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:29.080]   One of them is a little bit more optimistic and it's 72, 74.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.240]   That would have been my guess.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.120]   There's a less optimistic one that's like 65.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.120]   I think they'll do 75.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   You're going to bet on it?
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.120]   Yeah, I'll bet.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:43.240]   Mad Dog always has the over-unders for like certain teams every year for football, baseball,
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   hockey, basketball.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.400]   I would take the over on even the more optimistic.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:53.340]   They've done 72 the last two seasons in a row and they just have, their core is better.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.340]   Tough division.
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:57.480]   It's a tough division, but it's not betting on them making the playoffs.
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.940]   It's just betting on them winning 74 games.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.240]   And they have like eight available pitchers.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:09.940]   That makes such a difference when you can react to pitcher injuries in July much more
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.940]   effectively.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.440]   The wins you get, there's four wins right there, five wins right there, it's like, yeah,
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.700]   when we had two concurrent pitcher injuries, we're still able to get three victories instead
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.000]   of one out of like a five game stretch because we have like a deeper bench, like that sort
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.760]   of thing adds up.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.440]   I was, who was I?
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.880]   I was messing around with Holiday, Ryan Holiday, I was texting him the other day because I
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.080]   was reading about, it wasn't a national, or maybe it was a national, ooh, maybe it was
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.640]   a Washington national.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.840]   But anyways, it was about a baseball player and they're talking about in the off season,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.960]   they have the training camp, had started a book club so that the days they're not training,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.840]   instead of just being off days, they would read and like work on their mind.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.440]   And the pitcher they were talking to was like, yeah, Ryan's book, Ego is the Enemy is my,
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   that was my favorite or whatever.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.480]   So I texted Ryan, I was like, look, if and when you get invited to speak to the Washington
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.840]   nationals, I'm coming with you.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.400]   We'll figure out later like why it makes sense, but you are, if you get in with baseball players,
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.720]   like I'm coming with you, we'll figure out, I can just be your-
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.400]   What'd he say?
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   No.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.680]   I got the Tim Ferriss response.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.760]   I'll be traveling until November 7th and we'll delete any messages, so you'll have to resend
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.760]   it then.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   I forgot.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.760]   I think he said-
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.720]   And the nationals season will be over September 30th.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   Exactly.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   Exactly.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.680]   No, he said, who dis?
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.680]   Who dis?
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   Question mark.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680]   With a shrug emoji.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   Who dis?
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   All right.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   We got a case study here.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.320]   A case study is where people send in their accounts of putting the type of things we
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.200]   talk about on the show into practice in their own life so we can see what this actually
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.080]   looks like.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.200]   Today's, I almost don't want to use his name.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.840]   I guess he doesn't care about being anonymous, but like this is such a specific person, like
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840]   I know who this is.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.880]   I feel like if I gave their first name and tell this story, it's just 100% identifying
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   him.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880]   So I won't give his first name.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.560]   I still think it's going to 100% identify him, but I also don't think he cares.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560]   Right?
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.520]   I don't think he's trying to be anonymous.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.280]   How many announcers are there?
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.880]   Do you watch it a lot?
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.880]   No.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.880]   But you still know who he is?
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   No, I looked it up.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   It's not like Joe Buck.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.200]   No, I didn't.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200]   I looked it up.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200]   I was like, "Oh, I've seen him before."
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   Okay.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   All right.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.440]   Well, anyways, we'll see if we can guess who this is.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   Joe Buck.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.600]   "I'm a UFC announcer that has loved implementing slow productivity and a lot of other new Portonian
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.720]   ideas to make my life better, so thank you."
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.560]   This, by the way, is where I was like, "Is this Joe Rogan?"
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.360]   This would be great because, you're right, how many UFC announcers are there?
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.960]   So to get a note from a UFC announcer that says, "I've loved your book," I'm like, "Oh,
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.720]   this could be good."
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.720]   It's not Rogan though.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720]   No.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720]   He's not going to like you because you don't like Instagram.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   I know.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720]   Too mean to Elon.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   I know.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.640]   I don't think you ... I think he literally would not like me.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.640]   All right.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.960]   Anyways, back to the question.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.440]   "My job is different from office-based knowledge work, but finding your podcast in 2023 allowed
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.000]   me to find more efficient ways to execute work tasks and adjust to life with our one-year-old
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.040]   making us a family of four.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.120]   In early 2024, I pondered taking a break from my podcast and social media to deal with the
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.280]   overload I was feeling.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.440]   Putting that to the side allowed me to put more focus and effort on my family and the
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.280]   main part of my job, and I believe it made me so good to not be ignored for fun and unique
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.120]   opportunities with our partners at ESPN that better fit into my schedule."
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.280]   That's a confusing sentence.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.360]   I think he's saying, "It made me so good I couldn't be ignored, and that led to lots
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.200]   of fun and unique opportunities from our partners at ESPN.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.640]   In May, my wife wondered if living out of state for my company could be a possibility
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.160]   to be closer to family and provide a different lifestyle for our two young boys.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.200]   I asked, and my career capital gave us a yes, so off we went.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.440]   Since I never missed an episode of Deep Questions, living out of state didn't sound as crazy
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.760]   to me as it would have if I didn't know about lifestyle and career planning.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.480]   We found a wonderful community where we've made great new friends and spend more time
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.680]   with family.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.200]   Our elementary school-age son is thriving and loves his new environment, and I volunteer
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.960]   often at his school, which has fulfilled a yearn for being part of our community that
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.620]   we didn't have in our previous location.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.040]   My job requires me to travel as a result, but it is very manageable, and since many
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.240]   of my colleagues that I work closest with live all over the country, it's great for
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.080]   bonding with dinners and a walk to get coffee or chats in the hotel lobby.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.760]   For the local coworkers, I actually see them more now in social settings than I did when
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.440]   I lived in the same city because I'm not juggling family responsibilities when I'm there for
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.720]   the two or three days at a time.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.920]   Can't say thank you enough for the constant flow of ideas and new perspectives with the
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   podcast.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.480]   I've read many of your books and can't wait for the next one.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480]   P.S.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.680]   I remember loving Cal's description of what would happen if he played golf at the Masters.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.640]   I'd love a similar description of Cal as a UFC fighter and how it would go.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   I don't remember my Masters.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   Was it like the club went flying and somehow like it injured someone?
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:10.440]   God, me as a UFC fighter, I think would go terrible.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.240]   I'm trying to imagine the announcing, right?
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:19.760]   They'd be like, "All right, in the blue corner, we have 42-year-old Cal Newport wearing what
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.640]   appears to be a somewhat wrinkled blue button-down shirt."
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.640]   Not sure about this decision.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.320]   Seems a little out of shape, but we'll see here.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   Okay.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.720]   We're entering the arena from the other side.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:40.800]   We have Francis Nagano here to defend his 10-times-whatever championship belt, and yep,
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.320]   Cal is tapping.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320]   Newport is tapping.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:49.240]   Nagano is still 150 feet from the ring, but he is tapping, and that is a motorcycle.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.840]   I believe that is producer Jesse driving it.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.840]   Cal has jumped in a sidecar, and they have driven out of the arena.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.760]   That's how that would go down.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.320]   That is how that would go down.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.120]   I would tap in the locker room.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120]   They'd be like, "At the weigh-in."
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.000]   They'd be like, "All right, we need to weigh you in."
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.520]   I'd be like, "I'm tapping.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.680]   I'm out of here."
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.920]   I mean, UFC announcing, I assume the fights are in different locations, right?
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.360]   That's the one thing I was trying to figure out.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   He said, "I have to travel now."
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:23.600]   But I would assume, wouldn't you have to travel anyways, or are they mainly in Vegas?
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.160]   They're probably mainly in Vegas, but they are in different locations, too.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.960]   It's funny, Coach K had a guest on, ESPN/NBA guy, a couple of weeks ago, and he was like,
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.320]   he moved to Omaha, because he goes, "Otherwise, you're just chasing the team."
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320]   He goes, "That doesn't work."
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.400]   I mean, this is like the people like Holladay who live in Austin, for example.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.560]   One of the things they'll say about it is, "You're in the middle of the state, so you're
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.840]   minimizing your average."
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.440]   If you're doing U.S. travel, everything now is under three hours.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   All right.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   So that's it.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.440]   Okay.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.440]   So maybe, just so we understand the story, right?
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.440]   So he's in Vegas.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.680]   Maybe the headquarters of UFC are there, so there's stuff to do in the headquarters, and
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   80% of your fights were there.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.800]   So now he has to travel more.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.920]   I love this case, because I think it's a great example of lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:16.200]   They're working backwards from what they want in their lifestyle, but in order to accomplish
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.080]   that lifestyle, they're working forwards with their career capital.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.520]   So he's thinking very carefully, "What do I do that's really good?
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.280]   What do I do that's valuable to the marketplace?
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.560]   How good am I at that?
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.900]   To what degree can I use that as leverage to help get things I want in my lifestyle?"
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.380]   So the lifestyle plus career capital is that really powerful combination.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.040]   Typically what someone would do in this situation, there's two big traps that people would fall
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.040]   into.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:47.400]   So the first trap would be the grand goal thinking, that just pursuing the really exciting
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.640]   style goal will by itself solve all the problems, which he did.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.400]   If you're really into sports, UFC is an exciting sport to be an announcer.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:03.880]   You're hanging out at these fights with these fighters, and with Joe and Dana White.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.520]   If you just focus on the big, exciting thing, all you'll be thinking is, "How do I do even
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.800]   more of this?"
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.480]   All that matters is, "How do I call more fights, or how do I make my podcast even bigger?"
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.520]   You don't think about the rest of your lifestyle.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.320]   But look at all these other things that mattered for his happiness.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.600]   Being involved in his kid's school, being closer to family, being in a community that
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.080]   had more of a community sense.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.920]   I can imagine if you're in Vegas, it's a big city, right?
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.340]   Maybe they're in a place that is smaller.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.880]   So he avoided the grand goal trap.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.600]   He's doing something really cool, but he's still working backwards from a lifestyle vision,
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.920]   and not just thinking that one grand goal, if achieved, is going to make me happy.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.320]   But he's also avoiding the other trap, which happens when people are younger, which is
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.060]   like, "I just want all these things in my lifestyle right away.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.960]   Why won't people give them to me?
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.480]   Why can't I live here and just travel to go do things, and I want to live in a completely
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.760]   different place, but you have to pay for me to fly in?
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.960]   Why don't people understand this is what I want to do in my life, and why is this so
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   hard?
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   Just make me happy.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   Why would they not want to make me happy?"
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.000]   But you have no career capital to barter for it.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.240]   So that's the other mistake.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:12.200]   You want to immediately get your ideal lifestyle, but you have no bartering chips.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.640]   Or you have all sorts of bartering chips, but you've just placed all of your emphasis
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.080]   on accomplishing this goal, hoping that'll solve everything.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.760]   He has avoided both of those traps.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.980]   He's gotten very good at something, and then has carefully invested that career capital
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:31.320]   to make their lifestyle closer to the things that him and his wife think are important.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.360]   So I think it's a fantastic example.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.000]   Let me know when you do your next UFC fight in D.C.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   They don't do them here.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   It'd be cool.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.360]   I've never been to a UFC fight.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.920]   But my son has started doing a little bit of jiu-jitsu.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   Yeah, you mentioned that.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.420]   So at the Tacoma MMA.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   So it'd be great.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.080]   I could maybe take him to a fight.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.400]   And if, look, if I need to step in the ring, take care of business, I'll take care of business.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.840]   Or if your son ever needs an announcer for one of his matches.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840]   Now we're talking.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.280]   A professional announcer for Tacoma MMA.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   All right.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.880]   So thanks for that case study.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.920]   We got a cool final segment coming up.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.160]   I want to react to a meme related to our work.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.840]   But first, let's talk about another one of our sponsors.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:19.160]   So have you ever woken up with a funky symptom, like a swollen itchy eye or some sort of funny
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.000]   looking rash, and you're thinking, what do I do about this?
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.360]   Let me jump on TikTok and see if I can get some advice.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.040]   But that doesn't work out well, because quickly you're getting TikTok videos where people
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.600]   say, like, yeah, my eye was itchy, and then the next day I lost my leg, and now I'm going
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600]   to do a dance.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.360]   You know, this is not helpful, right?
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:41.620]   What you realize is, ah, I need medical care, but how am I going to find a doctor?
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.760]   And that's where a lot of us say, I give up.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.960]   It's too hard.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.840]   How do I find out what doctors are around?
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.920]   And then how do I find out if they're taking patients, and if they are taking patients,
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.400]   like how do I know if they take my insurance, and how do I know if their patients actually
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   like them?
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.440]   And then how do I know if they have an appointment anytime soon?
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.800]   This feels like 100 steps.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.080]   It's going to take me forever.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.320]   I guess my leg is going to just fall off, and I'm going to have to do dances on TikTok.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.360]   This is where ZocDoc enters the scene.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.480]   ZocDoc is a free app and website where you can search and compare high quality in-network
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.520]   doctors and click to instantly book an appointment.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.520]   All right, we're talking about booking in-network appointments with more than 100,000 doctors
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.280]   across every specialty from mental health to dental health, primary care to urgent care,
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.380]   and more.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.980]   You can filter for doctors who take your insurance, are located nearby, are a good fit for any
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.440]   medical needs you may have, and are highly rated by verified patients.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.880]   Once you find the right doctor, you can see their actual appointment openings, choose
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.300]   a time slot, click, boom, booked.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.400]   You're doing this all from an app or online.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.560]   Appointments made through ZocDoc happen fast, typically within just 24 to 72 hours of booking.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.280]   You can even score some same-day appointments.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.400]   So stop putting off those doctor appointments and go to ZocDoc.com/deep to find and instantly
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.160]   book a top-rated doctor today.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:07.480]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:11.000]   I would have to burn up my ZocDoc app if I was going to go do a UFC fight.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.920]   I think I would do like seven doctors standing by.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:21.760]   My life insurance premium, I think, would jump from $55 a month to $500,000 a month.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.240]   Like, you just owe us a lot of money.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.920]   All right, I also want to talk about our friends at Oracle.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.920]   Even if you think it's a bit overhyped, AI is suddenly everywhere, from self-driving
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.160]   cars to molecular medicine to business efficiency.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.120]   If it's not in your industry yet, it is coming fast.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.000]   But AI needs a lot of speed and computing power.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.260]   So how do you compete without costs spiraling out of control?
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:53.320]   Time to upgrade to the next generation of cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or OCI.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.000]   OCI is a blazing fast and secure platform for your infrastructure, database, application
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.240]   development, plus all your AI and machine learning workloads.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:10.200]   OCI costs 50% less for compute and 80% less for networking, so you're saving a pile of
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   money.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.920]   Thousands of businesses have already upgraded to OCI, including Vodafone, Thomson Reuters,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.440]   and Suno AI.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:23.680]   Right now Oracle is offering to cut your current cloud bill in half if you move to OCI.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.920]   For new U.S. customers with minimum financial commitment, offer ends March 31st.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:34.720]   See if your company qualifies for this special offer at oracle.com/deepquestions.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   That's oracle.com/deepquestions.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:42.720]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to our final segment.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.520]   I'm literally being called by Brad Stolberg.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.480]   Once we figure out how to do the Bluetooth Rodecaster Pro 2, we can get him that ad.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.480]   We're so close.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.600]   So our new software has the ability, you can Bluetooth to the mixing board and then bring
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.600]   in a call to the air.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.680]   So Brad, you were just saved.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.780]   I was going to put you on the air without you knowing.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.000]   And then you could have talked about the fender.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   That's the thing.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.080]   Every time I do that ad, Brad has to call in.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.800]   That's the new way we're going to do this.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.800]   All right, for our final segment, I have a little bit of fun.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   Someone sent me Clemons.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   I'll give him credit.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.400]   Clemons, long-time listener to the show, sent me a meme I'll put on the screen here.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.080]   I don't know if he made this or it's just one that exists out there.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.160]   But it's a meme about my discussion of what really matters when it comes to productivity
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160]   software.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.760]   Jesse, can we do the thing where we make our YouTube guy mad and make it full screen?
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760]   Ha.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   All right.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.400]   All of our viewers are leaving.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.240]   All right, I have it full screen on the screen right now.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.800]   All right, so this is like one of these internet-y memes where they have those like drawings
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.080]   of the crying face or whatever.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.600]   Do you know these meme style?
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.000]   Like I'm vaguely aware of it.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   No.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.120]   I think it comes out of like 4chan culture or something.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.200]   Anyways, and I'm sure this is probably inappropriate in all sorts of ways.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.120]   There's a bell curve here of IQs.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.480]   On the left-hand side where it's really low IQs, there's like a picture of a really dumb
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.340]   looking person, right?
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.440]   And the tool above him is Apple Notes.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.520]   Then in the middle, like in the middle range of like normal IQs, there's a crying face
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.560]   meme, that sort of like angry crying face meme.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.680]   And above him is all of these complicated "productivity applications" all pointing to each other.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.480]   There's Anki and Quizlet and Adobe and Arrows connecting things to other things.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.520]   And then you go to the right side to the very high IQ, the 0.1%, and you see the sort of
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.080]   meme drawing of like a Jedi, like the person with the hood.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.460]   And what's above his head, it's Apple Notes again.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:49.360]   So the idea is using just like a text file for your productivity is both like the dumb
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.360]   thing to do, but also like the thing that the real productivity masters do as well.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.320]   And it's only the people in between to get lost in all those different types of apps.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.720]   I almost agree with this, Clemens, except for one change.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.520]   I would not use Apple Notes.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.840]   I would use TextEdit.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   Apple Notes is no good.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.240]   I don't like using Apple Notes.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.080]   I just use unformatted TextEdit on all my computers.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.320]   I have a file called WorkingMemory.txt.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.520]   It's arguably one of the most important digital productivity tools I have because I just dump
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520]   stuff in it.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.240]   I kind of work out what's going on.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.920]   I drop stuff that I copy in the emails.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.400]   It literally is an extension of my brain and is the simplest possible technology you can
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.740]   run on a computer.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.800]   So I love this bigger idea.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:38.120]   I make this argument in my old student books, especially How to Become a Straight-A Student.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.240]   And like one of the big observations, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, but one
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:47.240]   of the big observations when I studied students who got really good grades but weren't grinds
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:50.480]   is they cared a lot about their systems, how they studied, how they took notes, how they
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   wrote papers, how they prepared for problems, et cetera.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.360]   They cared a lot about their systems, but they got rid of any friction they could get
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.520]   rid of.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.880]   Friction is the killer of systems.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:06.160]   So you might really like your AI-optimized, Zapier-connected, multi-tool, cloud-hosted
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.960]   idea, storage, generation, productivity tool, and it might be fun to build that in the same
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.560]   way that it's fun to build a cabinet if you're into woodworking.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.160]   But the friction of using that thing is going to wear down.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.180]   It's going to strip your momentum, and eventually you're going to stop using it.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:25.280]   You want the easiest possible tool, the lowest friction possible tool that accomplishes the
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.760]   goal you want to accomplish.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:33.000]   And they're never sexy, and they're often just using a shared document, a text file.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.800]   The most complicated thing in my digital productivity universe is Trello.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.320]   And if I didn't have Trello, I would just do this on Google Docs.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.320]   I'm actually doing this right now for my administrative role.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320]   We've talked on the show before.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.680]   It's my turn to be the director of undergraduate studies for the computer science department
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.800]   at Georgetown, and there's a lot of student issues I have to keep track of.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.580]   I'm not even using-- I don't know why I got off of it.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.640]   But for whatever reason now, I'm just using a Google Doc.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.680]   And it's not just-- it's not even a dedicated Google Doc.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.160]   It is the Google Doc I created to kind of keep notes on the different processes for
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   this role.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:12.040]   So as I learn how different processes work, like, oh, how do I approve a credit from an
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.880]   external university, I put notes in this document just so I have them.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.240]   It's the top of that document.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.700]   I just have a bold thing that says "open" and a bold thing that says "resolved."
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:28.040]   And I just am, like, taking notes, like, this student is working, you know, needs me to
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.040]   approve this.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   I'm waiting to hear back from this person.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.280]   I haven't even had the time yet to-- I haven't even bothered moving it to Trello columns.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.760]   It's just unformatted text in a Google Doc I'm using for something else.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.360]   And it's fine, because I'm in that document a lot anyways, and I can just review it.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.360]   Hey, what's going on?
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   What's the status?
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.960]   It doesn't have to be in, like, some nice fields or formatted in, like, an air table.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:48.960]   I know what I mean.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.820]   I just type this bullet point list, and it's fine.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.820]   I know what's going on.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.040]   And when I resolve, I paste it below, and if someone asks me, like, hey, whatever happened
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040]   with that student?
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040]   I'm like, oh, I'm sure it's in here somewhere.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.040]   Oh, here's what I did.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.640]   So I love that idea.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:05.720]   You know, sometimes-- not sometimes, most of the time-- the best productivity tool is
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.000]   the one that generates the least amount of friction while still accomplishing more or
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.520]   less what you needed to accomplish.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.120]   And I don't know.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.880]   You can't make a lot of money off those tools.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.120]   They're often stuff you have anyways.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   But there you go.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.120]   I do have a new tool, actually.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.080]   Oh, I didn't bring it in here.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.480]   I do have a new toy.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.120]   What do we got?
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:32.480]   The good folks at Remarkable sent me their brand new state-of-the-art Remarkable.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   We talked about it.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   You brought it to the show.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   Did we talk about it?
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.480]   Did I?
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.480]   Oh.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480]   Should we edit this out so you don't sound like--
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   I sound dotty.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   All right.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   Remember to edit that out.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   Let's get Brad on the phone here.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.480]   Come on.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480]   Actually, you know what?
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480]   Leave it in.
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   Brad.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480]   Brad.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.480]   Did I talk about the Remarkable already?
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.600]   Are you in your Defender?
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.960]   Well, I was talking to someone about it.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.200]   Anyways, I really like it.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.800]   There you go.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   This is a good one.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.500]   But what did I find out?
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.600]   It has the number one-- OK.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.800]   I'm going to add-- here's my Remarkable promotion.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.760]   The thing they added-- there's a lot of things they added to this new thing.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.760]   It's bigger.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.760]   It's thinner.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.160]   And it has a backlight or a light so I can use it in bed.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:30.040]   But the number one thing they added, the innovation that has been most useful to me is the original
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:36.500]   Remarkable, like an iPad or whatever, you magnetically stick the stylus on the side.
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.580]   And this was a big problem with me with my original Remarkable, because if you put that
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.720]   in a backpack with other stuff, it just gets knocked off.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.720]   And you lose it.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   So I would have to separate the two.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:49.640]   If I had the stylus, I would have to put it in the pocket where you put your wallet.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.640]   But then it wouldn't charge?
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.680]   Actually, I don't know if it uses a charge.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.880]   Unlike the Apple Pencil, the Remarkable stylus is not charged.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.320]   It just stores magnetically, I think.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.320]   I don't know.
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.680]   But they would always get separated.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:07.160]   They added to the new one, to the Folio, a little magnetic clasp strap that you just
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.160]   strap around.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.600]   And it holds the pencil on, even if you put it in another bag.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   That's the type of stuff.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600]   That's low friction right there.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.700]   That saves the friction of having to-- They probably got a lot of comments about
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.080]   the same problem that you were having.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   Yeah, probably.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.200]   But anyways, I do like my Remarkable, and I will talk about that once a week.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.200]   All right.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.840]   Well, clearly, I need to go take a nap or something like that.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.840]   So we should wrap up this episode now.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.240]   Thank you, everyone who listened.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:38.280]   We'll be back next week with another show, and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.440]   Hey, if you liked today's discussion about drowning, treading, and swimming, I think
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:48.600]   you'll also like episode 339, called "Let Brandon Cook," where I get into the details
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:54.300]   about how the author, Brandon Sanderson, avoids drowning or treading and makes sure that he
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.300]   can be swimming as well.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.880]   It's a great complement to today's discussion.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   Check it out.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   I think you'll like it.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:04.380]   It caught my attention because I think it actually says something profound about some
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.600]   of the deep problems in the way we organize work in our current moment.
