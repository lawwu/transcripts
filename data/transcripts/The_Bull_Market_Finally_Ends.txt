[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and it is March 11, 2020.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   And it is officially a bear market in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.400]   And we're basically almost in a bear market with the S&P 500 down about 19%.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.680]   Now down 20% from the high is an arbitrary number, but that's something we've arbitrarily
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.140]   used since the history of the stock market.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:32.500]   So the last bear market for the S&P 500 ran from October 9, 2007 through March 9, 2009.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.820]   So not that long, but the index did fall about 57% in that 17-month period as the US housing
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.900]   downturn and mortgage crisis erupted, triggering a credit crunch.
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.340]   This time, a recession is not being triggered by a financial crunch, but obviously the coronavirus
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.500]   and the paralysis of consumers to spend money to go out and so forth.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.740]   You're going to see massive knock-on effects with freelance workers getting hurt because
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.680]   they simply cannot deliver food or drive cars and so forth.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.460]   So on average, bear markets have lasted about 14 months in the period since World War II,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.820]   while market corrections have lasted on average about five months.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.260]   The S&P 500 index has fallen an average of about 32-33% during bear markets in this time
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.340]   period.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.980]   So if you want to do a not-so-fun exercise, take whatever equity exposure you have in
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.180]   the markets right now and then lop off another, let's say, 12-15%, and then you're going to
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.500]   have the average decline in the average bear market.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   So if you can withstand that other 12-13% hit, hopefully you should be okay.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.620]   And that hopefully means you have the proper risk exposure.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.380]   Now, history has also shown that the faster an index enters into a bear market, the shorter
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.820]   they tend to be.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.060]   Historically, stocks take 270 days to fall into a bear market.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.800]   Now this market, well, we got here in under 30 days.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.640]   So hopefully we're going to see a faster recovery.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.780]   So when the S&P 500 has fallen 20% at a faster clip, which is what we're experiencing now,
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.960]   the index has averaged a loss of about 26%.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.540]   So to do some not-so-fun analysis, take whatever your equity exposure is and lop off another
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.180]   6% and you're going to get to that average.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.060]   Now of course, nobody knows what's going to happen in the future.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.420]   But if you look at China, China first quarter GDP is in the dumps, obviously, but you're
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.900]   seeing a resumption of economic activity because there's been a drastic slowdown in coronavirus
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   new cases and deaths.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.540]   So what you'd expect to see is a V-shaped recovery in the China market, which is kind
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.620]   of what you're seeing right now.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.540]   And you also see in the China equity markets, the local markets rebound quite nicely.
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.820]   So let's say we are one month behind China.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.820]   Hopefully we can see and experience what they are seeing and experiencing right now.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.860]   But the problem is, Americans, we are a democracy.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.100]   We like to do whatever we want.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.740]   I was at the tennis club the other day for three hours playing tennis and it was packed.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.660]   It was packed between 3.30 and 6.30 p.m.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.940]   Whereas in China, it's just a much quicker directive.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.220]   Stay inside, don't do this, don't do that.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.580]   They built a thousand bed hospital, what, in like two weeks or something like that.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.100]   Whereas if you try to get that done here in San Francisco, it would take maybe two years.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.260]   It's just so much bureaucracy, so much individualism, which is part of what makes America great.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.860]   But it's also one of our weak spots.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.660]   When people start telling us what to do, nobody likes to get told what to do, especially here
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.660]   in America.
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.620]   I will say that this time period right now feels quite similar to the 9/11 tragedy.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.860]   I remember that quite clearly because I was at the top of the World Trade Center for a
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.820]   conference, a Latin American emerging conference, just two weeks or three weeks before.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.100]   And I lived at 45 Wall Street, which is only a couple blocks away or so.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.140]   And it was a devastating time.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.500]   But I remember the country came together on both sides of the political party.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.600]   Yes, there were some ugly incidences of racism and a lot of fear mongering.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.080]   But I remember New York City, Manhattan, especially coming together to help everybody in need.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.940]   And I think and I hope this is exactly what's going to happen in the United States today.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.420]   You know, there's still a lot of denial about the coronavirus negatively affecting people.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.060]   And look, chances are high that you won't get it.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.340]   And if you do get it, chances are high that you will survive.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.500]   It's only after about the age of 60 and 70 where the death rate starts to massively tick
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.700]   upwards to the 5% to 8% level.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.340]   What's interesting to note is that during the SARS outbreak, I was reading that no kids
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.500]   under five or 10 died from SARS.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.200]   And it does look like so far in 2020, children are not as affected by the coronavirus for
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.180]   some reason, maybe it's the developmental process of their lungs or whatnot.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.280]   I'm not a scientist, but that's just what the facts are.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:30.740]   If your kid is under five or 10, he or she is safer than the rest of the older population.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.100]   And speaking of toddlers, I took my son out of preschool this week because it just didn't
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.580]   make sense that many companies around the Bay were encouraging or actually forcing their
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.660]   workers to work from home.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.460]   So why the heck am I putting my child at risk to be in a school of 50 other kids and teachers?
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.460]   It just felt bad.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.980]   I felt really, really guilty.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.940]   So I brought him home and we've been spending a lot of time at the park in the playground.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.740]   And I was talking to one of the mothers the other day, and she said she just has no other
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.780]   choice.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.180]   She drops her daughter off at 730 in the morning because she has to get to work by eight in
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.180]   the morning.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.220]   And she picks her daughter up at 530pm.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.220]   And it was interesting.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.660]   And it's kind of sad because I usually spend about 20 minutes during transition period
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.300]   when I drop off my son.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.500]   And I saw her daughter there on Monday morning and she was coughing and it was clear she
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.540]   was sick.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.140]   But the mother had no other choice.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.880]   She had no way to take care of her own child.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.220]   So she dropped her child off at preschool.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.780]   And unfortunately, she's probably going to get a lot of the other classmates sick, who
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.900]   are then going to get their parents sick.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.980]   And it just never ends.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.660]   It's a never ending cycle, because of money or the desire for the money, or the need for
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.660]   money.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.500]   So I'm assuming that this coronavirus pandemic is really going to spur the conversation forward
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:04.060]   on universal basic health care, sick leave, vacation day policies, and help for freelance
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.220]   workers.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.140]   Freelance work is totally booming and it's going to overcome normal day job work sometime
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.140]   in the near future.
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.180]   However, there's probably a speed bump happening right now because freelance workers simply
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.380]   cannot make enough money to get by when there's no work.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.260]   They don't have the luxury to keep on earning, keep on growing vacation days if they're out
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.340]   sick.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.900]   So this is something that we definitely have to bake in if you want to do freelance work.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.820]   I did a calculation a long time ago that you've got to earn about 35% more as a freelancer
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.040]   or as an entrepreneur to replicate your day job income.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.060]   And it's in an article on Financial Samaritan if you want to Google it, basically asking
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:54.780]   how much money do you have to make as an entrepreneur to replace your day job income.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.580]   And I hear my son climbing up the stairs now as I work from home.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.440]   And this is one of the troubles of working from home is there's nowhere to hide unless
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.700]   you live in a big, big mansion.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.700]   Speaking of big, big mansions, I think one of the knock-on effects of the coronavirus
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.460]   is that homebuyers are going to look for bigger houses now to accommodate one or two people
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.960]   working from home.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.380]   So a bigger house will hopefully have an extra bedroom that can be turned into an office
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.980]   or a dedicated office and then maybe there's an extra bathroom.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.900]   If you look at the data, the average home size is something around 2,500 something square
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.900]   feet.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.280]   It's been declining steadily since 2014.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.940]   So maybe, maybe that trend will reverse as we look for larger and larger homes.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.940]   Huh?
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.940]   What do you want Daddy to do?
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.940]   Play.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.860]   You want Daddy to play?
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.660]   Do you like these cool pictures?
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.260]   Whoops, I'm back.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.780]   Gotta do a little timeout, right?
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.640]   Take care of my boy.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.780]   So maybe I will write a post on working from home survival guide because it can be really,
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.420]   really tough folks.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.740]   And just going back to real estate, I think real estate is very attractive now.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.500]   And I'm doing some research on how much the stock market has to go down before real estate
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.220]   starts getting in trouble.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.580]   And the preliminary research and the preliminary thought process is that the stock market down
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.620]   by up to about 20%.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.580]   I think people are just really going to want to gravitate towards real estate because it's
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.580]   more stable and it is a steady cash flow.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:36.820]   And also because mortgage rates are collapsing, the affordability has increased tremendously.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.000]   And so a lot of people are refinancing their mortgages or doing cash out refinances or
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.180]   getting a loan to try to buy real estate.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.060]   Unfortunately, inventory is still quite low.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.020]   So I think real estate is really going to outperform the stock market in 2020.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.020]   How could it not, right?
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.500]   I mean, the S&P 500 is down almost 20%, whereas real estate is probably flat up a little bit,
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.620]   just like the bond market.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.340]   But at some point, if the stock market gets too terrible, there's going to be tremendous
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:11.420]   fears of a recession, which might override the demand and the desire for property.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:17.180]   In conclusion, I hope this bear market has taught us more about risk tolerance, taught
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:23.020]   us more not to confuse brains with the bull market, and has taught us more about the importance
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.980]   of diversity and the importance of investing in risk-free assets and a diversified number
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.720]   of assets.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.400]   It's really sad after 11 years that the bull market is officially over.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.280]   But I think like always, it's good to focus on the positives, on how much we've learned
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.180]   since 2009, how much we've made since 2009, and how much we've grown as people.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.100]   I'm on my fatherhood journey now, and it's going to be for another 18 years, since my
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.660]   daughter is only 11 weeks old.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.500]   And I'm looking forward to getting better as a father, better as a writer, better as
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.980]   an investor, and better as a communicator.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.700]   And I hope all of you guys focus on one or two things you want to get better at as well,
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.180]   besides just accumulating more money.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.520]   Because money at the end of the day is a means to an end, and hopefully that end is a better
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.280]   life for you and me and for everyone.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.640]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.360]   Please stay safe.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.000]   Please stay hygienic.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And take a look at your assets and make sure you have the appropriate risk tolerance and
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.520]   risk exposure out there.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.240]   It could get very, very dicey.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:32.360]   Again, the average bear market declines about 32%, 33%, and we're only down about 20%.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.920]   So fingers crossed, hope for the best, but expect the worst, and I'll see you guys around.
