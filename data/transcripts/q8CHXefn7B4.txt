[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.640]   My guest today is Chris Voss.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   Chris Voss spent more than two decades as an agent
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.800]   with the FBI or Federal Bureau of Investigation,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.780]   where he was a lead crisis negotiator
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.340]   and a member of the Joint Terrorist Task Force.
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.840]   Chris is also the author of a phenomenal best-selling book
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240]   entitled "Never Split the Difference."
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.840]   In addition, he has taught courses in negotiation
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.900]   at Harvard, at Georgetown,
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.440]   and at the University of Southern California.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520]   As a world expert in all forms of negotiation,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.180]   today Chris teaches us about how to hold hard conversations
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.080]   where we are seeking particular outcomes,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.600]   or perhaps where we don't know
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.680]   what the optimal outcome could be.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.120]   He talks about this in the context of business,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.840]   in the context of relationships,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.700]   including romantic relationships,
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.660]   but familial and work relationships as well.
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.780]   And he talks about how we should think about ourselves
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.740]   in the context of negotiations
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.800]   so that we can all arrive at the best possible outcomes.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.860]   Indeed, during today's episode,
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.960]   you will learn to pay attention to emotions,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.100]   not just other people's emotions, but your own emotions,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.620]   in order to determine whether or not
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.660]   you are processing the information you're hearing accurately,
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.980]   and equally important,
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.820]   whether or not you are being heard accurately
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.760]   when you are in a discussion of any kind,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.820]   but especially heated discussions.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.300]   In addition, we discuss the role
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.440]   of both physical and mental stamina
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.660]   in the context of difficult conversations,
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.840]   negotiations, and decision-making,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.280]   because in the real world context,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.260]   oftentimes those can take place
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.160]   not just within a single conversation,
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.820]   but over the course of several days
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.460]   or even several weeks, months, or years.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.880]   Chris also teaches us about deception,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.380]   that is, how to determine if somebody is lying
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.440]   by asking particular types of probe questions.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.620]   Thanks to Chris Voss' both breadth and depth of expertise
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.940]   in the negotiation process
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.360]   that he gleaned during his more than two-decade service
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.680]   in the FBI, as well as his generosity
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.300]   in sharing that information,
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.000]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.300]   you will have an excellent understanding
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.100]   of what the negotiation process is really all about
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.560]   and how to better carry out those negotiations
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.260]   so that they can best serve you and others.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.900]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.460]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.520]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.020]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.560]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.660]   Our first sponsor is Plunge.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.100]   Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.900]   at-home self-cooling cold plunge
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.780]   for deliberate cold exposure.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.120]   I've talked numerous times on this podcast
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.640]   about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.940]   Deliberate cold exposure,
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.380]   especially deliberate cold exposure
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.740]   done up to the neck in water,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.040]   can be used to achieve a number of important endpoints
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.500]   related to mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   Plunge uses a powerful cooling, filtration,
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.680]   and sanitation unit to give you access
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.080]   to deliberate cold exposure in clean water
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.420]   whenever you want.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.900]   I've been using a plunge for more than two years now.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.040]   I can tell you that it makes it very easy
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.460]   to get your deliberate cold exposure at home.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.860]   It doesn't require much cleaning.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.220]   In fact, it's very easy to keep clean, which is essential.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.580]   You don't want bacteria and other things
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.860]   growing in your cold plunge.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.460]   Basically, everything about the plunge is made easy
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460]   so that anyone, including myself,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.060]   can get their deliberate cold exposure
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.740]   on a regular basis at home.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.220]   If you're interested in getting a plunge,
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.420]   you can go to plunge, spelled P-L-U-N-G-E,
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.540]   .com/huberman, and get $150 off your cold plunge.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.940]   Again, that's plunge.com/huberman for $150 off.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.780]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.780]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.540]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.820]   the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.620]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.220]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.820]   in order for you to be able to see clearly
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.980]   in different environments.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.220]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.240]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.840]   so that you always see with crystal clarity.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.080]   Originally, their glasses were designed for performance,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.660]   that is, for running and cycling and for sport,
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.780]   and indeed, they can still be used for performance.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.700]   They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.980]   They're extremely lightweight,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.920]   but I should mention that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.960]   come in some of the aesthetics more typically associated
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.260]   with performance glasses, like those cyborg-style glasses,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.840]   but they also have a number of styles
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.240]   that you would be perfectly comfortable
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.920]   wearing out to dinner or to work.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.600]   I wear readers at night or when I drive,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.560]   and I wear sunglasses during the day
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.120]   if I happen to be driving into bright light or outside
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.740]   and it's just overwhelmingly bright.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.240]   I do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.760]   viewing to set my circadian rhythm,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.080]   and I suggest that you do the same.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.520]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.120]   you can go to Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.460]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.800]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.400]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.920]   And now for my conversation with Chris Voss.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.140]   Chris Voss, welcome.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.440]   - Andrew, pleasure, man.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.280]   - I've been wanting to talk to you on record for a while.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   You are quite the, what we call in science, N of one,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.780]   when somebody is a true sample size of one.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.140]   I realized that, yes, you are,
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.080]   because you have this incredible skillset
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.780]   from your time in the FBI.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.020]   But you also have an incredible understanding
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.340]   and knowledge of how to communicate about that skillset
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.500]   so that people can glean useful information from it.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.460]   You were also the guy that I text or call
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.480]   every once in a while when I've run myself into a jam
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.880]   or when I think I might be in a jam
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.980]   and I won't reveal details,
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.120]   but you tell me whether or not things are okay.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.140]   Unfortunately, the last couple of times I reached out,
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.700]   you said you're good.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.540]   So thank you.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.580]   - Always happy to help, man.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.780]   - Thank you.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.580]   Well, I have a lot of questions today,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.340]   but what I'd like to start off talking about
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.500]   is negotiations take many forms,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.180]   but if we could break those down
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.900]   into their broad categories, that will be useful.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.020]   But before we do that,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.260]   I want to know about the mindset that you have
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.420]   when you go into a negotiation
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.580]   and whether or not there are any practices.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.260]   I realize you've been in this profession a long time,
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.980]   and so it perhaps became reflexive to you at some point,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.220]   but all of us at some point are going to negotiations,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.900]   business negotiations, relationship negotiations, et cetera.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.180]   Is there a process of getting one's mind and body right
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.740]   for a negotiation, shifting from more listening
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.820]   and less talking?
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.260]   Are there any tools that you use on the regular
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.660]   that could be useful for us to keep in mind
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.460]   as we extend into the different categories of negotiations
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.740]   and ways to approach those negotiations?
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.740]   - And it can be a couple of different.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.020]   First of all, just trying to figure out
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.060]   what's really going on is the real issue.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.420]   And then how can I get an approach
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.600]   where I'm most likely to get the best possible outcome?
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.860]   So there's always more than meets the eye.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.640]   And there's a certain few cliches,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.300]   but the real issue is there's always a better deal
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.880]   or there's no deal at all.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.780]   So first of all, my first thing is I want to find out
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.180]   whether or not there's a deal at all
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.700]   or whether or not it's a bad deal.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.400]   And then I'm going to walk away really fast
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.100]   because those are going to be a complete waste of time.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.580]   It's not a sin to not get the deal.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.780]   This is a sin to take a long time to not get the deal.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.380]   Or it's a sin to take a long time to get a bad deal.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.060]   So I want to know, I'm going to try to figure out real quick
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.420]   whether or not is there a cutthroat
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.420]   on the other side of the table?
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.300]   Is it somebody I could trust?
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.840]   I'm leaning a little more inclined
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.260]   to dealing with the difficult people now
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.220]   as long as I don't give in.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.500]   So I want to diagnose early on what the possibilities are.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.520]   Now, if I'm curious, if I'm actually interested.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.580]   Now, another aspect of the mindset is
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.700]   like if I'm in a great mood,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.720]   like if I'm just going to be playful,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   a couple of really huge personal negotiation wins recently
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.600]   was when I was just trying to be playful.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.620]   I mean, I was just, I was in a great mood
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.220]   and I'm joking around.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.740]   And great negotiation is not exciting, it's astonishing.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.340]   We're in conversations right now
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.240]   with a possible non-scripted TV show.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.700]   And so I was telling the producers,
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.060]   you know, this ain't going to be Real Housewives.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.380]   To make this show properly,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.460]   there ain't going to be any screaming.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.660]   It's not going to be Bar Rescue
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.860]   where we're yelling at people.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.300]   We're not going to be Hell's Kitchen
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.100]   where we're yelling at people.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.920]   It's never going to be exciting,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.720]   but it is going to be astonishing.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.900]   Like you'll get outcomes where suddenly you find yourself
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.560]   in a place like, what in the world?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.060]   How did that just happen?
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.760]   And so I lose a suitcase in an airport the other day
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.720]   and I'm walking into the lost luggage place
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.340]   and I'm in a great mood because I'm home
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.540]   and I'm happy to be home.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.140]   And I'm going to get a good night's sleep.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.760]   And even though it's late in the day, I'm just happy.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.220]   And I get ready to walk into the lost luggage store
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.600]   where these people are battered children.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.220]   Like they expect you,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.400]   they know that you expect them to wave a magic wand
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.220]   and poof, your luggage is going to be there.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.100]   So for whatever reason, that's what I say
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.940]   when I walk in the door.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.620]   This young lady says, "How can I help you?"
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.380]   Well, first of all, how you could help me is obvious
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.380]   'cause I'm in a lost luggage.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.620]   There's only one reason I'm in here.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.380]   So that's kind of a silly question.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.260]   And I go, "I need you to wave a magic wand."
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.180]   And she just laughs and she looks at me.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.220]   She ends up walking me out to the carousel,
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.460]   climbing up on the carousel,
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.600]   and she walks down a ramp the luggage comes out of.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.860]   And I guarantee you, they're not supposed to do that.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.120]   And she sticks her head in, she looks around,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.220]   she comes back out.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.440]   And I've never seen any of these people leave the office,
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.700]   let alone walk back to the carousel.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.420]   And she says, "Wait here."
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.100]   And she disappears into the bowels of the airport,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.460]   which looks like a super highway down there, right?
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.500]   Like God knows what it looks like underneath the airport.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.940]   And pretty soon the carousel starts up again,
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.060]   and my bag and another bag pops out.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.500]   This other poor schmuck is sitting there waiting.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.940]   And I'm like, "I have never seen anybody do this, ever."
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.920]   Like normally they say,
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.240]   "Here's a number we'll call you in 24 hours.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.580]   It might show up at your house."
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.340]   And I look around, there's another young lady there,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.660]   and I say, "Please tell her thank you for me.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.860]   I gotta go, 'cause she doesn't come back out
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.820]   for like almost 10 minutes."
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.340]   And on my way out, she comes out the door
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.100]   and she high-fives me and she says,
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.300]   "How's that for waving a magic wand?"
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.500]   And that was the magic phrase,
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.020]   and I never would have said it to her
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.500]   if I wasn't playful in a moment.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.820]   And I've got a couple of others,
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.620]   like when I was just playful and I'm joking with people,
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.900]   almost at my expense, it's shocking, astonishing,
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.100]   where you can get people to do if you hit them the right way.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.040]   - So interesting.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.380]   I wonder what it tapped into,
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.300]   but it sounds like it might've tapped into her sense
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.500]   that everybody's always asking me for a magic wand
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.060]   kind of ability, but finally, somebody just said it directly
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.880]   and that would be kind of fun to actually play that role,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.020]   because normally they're restricted
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.860]   to their keyboard and their phone.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.760]   You know, I love that.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.740]   On the opposite side of that spectrum,
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.460]   if ever you're feeling tense, stressed, jet-lagged, angry,
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.780]   I can think about negotiations
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.940]   where like people are trying to keep their egos in check,
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.740]   they want to be right, you know, breakups, negotiations,
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.220]   there's not necessarily romantic breakups
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.980]   that could include that, but also professional breakups,
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.460]   you know, the dissolution of a contract
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.680]   or something like that.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.540]   Do you ever have to check yourself?
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.820]   Like, okay, I need to, I mean,
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.260]   I imagine being calm is better than not being calm
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.380]   for most all things.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.420]   Do you have a process of doing that?
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.180]   You seem like a pretty steady guy.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.240]   I've never seen you.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.060]   Overall, I'm pretty steady.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.180]   Well, the late night FM DJ voice
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.620]   that I'm not sure that I coined the phrase,
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.620]   but kind of famous for, to calm you down also calms me down.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.220]   So if I get bent out of shape,
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.340]   I will, and a conversation gets heated,
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.580]   I'll switch into that voice
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.700]   with the intention of calming you down.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.740]   'Cause you know, that's the hostage negotiator's voice,
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.540]   but it'll calm me down too.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.780]   Like intentionally going to that voice
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.180]   tamps down the negative emotions,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.500]   which I'm convinced make me dumber in the moment,
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.180]   interfere with my capacity to process information.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.660]   Got reasons for that, layman's reasons,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.300]   no scientific, academically rigorous studies
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.580]   that have been in any journals.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.780]   Well, after you're done, I'm gonna tell you something
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.160]   that will perhaps be astonishing to you
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.860]   as to why there's real neuroscience
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.920]   behind that late night FM DJ voice
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.800]   having an impact on other people's brains.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.580]   But yeah, and I'll do that 'cause it calms me down.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.640]   Now, if I can make the shift,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.620]   the hard part is to shift into a positive mindset.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.020]   If I can make that shift,
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.980]   but I can only make it from a calm voice.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.660]   I also think it's, the emotions are kind of
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.200]   a rock, paper, scissors sequence.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.760]   I don't think you can go from sadness to elation directly.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.220]   Sad, depressed, down.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.340]   I think there's something to getting angry
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.320]   to pull you out of sadness.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.420]   And I think if you're angry, you've gotta go to calm next.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.280]   And so, but if I can get out of anger and go to calm,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.320]   then I can say something to myself like,
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.880]   the reality is this is a luxury problem.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.080]   Or I was in a negotiation with a counterpart
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.660]   that I knew was deceiving, lying to me.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.080]   And I remember saying to myself,
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.040]   you know, I'm lucky to be in this negotiation.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.800]   I mean, they wouldn't be trying to hustle me
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.360]   if we weren't really good.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.680]   If we didn't have a product that was phenomenal.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.060]   I wouldn't be targeted at all.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.380]   So I'm actually lucky to be in this conversation.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.660]   So if I can make that next shift emotionally,
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.740]   then I'm good.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.540]   The hard part is making those shifts.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.060]   - I'm gonna just share with you what I learned recently
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.060]   about sound and emotion.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.900]   I'm researching an episode on music and the brain.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.600]   Fascinating topic.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.420]   Believe it or not, there's a lot known.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.240]   And the auditory system has this property
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.720]   where of course there are neurons, nerve cells
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.500]   that respond to different frequencies of sound.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.360]   Low frequency, you know, deeper tones and high frequency,
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.540]   squeals and that sort of thing.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.660]   Okay.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.020]   That's pretty straightforward.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.120]   Just like we have neurons that respond to different colors
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.620]   or different, you know, angles of light in the room.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.560]   But what I learned and I confirmed with a good friend of mine
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.000]   who's an auditory neuroscientist and neurosurgeon.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.840]   His name is Eddie Chang.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.680]   He was a guest on this podcast previously.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.680]   Is that low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.440]   that late night FM DJ voice are responded to in the brain
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.580]   by neurons, no surprise there.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.900]   But the frequency that those neurons fire
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.560]   is also low frequency.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   In other words, when you speak in your low voice,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.600]   the other person's brain hears that and starts firing
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.560]   in a low frequency tone.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.920]   In other words, it in trains to your voice,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.900]   not just the timing, but it's actually like,
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.780]   you're essentially playing an emotional piano
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.160]   down in the low keys of their mind.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.800]   Now, when you go up to the high frequencies,
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.520]   the neurons can't follow that high frequency.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.960]   So there's something special about low frequency sound
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.260]   that actually changes the emotional tone
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.800]   of the people that hear that low frequency sound.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.760]   This is wild, right?
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.160]   I mean, of course the content of the words matters too,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.960]   but anyway, there's real neuroscience to support the voice
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.800]   that you were endowed with
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.200]   and that you employed for your work.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   - Well then, and then also the point then too,
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.320]   is it's not, the other side is not making a choice.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.840]   It's an involuntary reaction.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.680]   - That's right.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.480]   This is not something one can override,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.200]   except by perhaps plugging their ears, right?
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.160]   If they're hearing that, their mind is getting shifted
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.920]   toward a state of low frequency oscillation,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.320]   which is one of more calm.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.480]   Yeah, so that's a real thing.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.400]   And were you to have a high squeaky chipmunks voice,
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.120]   you might not have been the negotiator.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.060]   You had all the, who knows,
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.680]   maybe there'd be another tactic there.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.460]   I mean, I think back to the,
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.240]   I guess it was during one of the Gulf War campaigns
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   where they, weren't they trying to squeeze out Saddam
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.000]   and some of his people by playing like Milli Vanilli
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.840]   at high volume for hours and hours.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.080]   Is that tactic actually used?
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   - So that was Panama when they were trying to get Noriega.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.960]   - Okay, so I'm only a few, I'm only a few countries over.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.920]   - See, you know, I get the trivia, you know,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.040]   I was telling you before, the wacky, fascinating,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.120]   useless information around terrorism and stuff like that.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   I tried that at Panama and for whatever the military guys,
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.840]   they were playing music and sounds.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.460]   And then also among the many stupid things
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.340]   that the FBI did at Waco, then late at night,
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.640]   they tried that in the Waco compound too.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   And it was just, that was one of the things
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.420]   that the hostage negotiators were adamantly against,
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.400]   adamantly against, but they got overruled
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.960]   by on scene command among the many stupid things
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.360]   that were done at Waco, that was also done at Waco.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.800]   It was stupid, it's counterproductive.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.200]   Hostage negotiators were always against it.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.720]   - So for those of you who don't remember Waco,
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.480]   Waco was Branch Davidian's David Koresh, right?
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.200]   - Yeah, there was a Netflix series that was out
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   about it recently that's fair about how it went down.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.120]   - Yeah, sad ending, he eventually set the building ablaze,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.780]   killed himself and everybody else in it.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.440]   - People inside set the building on fire.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.200]   - Yeah, including a lot of children perished.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.040]   - Including some children, there are some FBI agents
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.400]   that have still not gotten over that.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.480]   - I'd like to talk about some different types
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.680]   of negotiations.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:08.860]   Oftentimes, I think because you're a former FBI negotiator,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.740]   at a terrorist task force, this kind of thing,
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.800]   we tend to focus on the negative negotiations, right?
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.660]   Get the hostages away, and we'll talk about that stuff.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.200]   Breakups, business deals that have gone wrong,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.220]   people lying, cheating.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.200]   What about negotiations that are benevolent?
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   Let's say that two people want to come to a true win-win
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.800]   around what they each see to be their best interests
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   in, let's say, friendship.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.200]   Two friends taking a trip together on vacation.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.880]   Who's gonna pay for what?
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.120]   Who's gonna pay up front?
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.440]   Are people gonna pay each other back?
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.720]   Or a romantic relationship?
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.760]   Two people are considering fusing finances to some extent,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.920]   or moving in together.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.880]   What sorts of questions should people be asking themselves
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.960]   prior to those negotiations?
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.280]   In particular, is it very important that people know
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.500]   exactly what they want going into a negotiation?
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.440]   Or I can recall many times
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.140]   when I've gone into life circumstances,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.860]   knowing I wanted a certain set of feelings or outcomes,
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.920]   but not being extremely specific about,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.700]   I want this salary, I want to live in a West-facing house
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.700]   on this particular location, an exploration of potentials,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.140]   I think can also take the form of negotiation.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.780]   So how should people think about
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.940]   approaching benevolent negotiations?
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.180]   Like where we're not talking about something tragic
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.600]   happening if it doesn't go through.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.540]   It might hurt, it might be a little bit high friction,
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.440]   but let's talk about how to get to a win-win.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.780]   - Yeah, well, there's a couple of interesting things there.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.660]   First of all, the phrase win-win.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.580]   Because win-win is just great collaboration.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.500]   I mean, important fact, it should be win-win,
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.620]   which might only be emotional win-win.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.860]   Now, the phraseology win-win,
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.460]   I know that if someone opens a negotiation with me
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.680]   and they say right off the bat,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.180]   look, I want to do a win-win deal with you,
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.420]   that correlates extremely highly
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.620]   with someone who's trying to pick my pocket.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.740]   So if you use that phrase in the first five minutes,
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.820]   I already know where you're coming from.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.140]   You're trying to get me to drop my guard.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.440]   It's you win, I lose.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.720]   So, and this came up on an Instagram post
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.300]   I put up recently, which is essentially
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.500]   watch out for the person that says win-win.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.740]   Now, I didn't say win-win is bad.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.980]   I said watch out for the person that says it.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:48.180]   Also, you gotta be cautious if you like,
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.620]   some of the win-win mindset,
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.300]   then people set themselves up to just get slaughtered
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.100]   by the person who's expressing a desire for win-win
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.060]   and looking to pick their pocket.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.620]   Like if I feel win-win in my heart,
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.220]   you go, let's do a win-win deal.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.260]   If I don't watch it, I'm like, okay, what do you want?
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.220]   And then I find myself giving away the store.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.140]   So there's a lot behind the win-win phraseology
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.360]   that you have to have a complete understanding of.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.800]   In point of fact,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.980]   both sides should feel good about the outcome.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.180]   And isn't that the definition of win-win?
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.340]   Well, kinda, sorta.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.460]   But it's how they feel about it
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.240]   more than really what they got.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:31.020]   So in a benevolent negotiation among friends,
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.620]   where are we gonna go to eat?
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.940]   Where are we going on vacation?
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.340]   What route are we gonna take?
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.460]   People really just wanna be heard out
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.660]   more than anything else,
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.120]   which operationally seems to be,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.780]   I don't understand how it's gonna make any difference.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.740]   Makes all the difference in the world.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.220]   And what's the best way for somebody to feel heard out?
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.560]   Well, I'm gonna start out by telling you,
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.340]   describing to you, not telling you,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.900]   but describing to you
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.500]   what my best guess is on your perspective.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.460]   Because it's really calibrating me
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.620]   actually finding out what your position is.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.820]   And the only way I can find out
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.200]   what your position actually is,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.480]   I'm gonna increase you telling me
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.300]   if I start taking a guess at it first.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.780]   'Cause you're immediately, right away,
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.780]   you're immediately gonna tell me
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.020]   either I'm right or I'm wrong.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.860]   You're gonna correct me.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.860]   Correction is a satisfying thing to do.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.620]   And you're gonna be much more candid with me
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.920]   if you're correcting me than if I'm asking you.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.340]   And you'll feel good about correcting me.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.800]   So there's all these great emotional lubricants
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.260]   to me getting you to correct me.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.260]   So I'm gonna start out by saying,
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.740]   "Here's what I think you're thinking.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.800]   "Here's how I think you're approaching this.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.540]   "Here's what I think you're wanting out of this."
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.920]   Not what you should be,
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.060]   but what you probably are based on your perspective.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.040]   And that's gonna accelerate the conversation exponentially.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.100]   Like it's ridiculous how much faster things are gonna go.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.640]   And then it becomes both an information gathering
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.820]   and a rapport building process simultaneously
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.140]   instead of separately.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.260]   Which is what makes this approach faster,
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.340]   even though it seems more indirect.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.500]   So if we're getting ready to,
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.740]   let's say you and I are gonna take a car trip
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.580]   to San Francisco from here.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.500]   And I'm gonna say, "All right, so my guess is
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.980]   "you want to take the most direct route
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.460]   "because you hate wasting time."
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.840]   And you're probably gonna say to me,
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.680]   "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.040]   "I want to go up the Pacific Coast Highway
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.260]   "because there's a beautiful stretch of country.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.940]   "I realize it's gonna be a waste of time
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.240]   "if we go up the Pacific Coast
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.440]   "'cause we got to jump off it at some point,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.960]   "but I really want to see the scenery."
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.740]   You would have, I've taken a guess of what you want
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.260]   and you're gonna come back real quick and correct me.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.780]   And then maybe I'm thinking time on the trip,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.420]   but I've forgotten how beautiful it is to roll up the coast.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.320]   And so when you throw that out, I'll be like,
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.580]   "Oh yeah, it is a beautiful ride."
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.980]   And we might not get another shot.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.460]   Like who knows what's gonna happen?
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.800]   So yeah, now that we're having a conversation,
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.260]   I'd rather run up the Pacific Coast Highway
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.680]   before we go inland and make the trip.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.960]   And that's how we get to,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.120]   we collaborate for a better outcome,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.300]   maybe a better idea than what I had in mind
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.720]   in the first place.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.620]   - I love that because what you just described
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.100]   is hypothesis testing.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.940]   - Yes.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.960]   - It's the way scientists are trained.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.040]   Many people don't know this, but they teach us in science,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.860]   not to ask questions, but to start with a question,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.680]   like how does the brain develop or something?
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.540]   And then you say a hypothesis and you test hypotheses
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.900]   and then you figure out if they're right or wrong.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.440]   And that takes you through a set of decision trees
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.280]   and you eventually get at what you hope is some core truth.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.700]   And then hopefully others arrive there as well
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.840]   and you get a consensus.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.760]   So I love the idea of hypothesis testing.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.240]   In fact, when you said take the most direct route
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.660]   from where we are now in Los Angeles to San Francisco,
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.120]   I like to take one-on-one, not the five, the five is faster.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.520]   So I immediately think, but I like one-on-one.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.500]   First of all, there are a couple of really great taco
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.760]   and hamburger spots along the way
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.800]   that I used to stop with my bulldog.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.840]   Also, you get to see it the coast
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.580]   and it makes those extra two hours completely worth it.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.360]   And so you're exactly right.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.320]   And in that working through the decision tree
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.980]   doesn't necessarily mean presuming
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.460]   that the hypothesis is right.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.160]   It sounds like you'd be equally okay
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.440]   with the hypothesis being wrong
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.920]   because really what you're trying to do is just learn.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.320]   And in learning, set up this collaboration.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.140]   I love that.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.980]   - A couple of things.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.160]   First of all, when you talk about hypothesis,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.080]   when my son Brandon was involved in a company,
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.580]   he's out on his own now,
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.240]   but he used to always say hypothesis, test your hypothesis.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.680]   He always used that term.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.880]   And then even now, like if we were talking about it
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.760]   and you just said, you knew some hot dog
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.680]   and hamburger places, I'd be like, holy cow.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.080]   I didn't even know that.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.540]   Yeah, I want to check those places out.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.460]   So that's how you discover new stuff in a conversation.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.300]   - I love it.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.300]   So, and also I've been sure people are noting
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.800]   to not say the words win-win
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.260]   when approaching any kind of negotiation.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.780]   What do you think it is about those little catchphrases
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.260]   that signal lack of authenticity or trustworthiness?
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.680]   Because you could imagine that somebody,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.660]   I come to you and say, hey, Chris,
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.500]   let's do some collaborative thing for social media,
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.760]   for podcasts, and this is going to be a win-win
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.600]   for both of us.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.560]   Now I know to never say that with you,
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.960]   but you could imagine that somebody really means that.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.260]   But for you, it sounds like it's a flag
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.900]   that they're trying to pull one over.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.200]   - It correlates really strongly with the people
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.500]   that are definitely trying to cut your throat.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.660]   And I've had them admit that to me candidly.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.480]   - Amazing.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.540]   - Like I'll be, I've experienced it.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.360]   Like if somebody throws win-win out early to me,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.840]   I'll say, all right, I think I know where this is going,
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.920]   but let me explore it.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.560]   And they'll say, yeah, you know,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.980]   this is a great opportunity for you.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.080]   That's another top.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.700]   And we're going to put you in a room
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.840]   with all these billionaires,
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.580]   and there's going to be all this opportunity for you
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.000]   if you just come in and speak.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.240]   And you know, we don't have a budget.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.720]   - Yeah, well, I've gotten that one before.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.560]   - Yeah.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.040]   - The famous, the World War would just work out
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.080]   in your favor because it's going to work out in my favor.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.320]   - Right, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.560]   - Exactly, right, exactly.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   - I've been on the receiving end of those offers
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.580]   many a time.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.640]   Fascinating.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.920]   Conversely, what sorts of openers
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.400]   do you think established the best rapport
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.720]   and, you know, benevolent discovery of a topic?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.840]   - Well, what I'm seeing correlates real strongly
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.320]   with people I want to do business with.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.480]   If they figured out something that they know
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.640]   is valuable for me and they've just done it,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.160]   and they've just offered it, like right off the bat.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.560]   No strings attached.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.600]   They found a way to drop something on me that's valuable.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.020]   They didn't approach me with their hand out.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.200]   They approached me with some sort of generosity.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.380]   Like a friend of mine, Joe Polish,
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.480]   runs this outfit called Genius Network.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.520]   Joe says life gives to the giver.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.040]   Like Joe did a bunch of favors for me before I ever joined.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.520]   And he was trying to help me out and get my book sold.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.480]   And he asked me to come in and speak.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   And he'd done a, he'd emphasized my book on his podcast
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.080]   and in different conversations.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.720]   And I, you know, I finally paid the fee to join.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.480]   'Cause he had done so much for me.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.280]   Like there's not much Joe could ask me for right now.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.760]   'Cause he's done so much for me that he gets a blanket
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.840]   pretty much, yes, right away, what do you want?
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.680]   What do you need?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.360]   'Cause he's just generous.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.680]   And the generosity approach, universally,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.120]   I'm seeing a lot of really successful people
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.440]   that lead by generosity.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.200]   And so if you start out that, you know,
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.320]   if you give me a five star review of the book on Amazon,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.700]   no strings attached or anything.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.080]   Like that goes a long, long way to somebody
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.120]   who wants to establish a long-term relationship
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.060]   and collaboration.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.560]   - When I first opened my laboratory in 2011,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.880]   I had a technician at the time
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.720]   who had been a technician for a lot of years.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.760]   And there's this culture in science of people
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.880]   borrowing things from laboratories
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.840]   and not giving them back or breaking them.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.680]   These can be little things like a, you know,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.940]   a small instrument or a forceps.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.960]   But you know, as a student or a postdoc,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.080]   these are the things that you covet,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.760]   like a really nice pair of forceps.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.120]   It's like a great thing, you know.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.900]   You drop them once, they're not good anymore, by the way.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's like, you have to treat them with respect.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.840]   Surgical tools have to be treated with respect.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.760]   These are very fine instruments.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.880]   And people used to come by our lab all the time
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.120]   and borrow stuff from us.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.080]   And he'd always lend it out.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.440]   And I was like, what are you doing?
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.840]   But anytime I went to go borrow something,
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.700]   he'd say, do not borrow anything from anybody else
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.580]   because then we're gonna owe them.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.000]   Right now, everybody owes us everything.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.440]   And I was like, you're running up our budget,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.360]   giving away these instruments.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.480]   They come back with the forceps, dented and stuff.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.160]   And he said, just trust me, this is the way to do it.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.560]   And I don't recall ever quote unquote,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.200]   cashing in on any of that, but he was exactly right.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.540]   When I eventually decided to move institutions,
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:31.080]   we'd given away so much and we had asked for so very little,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.400]   maybe nothing that when you leave a place,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.420]   typically there can be a little bad blood.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.800]   And all we got was sorry to see you go kind of stuff.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.200]   Had it been me, I would have been in a kind of a,
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.680]   an exchange of, oh, we ask for things, we give things.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.520]   It's kind of a neighborhood.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.000]   I grew up in a neighborhood where you'd borrow eggs or milk
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.040]   from the neighbor, remember those days?
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.640]   I don't know if people do that any longer.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.240]   But I think it falls well into what you're describing
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   that when you just do things for people out of goodness,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.680]   then sure you sort of have a history
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.440]   where you could return to that they owe you,
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.960]   but there's also just something good
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.920]   about just doing things out of goodness
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.800]   and also not asking for so much
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.160]   and expecting people to provide that.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.960]   So I love that.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.820]   And I actually, I love providing good reviews
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.920]   for things I like.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.120]   I get on the phone when, you know, the airline,
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.120]   that we don't do this anymore.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.960]   We book our own flights,
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.560]   but anytime I get help on the phone
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.740]   and, you know, if it's really great help,
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.520]   I'll say, how can I help?
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.760]   And they'll say, oh, it would mean a lot
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.120]   if you would send an email to this, to my business,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.640]   just saying, I did a great job or something like that.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.920]   And I actually really enjoy doing that.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.280]   So I love the points you're making
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.880]   because they're very actionable.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.720]   As many of you know,
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.400]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.840]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.160]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.000]   that's designed to meet
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.240]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.840]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.140]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.400]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.060]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.040]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.800]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.960]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.760]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.280]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.520]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.400]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.080]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.760]   I answer, AG1.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.480]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.940]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.700]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.360]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.800]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.260]   Shifting slightly into the more,
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.460]   let's call them high friction negotiations
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.980]   or the types of negotiations where there is the potential
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.600]   for a truly bad outcome.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.400]   I know you've been asked this before,
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.900]   but some of our listeners are going to be learning about you
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.260]   for the first time.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.020]   Do you recall of the many negotiations that you did
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.580]   while in the FBI, any one particular negotiation
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.460]   that felt like if this doesn't work out,
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.740]   this is really catastrophic?
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.660]   And would you be willing to share that with us?
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.660]   - Well, I learned,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.400]   you know, they try to teach this early on
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.340]   that not everything's going to work out.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.780]   And the second negotiation I had in the Philippines,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.120]   the first one, a young man named Jeff Schilling
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.620]   was grabbed by a terrorist group at Busayef.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.900]   And he ended up walking away
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.180]   'cause we stole the bad guys long enough
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:47.060]   that we just, you know, sometimes if you can slow it down,
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.940]   you wait for something good to fall out of the sky.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.000]   And it will.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.820]   And that ended up happening in that case.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.660]   And a bad guy ends up calling the negotiator
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.020]   that I coached on the phone after it was over
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.700]   to basically tell them
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.740]   that they still had a good relationship.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.880]   It was nuts.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.540]   Why does a bad guy call the negotiator
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.180]   that is responsible for him losing everything
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.180]   and say, you know, you did a good job,
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.740]   which is exactly what happened.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.180]   So we roll into a case,
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.300]   and I hadn't had anything go bad at that point in time.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.700]   The very next case, a Burnham-Sibero case
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.820]   by a different faction of the terrorist group,
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.820]   13 months later, ends up in two or three remaining hostages,
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.880]   shot and killed by friendly fire.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.980]   Along the way, hostages have been executed,
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.860]   an American had been executed early on,
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.460]   and it was a train wreck,
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.860]   and lots of people got killed all along the way,
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.060]   and just really ridiculous bad things happening.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.140]   And that was bad all the way through.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.240]   So we learned, you know, learned a lot from it.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.820]   Went back and checked everything we did,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.540]   and we didn't do anything wrong
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.680]   that we felt, based on our strategy, didn't miss anything,
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.940]   and that was why I ended up going,
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.380]   collaborating with the guys at Harvard,
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.940]   because my reaction was if we did everything we know
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.020]   how to do and it wasn't enough,
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.240]   that means we're not smart enough, we gotta get better.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.460]   And so that case taught me a lot
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:26.100]   about the dynamics that really happened on the other side,
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.640]   and the difference between, you know,
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.760]   whether or not people are really on your side.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.060]   The U.S. government was not highly collaborative.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.100]   The Philippine government was not highly collaborative.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.400]   That everybody wanted to get their pound of flesh
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.880]   out of the other side.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.080]   I mean, just everything bad that you can imagine.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.440]   Early on, when Guillermo Saburo was murdered
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.140]   by the Abu Sayyaf,
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.100]   it was a national holiday in the Philippines.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.400]   And the bad guys had a history
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.100]   of killing people on national holidays.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.680]   And we weren't from the Philippines,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.520]   and we had no idea that that day was a national holiday.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.560]   And we showed up
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.580]   at Philippine National Police Headquarters in Manila,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.160]   and it was closed.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.880]   Now, I got an ongoing hostage case
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.420]   with bad guys threatening to kill hostages,
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.680]   and we show up at the gates, and the gates are closed.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.760]   And we're like, what the hell's going on here?
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.760]   And it was a national holiday, nobody's working today.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.480]   I'm like, first of all, nobody told us that.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   Secondly, I don't think the bad guys really care
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.320]   that it's a national holiday and nobody's working.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.600]   Our negotiators, nowhere to be found.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   We got a guy there that,
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.960]   the previous negotiator we worked with,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.400]   Philippine National Police was not that happy
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.040]   that they didn't have him under complete control.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.120]   So they give us a guy that will not tell us anything
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.140]   until after he's told them.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.200]   So he's having conversations with the bad guys,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.840]   and we're actually hearing about him secondhand.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.480]   He didn't show up that day.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.120]   And then, of course, that day,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.360]   the bad guys announce they're gonna kill a hostage
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.460]   and give it as a gift to the country of the Philippines
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.160]   'cause it's a holiday.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   And then go, oh, by the way,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.480]   they like doing this on holidays.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.240]   And so, and Guillermo Saburo ended up
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.480]   getting his head cut off.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   Because of all the warring factions on our side of the table
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.580]   not telling each other what the hell's going on.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.180]   So I had assumed at that point in time
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.380]   that people would tell us the stuff we need to know,
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.260]   we didn't need to ask.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.700]   And after that, I got like,
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.140]   look, there ain't nothing here that I don't need to know.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.440]   I don't, if it's a holiday, it's coming up,
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.560]   then you assume I know.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.680]   You gotta tell us.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.960]   So really learned a lot about collaboration
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.940]   on our side of the table,
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.900]   and also the lack of collaboration
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.920]   on the other side of the table.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   Just 'cause we're a mess
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.180]   doesn't mean they got their act together,
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.500]   and the bad guys didn't have their act together.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.200]   And ultimately the hostages,
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.640]   one of the reasons someone didn't come out
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.420]   because internally they had double-crossed each other.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.160]   So learned a lot about what really fundamental
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.000]   human nature dynamics are on teams,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.400]   and your team has not got its act together,
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.800]   and the other team does not either.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.280]   So what can you do as a communicator to make up for that?
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.440]   Really learned a lot about that in that case.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.780]   I had cases subsequent to that involving Al-Qaeda
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.880]   when Al-Qaeda was killing people on a regular basis.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.440]   But we saw those coming,
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.920]   and we did everything we could do
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.600]   to keep the train from smashing into us.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.240]   You see a train coming down the tracks,
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.560]   you know it's coming down the tracks,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.640]   and you do the best you can to derail it,
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.840]   and sometimes you can't.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.760]   - I've heard it said that
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.080]   when people take somebody captive
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.400]   that they either want their money,
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.280]   their body, or their life,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.100]   or some combination of those.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.840]   - Yeah, that's probably one of those three.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.940]   Yeah, that's very true.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:01.120]   - And as the negotiator trying to rescue the hostage,
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.540]   is it important to identify early on
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.540]   which of those three or which all of those three
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.540]   they're after, like how serious they are?
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.400]   Are they willing to actually kill the hostage?
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.420]   Are they, you know, will they go for any amount of money
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.740]   above X number of dollars?
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.140]   Trying to figure out their threshold, right?
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.220]   I mean, because the person is on the other side
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.060]   is gambling, right?
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.000]   They're gambling their freedom,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.700]   they're gambling their reputation
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.860]   with whoever their reputation matters to.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.580]   Is it important to get into the mindset
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.220]   of the person you're negotiating with quickly
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.620]   using the hypothesis generating method?
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.860]   And if so, could you give an example
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.300]   of how that played out in your previous work?
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.140]   - Yeah, the indicators are really there.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.740]   I mean, once you sort of lose your illusions
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.620]   about how you think things should play out,
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.880]   then the patterns of behavior
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.120]   are generally pretty quick and clear.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.980]   And just 'cause you don't like the patterns,
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.340]   like with Al-Qaeda, we recognize the patterns
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.500]   and knowing what they are
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.380]   doesn't mean you can change what they are.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.820]   And Al-Qaeda in 2004's timeframe
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.180]   was very clear about killing people on deadline.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.700]   And we had to recognize that.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.880]   So there becomes a pattern of behavior
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.620]   and it's usually specificity in what they say.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.840]   And this is all human nature.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.180]   Like if you're in a business negotiation
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.260]   and they say, you know,
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.520]   we're gonna do something horrible here.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.060]   You know, we're gonna walk out.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.620]   You know, that's fairly non-specific.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.540]   And if they say, look, if we don't get this
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.280]   by this specific deadline,
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.140]   if we don't get these specific things met
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.860]   by this specific time, that's pretty specific.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.540]   It's specificity, you're looking for it.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.380]   I learned to look forward in kidnapping negotiations.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.400]   We're working a case again in the Philippines.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.460]   And the bad guys say, you know,
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.300]   if we don't get a ransom for the son,
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.560]   17-year-old boy at the time is kidnapped,
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.640]   you know, you tell his father he's gonna lose an egg.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.520]   And that's a euphemism for losing a child.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.600]   And early on, when that threat came through
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.400]   on our side of the table, everybody's like,
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.560]   oh my God, they're gonna kill him.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.800]   You know, this is really bad.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.760]   We gotta make sure the family can pay the ransom.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.080]   I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.800]   It didn't say when it was gonna happen.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   They didn't say how it was gonna happen.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.140]   They didn't say who was gonna do it.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.940]   You know, the basic specificity of who, what, when and where.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.140]   Like, they left themselves an out here, a very clear out.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.860]   And we never said we were gonna do it.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.640]   We never said when it was gonna happen.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.720]   We never said which child.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.160]   You know what, they're just trying to scare you.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.440]   They're throwing out something vague.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.020]   I said, we got plenty of time to play with this.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.520]   We gotta push this all the way through the process
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.360]   and to the end.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.040]   Now, later on in that case,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.480]   when the family tried to deliver a ransom
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.760]   and it was screwed up by God knows who,
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.460]   the bad guys came up back on the phone
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.400]   and they said, if we don't get paid tomorrow, your son dies.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.800]   And I said, all right, now that's specific.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.840]   And these guys sound like they mean it.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.160]   And so we're gonna have to make sure
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.800]   this thing goes down tomorrow
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.200]   or that's the end of this kid.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.920]   And at that point in time, we allowed the family,
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.440]   we were in a position to allow or disallow.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.760]   We were in a position to offer thoughts
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.480]   and our thoughts were they mean it now
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.260]   and you need to do something now
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.480]   or likely something bad's gonna happen.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.920]   And now that they're this serious,
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.080]   'cause you always gotta worry about
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.800]   what we used to refer to as a double dip.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.680]   Do they take the money and they come back and say,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.100]   nah, that was a down payment.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.520]   That wasn't the ransom.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.640]   That was just a down payment.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.240]   You gotta make sure you don't get double dipped
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.720]   if you let the family pay.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.000]   And you gotta give them your honest opinion
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.640]   as to whether or not they're gonna let the hostage go
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.860]   if you pay now.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:15.520]   And our thoughts were, you pay them tomorrow,
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.920]   your son's coming out.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.760]   And he did.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.580]   - The double dip is a scary thing to hear about.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:27.540]   At a much lower level, meaning more minor level,
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.040]   people sometimes get shaken down online.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.720]   You know, like their password will get taken.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.920]   There are people everywhere who go
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.160]   for the click on this link.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   You know, you'll get a text message.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.520]   You know, we've identified that your account has,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.060]   you know, in change, verify.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.440]   You click on the link, takes you someplace
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.620]   where you put in your login and password and boom, it's gone.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.000]   And then they try and sell it back to you,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.360]   typically through cryptocurrency because it's not traceable.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.760]   - By the way, those negotiations can be a lot of fun
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.600]   if you let them.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.280]   - Well, I'm hoping that our discussion about this now
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.360]   is going to save some people the trouble
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.140]   of having their accounts hacked.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.840]   I've known people who've had their accounts hacked.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.880]   And these are some smart people.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   But what's interesting is that I've also observed
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.000]   those situations where somebody gets to the point
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.840]   where they just say, you know,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.480]   I'm just going to give them what they want.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.580]   And I remember in this one particular instance saying,
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.100]   no, no, no, do not give them the money
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.960]   because then they're just going to say they want more.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.400]   There's no guarantee that they're going to give you back
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.720]   what you want and why would they, right?
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.760]   If you think about it, why would they?
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.040]   The money funnels in and like,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.160]   they just can pivot and go to the next thing.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.800]   So how do you gain confidence
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.740]   that you are likely to be double-dipped or not?
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.560]   - Well, first of all, I got to find out
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.380]   if they're in a position to carry out the threat
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.040]   or if they're in any sort of legitimate position
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.880]   to begin with.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.740]   You know, for lack of a better term, it's proof of life.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.880]   And there are a lot of people that are trying to scam you,
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.400]   but they don't really have the ability to scam you.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.060]   So you got to find out, you know, do some confirmation.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.880]   Do they have access to your account?
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.160]   Do they have your data?
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.140]   Do they have your money?
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.540]   Do they have it in a position
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.880]   or are they just trying to make you believe
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.520]   that they have that position of influence on you?
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.420]   There are a lot of the bad guys out there
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.220]   that are just rolling a dice,
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.720]   dialing for dollars, if you will.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.100]   And if they don't scam you,
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.560]   when they have no leverage on you,
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.040]   they'll find somebody else that'll give in.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.440]   So there's a bit of, you know, authenticity
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.480]   or are they in a position to do it?
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   And the same rule applies in any negotiation.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.660]   The other side is gonna give in
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.820]   when they feel like they've gotten everything they can.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:44.240]   Kidnappers, I'd be asked by an ambassador,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.580]   asked by an FBI commander, when's this gonna be over?
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:47.800]   When the bad guys feel like
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.140]   they've gotten everything they could.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:53.340]   Not when they did, but when they felt like they did.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.160]   So our job is just make them feel it sooner.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.780]   So, you know, how hard do you make it?
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.560]   Innocently on the other side.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.200]   Everybody wants to feel like they did a,
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.400]   they got a good day's pay for a good day's work.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.420]   So if you let them feel like they're in charge
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.680]   and you make 'em work by asking 'em innocent
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.340]   how and what questions,
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.760]   which are very hard and fatiguing to answer,
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.520]   then you're gonna get to the point
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.120]   where you're gonna get a solid outcome
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.300]   where you don't get double-dipped
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.680]   and they're gonna be happy that it's over
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.360]   'cause they felt like they got everything they could.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.920]   It could be your data, could be your bank account,
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.300]   could be anything.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.440]   The other side is gonna be satisfied with the outcome
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.960]   when they feel like they've worked for it.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.240]   And in business negotiations, you're selling your car
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.800]   and some, you put a price tag on your car
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.960]   and the guy walks up to you and says,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.920]   "I'll give you full amount right now."
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.760]   What's your reaction?
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.120]   I should've asked for more.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.880]   Maybe I won't sell my car.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.460]   Every human interaction, the other side wants to feel like
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.520]   that they earned what they got.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:12.360]   And so the idea of empathy in hostage negotiations
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.560]   is really just to make 'em feel that sooner.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.000]   - We're gonna come back to empathy
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.460]   because it's such a big and important topic.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.900]   But I've heard it said before that
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.720]   if somebody you don't know,
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.800]   but maybe also somebody you know,
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   places a real sense of urgency on need the money now,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.840]   or I need you to do something right away or else,
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.280]   not a threat of physical violence,
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   but that any request for expediting something is a red flag
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.440]   that it's likely to be a scam.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.600]   Very seldom do you need to click on the link
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.040]   within 24 hours, right?
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.960]   I mean, how could that possibly be, right?
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.080]   But that's one way in which people are exploited,
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:06.680]   that some requests comes in by phone or by email or text
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.200]   or maybe even person.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.120]   Somebody says, "You need to do this right now
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.480]   "or else something bad is gonna happen."
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.320]   Capture people's sense of urgency,
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.880]   get them to make a mistake,
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.260]   and then they're left reeling
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.480]   because that request for something right now or else,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.160]   I think hits a fundamental nerve in us.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.240]   - Yeah, they wanna help, to be a rescuer.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.160]   - Right.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.680]   So is that a good rule of thumb for people to keep in mind?
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.520]   To not--
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.060]   - I think that's a great rule of thumb.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.640]   I mean, a friend of mine,
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.180]   somebody got a hold of his phone number not that long ago,
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.200]   and I was getting texts from his number.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.500]   So I'm like, "Look, man, I got some real problems.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.540]   "Look, I need some money from you now."
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.660]   It was a friend, a friend's number.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.600]   And I remember when I first saw it,
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.920]   actually, when I first saw it, I was really busy,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.160]   and I felt bad that I didn't get back to him that day.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.080]   And then I didn't hear from him again,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.400]   and so I thought, "Well, whatever it was,
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.980]   "you worked it out."
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.360]   So a couple weeks later, I get the text again.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.560]   You got a real problem,
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.700]   you gotta get back to me right now.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.700]   So I decide, "If it's really my buddy,
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.320]   "I am gonna help him right now.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.160]   "I gotta make sure it's really my buddy."
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.360]   And I said, "Hey, man, you didn't raise this at all
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.300]   "last time I saw you in Vegas,
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.360]   "'cause I'd seen him in Vegas recently."
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.000]   And he's like, "Yeah, I was busy, I couldn't bring it up."
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And something like ours,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.740]   so there's no direct confirmation or denial.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.720]   We had breakfast together in Vegas.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.200]   So then I shoot back, I say like,
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.720]   "And man, I gotta tell you something,
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.260]   "that was such a crazy night,
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.560]   "and I still owe you money from them.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.240]   "So that night when we were gambling,
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.320]   "I still owe you money, I'm happy to help."
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.640]   Now, it wasn't a crazy night, it was breakfast,
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.440]   and I didn't owe him money.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.040]   And his next response was like,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.340]   "Yeah, don't worry about it,
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.180]   "you can make that up to me with this."
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.880]   So I'm like, "All right, cool."
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.460]   So now I start making stuff up.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.080]   And I said, "And when we were with those strippers,
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:10.240]   "and that dog and the clown and the pony,
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.600]   "I'll never get over that."
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.880]   And so now the guy's, "What are you talking about?"
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.720]   And I said, "By the way," and then I started
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.400]   throwing in some stuff about his wife and his mother,
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.360]   and the guy got insulted and called me names
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.880]   and stopped texting me.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.120]   And then I sent all those text messages to the real guy,
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.320]   including what I'd said about his mother,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.520]   and he texted me back, he's got a great sense of humor,
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.600]   he says, "By the way, my mom does think you're attractive."
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.080]   - Oh man, I think--
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.680]   - But I started it all by just checking the source.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.120]   If it was my friend, I would have helped him immediately.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.080]   And I need to throw something at him
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.380]   that's gonna confirm that it's him,
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.720]   and that I'm there for him.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.700]   But I'm also gonna put a little bit of a curve in there
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:59.460]   that if he doesn't catch, I know it's a con.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.760]   And then I'm gonna have fun with it.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.960]   - Incredible knowledge that, you know,
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.260]   people will hear this and they might think,
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.000]   "Oh, you know, that's never gonna happen to me."
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.300]   But like I said, I had known family members and friends
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.520]   who, they make the mistake, they take the bait
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.560]   of clicking on the link,
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.660]   and then now they're getting the shakedown.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.140]   Actually, a good friend of mine said
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.300]   that her parents called at some point,
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.740]   her parents are probably in their late 70s now,
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:31.020]   someone had called their house and told them
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.020]   that their child, this woman, had been kidnapped
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.460]   and that they needed to send money.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.540]   And that if they called the police,
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.980]   they'd kill her or harm her in some way.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.140]   So they started sending money
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.480]   and they were afraid to contact her.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.220]   And you can see what a bind a loving parent would be in.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:55.060]   They obviously don't want to get this child of theirs hurt.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.580]   And they obviously are willing to do whatever it takes
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.400]   in order to get them back.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.900]   Turns out it was total scam
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.580]   because eventually there was communication
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.180]   that made them realize that their daughter was perfectly okay
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.460]   and never even interacted with kidnappers.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.620]   So those kinds of scams happen pretty often.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.460]   - I've had that happen to a friend also.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.260]   - Yeah, so the sense of urgency
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.180]   should have been the first flag.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.820]   - That's a great point.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.140]   And look, even if they've got your loved one,
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.760]   the secondary issue is if you do what they want,
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.820]   are they gonna let them go?
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.620]   Which is actually a legitimate question.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.220]   Like if there really are bad guys,
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.720]   one of the things we learned in hostage negotiation
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.460]   that I applied to business negotiation,
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.060]   there are legitimate questions that it's okay to ask.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.780]   You're not being disrespectful.
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.180]   You're not pushing back.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:52.740]   There are fair, to use the F bomb,
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.840]   fair legitimate questions that you can ask
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.380]   under any circumstances, which is basically,
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.260]   if I comply, is this gonna work out the way
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.380]   that you're articulating it?
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.560]   Anything that adds communication into it,
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.740]   which gives you more information
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.540]   to find out what the ultimate outcome looks like,
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.200]   even in kidnappings.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.880]   How do you know that if you pay, they're gonna let them go?
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.340]   That's a legitimate question.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.140]   - There are examples somewhere in between
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.900]   getting your Instagram account hacked,
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.140]   your bank account hacked,
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:33.420]   and God forbid, your child kidnapped.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.980]   For instance, there's a whole practice within
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:42.720]   the legal profession of probing to see whether or not
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.160]   somebody is gonna give up money
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.120]   to avoid a lawsuit, for instance.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.840]   Actually, a lawyer friend of mine recently
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.000]   described their job very well.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.120]   He said, in his words, first person,
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.760]   he said, "I scare people for money."
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.840]   The operative word being scare people.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.800]   - And that's being honest.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.940]   - Yeah, he's being very honest.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.160]   He scares people for money and he's very good at it.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.300]   And he understands how other people scare people for money
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.820]   and he works both sides,
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.360]   plaintiff for defense type situations.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.940]   But it made me realize that a lot of the legal profession
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.540]   is not, okay, the lawsuit slid across the table.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.600]   It's the, okay, here's what the lawsuit would look like.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.120]   Here are all the statutes that potentially were violated.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.100]   And then there's a probe of what somebody's finances are
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.600]   and how much they're willing to pay
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.920]   and do they have liability insurance?
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.160]   Do they have an umbrella policy?
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.400]   All the sorts of things that are really,
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.820]   it's not necessarily an illegal shakedown,
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:39.240]   but it's a probing as to whether or not
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.020]   it's worth the effort.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.480]   - Diagnosing the other side's ability to pay.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.160]   - And so that happens really often.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.560]   I can give a specific example
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.560]   where somebody had a incident at a dog park
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:58.000]   where their dog allegedly ran into somebody,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.520]   maybe charged at somebody.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.200]   You know, dog park people are standing around
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.160]   and the person moved and apparently injured their knee.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.360]   But rather than sue the owner of the dog,
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.680]   what they typically do is deliver some set of documents
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.760]   that say, you know, I was injured,
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.840]   your dog was responsible for this.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.080]   And if you don't settle up for X number of dollars,
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:23.960]   you're going to be sued
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.920]   for usually an exorbitant amount above that.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.000]   And then there's this question
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.520]   that the lawyers have to figure out,
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.880]   like, is it puffery, right?
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   Are they saying, well, I'm going to sue you
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.000]   for $4 million, is there any basis for that?
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.880]   And good lawyers will say, that's puffery.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.160]   They're trying to scare you with a big number.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.560]   But a lot of people see that number and go,
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.900]   oh my goodness, what do they want?
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.880]   You know what, like, I don't even know if they were injured.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.520]   If they were, that's terrible, I'd want that taken care of.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.800]   If my dog's responsible, I'd want that taken care of.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.200]   But what do they need in order to make this go away?
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.280]   And that happens millions of times a day
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.600]   throughout the country.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.160]   And a good portion of those probably happen
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.520]   here in California, because that's kind of the way
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.080]   the legal system is arranged.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.120]   So this is not somebody, you know,
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.760]   it could be somebody manipulating the law.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.220]   It could also be somebody who's being entirely honest
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.200]   about their experience of being injured
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.720]   by somebody else's dog.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.800]   So under those conditions, I mean,
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.420]   it sounds like the same set of rules apply.
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:23.220]   You want to know how serious they are.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:24.800]   Do they have a case, so to speak?
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.160]   That's the work of the lawyers.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.840]   But in assessing how serious somebody is,
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:33.240]   you said it's fair, you called it the F word, I like that.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.520]   I'll never forget that.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.880]   It just asks a fair question.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.700]   Like, how much money do you think you deserve?
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:43.420]   Or would that be a good example of a very direct question?
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.800]   Or is it how likely are you to walk away
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.080]   if we don't give you the money?
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.240]   Like, you know, is there, I mean,
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.700]   'cause I could imagine there's all sorts of reasons
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.360]   why people would be dishonest
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.000]   about answering those questions.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.360]   - Well, and then how much money you think you deserve
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.200]   is a really good question.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.520]   Not necessarily what the answer is, but how they answer it.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.160]   You're gonna get how quickly they fire back
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.520]   and whether or not they stop and think about it.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.680]   How and what questions typically
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.920]   are best to judge the other side's reaction
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.540]   and the answer is secondary.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.280]   'Cause the how or what question causes
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.040]   what we would refer to as deep thinking, slow thinking,
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.020]   Danny Kahneman, behavioral economics,
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.360]   thinking fast and slow, slow thinking is in-depth thinking.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.680]   You ask a how or what question
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.840]   to make the other side think first
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.760]   and judge their reaction to how they think about it.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.160]   And do they actually think about it?
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.640]   Or do they fire right back at you?
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.360]   It gives you a clearer picture of who you're dealing with,
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.280]   where the outcome is gonna go.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.400]   How much money do you think that you deserve
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.600]   if they immediate, you know, $10 million?
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.320]   All right, so this is,
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.480]   I got a shakedown artist on the other side.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.600]   Or they say, all right, if they stop and think about it
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.040]   and they give you a thoughtful answer,
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.200]   that's a completely different person on the other side.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.160]   You're asking a question to get a,
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.500]   to diagnose how they respond first, the answer is second.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.300]   And sometimes I, if it's a cutthroat on the other side,
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.720]   I'm gonna start pampering them with how and what questions
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.560]   just to wear 'em out.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.240]   That's passive aggression.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.840]   If I got a cutthroat aggressor on the other side,
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.920]   I'm gonna drop into passive aggressive behavior
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:40.680]   to slow 'em down and wear 'em out.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.480]   One of my hostage negotiation heroes,
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.520]   a guy named Johnny Pico was John Domenico Pico,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.720]   not Johnny, like Johnny Rockets, Italian Johnny,
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.340]   John Domenico, got all the Western hostages
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.940]   out of Beirut in the mid '80s.
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.040]   Wrote a book called "Man Without a Gun,"
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.200]   negotiated in person, face-to-face with Hezbollah.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.280]   The only guy that ever did that, got everybody out.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.320]   And in his book, he wrote one of the great secrets
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.180]   to negotiation is learning how to exhaust the other side.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.520]   And when you've got a really dangerous adversary
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.960]   on the other side of the table, you don't go nose to nose,
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.440]   you don't argue, you're not combative, you wear 'em out.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.040]   Exhaust 'em.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.080]   And if you got somebody really combative
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.640]   or cutthroat on the other side,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.600]   start pampering 'em with how and what questions
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.360]   'cause to even think about the answer, it tires 'em out.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.420]   And it's passive aggressive and it's deferential
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.660]   and it really works.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.040]   - So if the person on the opposite side
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.720]   of a high friction negotiation is aggressive,
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.800]   the goal is to slow things down, fatigue them,
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.820]   and get them to just either relent
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:03.240]   or to reveal something that's a loophole, right?
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.540]   - Yeah, if I have to make the deal,
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.860]   then I'm going to wear 'em out.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.960]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.640]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.020]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.500]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.260]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.600]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.800]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.400]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.420]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.320]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.440]   about hormones and so on,
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.460]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.760]   With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.520]   that makes it very easy to understand your data
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.440]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.600]   and behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.400]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.840]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.

[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.360]   I'm interested in drilling a little bit further
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.500]   into this process of wearing them down
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.580]   and the passive aggressive way
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:30.060]   of reducing the aggressor's stance.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.560]   And I want to highlight for people
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.420]   that what we're talking about here
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.320]   isn't manipulation to extract something.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.340]   We're actually talking about the reverse.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.600]   We're talking about a bad actor who's aggressive
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   and trying to defang that bad actor.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.400]   What does that process of wearing them down look like
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.240]   or sound like?
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.320]   Could you give us a couple of examples of,
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.920]   let's say I'm the bad actor.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.840]   We could play this game.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.240]   I won't be very good at this.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:02.320]   And I am saying, look, I want X number of dollars
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.480]   by this date or you're not going to get what you want.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.560]   They're going to die or disappear.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.800]   It's that simple.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.120]   And I'm a Stonewall kind of approach.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.280]   What is the approach that you take
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.520]   to wear that person down?
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.500]   - Well, they're going to be questions
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.760]   that are mostly how and what,
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.960]   and they're going to be legitimate questions,
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.160]   which is how do I know you're going to follow through?
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.080]   What does that look like?
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.180]   Like, if I do what you want,
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.040]   how do I know you're going to follow through?
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.600]   - So get them to talk about the alternative.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.200]   Okay, so if you were to, well, if you deliver by that date,
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.160]   I'm going to pass them to you without fail.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.080]   Like if they're just getting kind of brief answers
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.720]   where the person is just, again,
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.800]   this kind of like rigid Stonewall approach.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.560]   - Yeah, well, and so there's a phrase
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.380]   that we use all the time, vision drives decision.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.560]   So if you're really going to comply, if I give in,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.200]   and when I said, how do I know you're going to follow through
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.840]   I'm not talking about the threat.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.820]   I'm not trying to get you to clarify the threat.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.400]   I'm trying to get you to clarify
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.120]   what implementation looks like.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.080]   So I need to know, I'm based on your reaction to that.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:33.100]   If you plan on following through, if I comply,
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.580]   you will already have that in your head or be open to it.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.840]   Vision drives decision.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.600]   You've thought it through in advance.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.380]   What does letting the hostages go look like?
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:48.740]   If you have no intention of ever releasing the hostage,
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.820]   if I follow through, then you're not going to be able
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.940]   to answer the question and you're probably going to throw it
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.340]   back on me really quickly.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.660]   And so then now I know like, all right,
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.460]   so you got no plans on complying.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.560]   If I give in, you're not going to comply.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.700]   So I, but you still want the money.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:13.180]   Then I'm going to ask, well, how am I supposed to pay you
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.940]   if you don't have any plans for complying?
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:20.440]   And if you're willing to entertain a conversation
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.760]   about what compliance looks like.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.820]   There was a kidnapping that my unit worked
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.020]   just before I was in it in Venezuela,
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.220]   where they weren't entirely sure that the bad guys
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.940]   were going to, the FARC, I think, had the hostage.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:41.380]   They agreed on an exchange point to let the hostage go
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.740]   that was some distance from where they had a pretty good idea
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.520]   the hostage was being held.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.180]   So they figured they're not going to drag the hostage
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.580]   all the way to this river crossing
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.700]   if they're not going to let them go.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.500]   It's just too much effort.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.360]   And then it was one of the few times
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.580]   there was going to be a simultaneously,
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.300]   theoretically a simultaneous exchange,
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.500]   but they're going to have to send the money
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.780]   across the river before the hostage was let go.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.260]   So if we agree to this, all right,
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.140]   so they're not going to drag this guy
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.580]   all the way to this river crossing.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.980]   They don't plan on letting them go.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.820]   And if it's a long way to drag them
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.740]   and they got their money, do they want to drag them back?
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.860]   Like even if they're ambivalent, once they get there,
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.360]   if they've gone through all the effort
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.200]   to get to the meeting location and the hostage is there,
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.360]   we've now just increased the chances significantly,
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.740]   they're going to go ahead and comply
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.180]   'cause it's a pain in the neck to take them back.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.140]   This is all human nature stuff, human nature investment.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:39.380]   How do you get them to engage in actions and behaviors
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.740]   and then verbal commitments
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.420]   that actually mean something to them?
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.780]   When I was working kidnappings,
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.020]   the very last thing we'd always have the family
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.900]   get the bad guys to say at last, not first, but last,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:56.060]   was we'd actually get a verbal promise to let them go.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:00.260]   Again, at the end, because we've been talking to them
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.220]   long enough at this point in time,
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.960]   we got a pretty good idea of what they sound like
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.300]   when they're lying and what they sound like
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.560]   when they're telling the truth.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.860]   If somebody tells the truth,
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.320]   they pretty much tend to tell the truth
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.580]   the same way every time, if they tell the truth.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.880]   You talk to somebody long enough, you got a line on,
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.420]   do they ever tell the truth?
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.860]   And if they do, what does it sound like?
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.180]   People lie 20 ways.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.000]   They tell the truth one way.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.900]   So we've been coaching in negotiations
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.340]   with the kidnappers long enough
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.500]   that we know what they sound like when they tell the truth.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.780]   So when they ask at the very end,
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.920]   if we paid you, promise to let them go,
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.420]   it's not that they answered, but how they answered it.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.840]   And that'll be the last thing to seal the deal.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.340]   How do you continually stack the odds
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.440]   in your favor for implementation?
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.440]   - Do you have a bodily, like a somatic sensor for lying?
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.260]   The reason I ask is, years ago,
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.280]   I had the experience of knowing somebody,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.260]   and they turned out to be a generally good person,
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:05.260]   but I sensed early on that something was like off.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.520]   I couldn't relax around them.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.400]   I just couldn't relax around them.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.560]   And I could not tell you why, but it was as if my,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.560]   I couldn't even identify the neuroanatomy of it.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.280]   You know, I'd say it was the vagus nerve or something,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.320]   but I teach neuroanatomy,
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.780]   and I can't point to one pathway in the body.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.600]   There was something about my autonomic response
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.200]   that would just start cranking up when I was around them,
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.460]   like something is off, something is off, something goes.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:32.900]   And I kid you not, five years later, five years later,
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.900]   I discovered a series of lies that all ratcheted together
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.760]   that were actually pretty meaningless
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.280]   in the total context of things.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.220]   But I remember thinking at that moment, oh my goodness,
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:51.220]   like my system knew, like knew.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.040]   And you know, for all my knowledge of neuroscience,
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.240]   I can't tell you to this day,
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.640]   like what it was in my biology,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.680]   but it had something to do with my bodily response.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.060]   It wasn't just a thought, like that doesn't quite add up,
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.800]   or I feel like I'm getting the runaround,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.420]   or this, it was a physical sensation.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.140]   - Are you familiar with that experience?
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.440]   - Yeah, well, it's a little bit what you guys
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.800]   and your colleagues are still discovering,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.840]   the science behind the gut.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.120]   And what we are actually teaching, you know,
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.480]   my company now, we're teaching people,
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.440]   learn the difference between your gut and your amygdala,
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.120]   for lack of a better term, your fear centers,
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.480]   and know which one is which and listen to your gut.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.720]   Your gut is ridiculously accurate.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.800]   Now, where does that information come from?
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.320]   One of your podcasts recently, I was listening to,
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.880]   we were talking about olfactory cues, right, the smells.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.200]   Like I never thought of that, of course.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   You know, yeah, what was the term
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.480]   for the molecules that you're putting off
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.020]   that-- - Oh, pheromones.
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:55.860]   - Oh, pheromones.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.920]   What are the powerful molecules gonna get kicked out?
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.040]   Like, of course, and that's why
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.040]   some of the great investigators I knew would say,
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.360]   I can just smell it, I can smell it.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.960]   So what all is feeding your gut,
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.720]   and what are the senses that the science
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.720]   hasn't yet discovered?
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.120]   You know, you can't make me believe,
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.000]   I will never believe that the life force stops
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.880]   at the surface of our skin, that there's energy,
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.640]   and that we can pick up on the energy.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.120]   I mean, our gut is being fed by all these different inputs
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.980]   that we're aware of or that we have yet to be made aware of.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.980]   The tone of voice doesn't match their words, the head tilt.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.020]   You've got a supercomputer in your brain,
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.480]   your gut is incredible.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.220]   If you could listen to it instead of your fear centers,
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.660]   and as soon as you start listening to your gut,
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.920]   you can't explain it at the time,
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.840]   but you got a bad feeling in your gut.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.200]   And later on, then you saw it all came together,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.880]   where your brain was picking up these cues.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.240]   Your brain was probably when you were in their presence.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.040]   There's gotta be an odor somebody gives off
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.880]   when they're intentionally deceiving.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.560]   You didn't know that that was a smell,
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.960]   and maybe you couldn't have consciously smelled it,
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.020]   but you're still picking it up.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:13.940]   So long answer to, I'm a very big believer in the gut.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:18.100]   I think there's science that we know and yet to discover
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.540]   that tells us that the gut is just ridiculously accurate
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.000]   if we listen to it instead of our fear centers.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.840]   - I completely agree that there are energetic exchanges
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.500]   that neuroscience can't yet explain.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.940]   The field of neuroscience, that is,
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.600]   is starting to explore some of these things.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.720]   There's basically three apex journals,
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.180]   the most competitive journals to publish in,
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.740]   Science, Nature, and Cell.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.360]   And I only mention that because there was a series
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.740]   of articles written in Science Magazine
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.880]   about magnetoreception in humans.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.280]   The idea that humans can detect magnetic fields
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.860]   sounds like quackery, right?
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.360]   Turtles can detect magnetic fields.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.160]   They migrate by them, actually, long distances.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.320]   But the idea is that humans can't do that.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.840]   And yet there are some well-controlled studies
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.240]   where people have to guess about the orientation
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.680]   of a magnetic field and they do it better than chance.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.480]   Not everyone can do it, but some can do it better
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.720]   than chance in a way that cannot be predicted
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   by anything else except some inherent form
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.000]   of magnetoreception in their nervous system.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.400]   So there are capabilities of the nervous system
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.060]   that are starting to be revealed,
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.000]   which we don't have a lot of evidence,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.780]   but there's enough evidence to suggest
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.820]   that these things are really happening.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.540]   The other example, which you might find interesting,
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.280]   is a little less esoteric,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.860]   but there was a beautiful paper published
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.300]   in one of the Cell press journals a couple of years ago
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.820]   showing that when people listen to the same story,
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.780]   the distance between their heartbeats
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:49.340]   tends to be very similar.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.960]   Now, it doesn't mean that their exact heart rates
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.800]   are similar, but if you look at the distance
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.160]   between their heartbeats, they all entrain
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.960]   to the same rhythm, the same song.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.200]   And get this, they're in completely separate rooms.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.080]   The experiments are being done on completely separate days.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.800]   And yet if I were to line up just the distance
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.660]   between the heartbeats for you,
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.160]   they would line up like a set of columns
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.800]   for dozens of individuals listening to the same story.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.400]   So clearly there's a passage of energy
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.600]   from things we hear and things we see
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.840]   that goes into our nervous system
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.640]   at a level that's below our conscious detection.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.660]   Here's the last thing I'll say about this.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.460]   We have a series on mental health coming out,
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.000]   not mental illness, but mental health,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.480]   by I think to be among the very finest psychiatrists
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.400]   in the world, Dr. Paul Conte.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.640]   And he said, we all think that the forebrain
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.320]   is the supercomputer.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.080]   He said, no, the subconscious is the supercomputer.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.060]   That's where the real knowledge processing is happening.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.900]   That's the iceberg below the surface
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.680]   where all the real heavy lifting has taken place.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.520]   And that people who learn to tap into the subconscious
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.080]   can learn to use that information in very meaningful ways.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.880]   And I think that's what you're describing.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.240]   - He's been on with you before, right?
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.440]   - He has to talk about trauma in particular.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.680]   And he was on Lex Friedman's podcast as well.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.820]   The series that we're doing with him
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.080]   is not about trauma per se.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.120]   It's really about the subconscious and the self.
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.240]   I think you'll find this series really interesting.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.020]   And it has a number of very practical questions
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.440]   that one can ask themselves about their subconscious
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.520]   and kind of work the process of psychiatry.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.780]   We're excited to release that series,
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.980]   'cause I don't know of anything like it
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:27.720]   that's been put out there into the public,
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.720]   but I was so pleasantly surprised to hear him say,
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.200]   we all hear that the forebrain is the supercomputer.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.460]   It's what drove our evolution.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.560]   He's like, no, no, no, no, it's the subconscious.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.060]   That's where our real wisdom resides.
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:45.360]   And the forebrain is just the implementation device.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   So it's, you know.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.880]   - How we can convince ourselves that we're in charge, right?
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I can't think of a time
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.880]   that my gut told me A and it turned out to be B.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.180]   More often than not though,
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.160]   I've suppressed my response to the gut.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.800]   I override it thinking, I think I made the mistake
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.120]   that you guys train your negotiators to avoid,
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.560]   which is I thought, well, this is making me anxious
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.240]   and the anxiety must be like me,
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.320]   like this must be my fault
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.140]   or I'm not able to call myself in this situation,
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.360]   not sleeping well, et cetera.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.080]   And therefore like this must represent some deficiency
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:21.920]   on my part.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.700]   And then, and Lord knows, as your shirt points out,
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.580]   I'm a very flawed person.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.420]   I have many flaws.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.000]   I always say I have 3000 pet peeves
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.520]   and at least as many flaws to match those pet peeves.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.440]   I wonder one at least relationship.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.920]   But the point being that I think our bodies really do know.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.200]   They know.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.040]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.400]   - Yeah, yeah, I would agree.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.880]   - So when you're doing negotiations
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.600]   and you're hearing somebody's voice on the phone,
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.840]   there are a lot of cues.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.720]   When you're face-to-face, there are additional cues.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.760]   There's their face.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.900]   And then of course, if the negotiations are being done
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.480]   by text over a computer or a phone,
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.040]   it's a very diminished environment for information.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.660]   So maybe we could talk about each of those
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:05.260]   because we live in those landscapes.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.700]   If we're face-to-face and we're negotiating,
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:12.900]   you're listening, of course, to what I want,
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.380]   what I'm insisting on.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.960]   You're working that process from your side.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.860]   What are you paying attention to visually?
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:25.000]   - It's more are things in alignment.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.980]   There's layman's data.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.620]   You know, the words, the way it's said
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.820]   and look on people's face and how are they weighed
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.520]   and how they play out.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.860]   There's a ratio out there that very unscientific,
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:41.860]   738, 55, 7% words, 38%, delivery, 55% body language.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.180]   People want to argue about it all the time,
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.840]   whether or not that's accurate.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.700]   As a rule of thumb, we throw that out there,
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:51.140]   but I tell people the most important issue
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.460]   is do they line up?
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:56.500]   So I'm not going to look for like,
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.580]   when do you raise your eyebrow
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.420]   or when do you look up until the left?
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.180]   I'm really just going to try to get a gut feeling
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.740]   whether or not I think these things are lining up,
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:09.080]   whether they're in alignment or whether they're out of line.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.540]   And then I'm going to be real careful about
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.360]   what meaning I assign to that.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.760]   You know, affective cues,
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.720]   changes in your tone of voice,
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.120]   changes in your movement.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.180]   That's one of the reasons why we don't teach
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:27.020]   reading people's body language
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:31.580]   because it's completely contextual to you and the moment.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:37.360]   So if I convinced myself that a raise of the eyebrow
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.560]   means this, it's out of context.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.700]   I was in a negotiation once where I threw out
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.140]   a figure to somebody and I some kind of look off to the side
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.000]   and look back and accepted my offer.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.440]   And I made the mistake of not saying to them,
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.100]   the appropriate thing for me to say at the time
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.300]   would have been, seems like something just crossed your mind
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.460]   because the only completely true observation,
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.540]   if they look to the side and look back,
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:07.180]   something crossed their mind.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.820]   Now I read it at the moment of saying
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.220]   that they had more money.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:16.140]   And I found out after the fact that was wrong,
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:19.100]   they were stretched to the limit.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.380]   The look of hesitation didn't mean
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.900]   that they were holding stuff, they were holding stuff back,
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.580]   but I read it wrong and I didn't bother to check
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.280]   on the affective cue that I saw.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.920]   So what am I babbling about?
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.020]   What I'm babbling about is if we're in a negotiation
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.960]   and whether or not I'm listening to your tone of voice
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.240]   or watching your body language or your words,
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.100]   if I see you shift at all, I should pay attention
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.680]   that there was a shift in your affective behavior,
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.200]   but I need to find out what was behind it
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.520]   as opposed to making an assumption as to what it meant.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.980]   So yeah, I'm gonna watch and I'm gonna get my gut feeling
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:05.360]   and I'm gonna say, sounds like there's some hesitation
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.520]   or it looks like something just crossed your mind.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.060]   Or even if I can't attribute it to specific affective move,
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.160]   I might say, it feels like there's something in the way.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.940]   That's me listening to my gut.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.160]   I'll throw out an observation on whatever any of those
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.800]   might be just to go back over the ground a little bit
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.880]   and double check.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.840]   'Cause the other thing about negotiating in person
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.700]   is you're gonna give me more information physically
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.560]   than I can actually process.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.360]   And if you say something that's thought provoking,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.880]   I'll stop and think about it and while I'm stopping
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.160]   and thinking about what you just said,
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.640]   I'm missing all your cues.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.200]   So all the skills that we teach, the labels, the mirrors,
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.560]   the opening of questions, which seem like we're going back
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.520]   and plowing the ground again.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.560]   We are because I didn't pick up all the information
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.600]   the first time, there's just more there than I can get.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.480]   And so I need to go back over it a couple of times with you
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:15.660]   just so I get it right without making you feel interrogated.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.120]   You actually feel heard and you actually get to go back
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.760]   over it again, so it becomes what seems to be
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.800]   an inefficient process, but it's actually me
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.560]   just double checking my information.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:31.700]   So if we're face to face, I'm gonna ask you to repeat,
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.120]   but I'm not gonna say, would you please repeat that?
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.740]   I'm gonna get you to repeat without asking you to repeat.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.640]   - Is the same true in online or text communications?
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.360]   - The same thing is true, the problem with online and text
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:47.960]   is people try to bundle everything into one communication.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.480]   The best analogy I can think of is if you were playing chess
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.000]   by text, would you put seven moves in your text?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.180]   No, you'd only put one move in.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.760]   So only try to get one point across in a text,
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.180]   don't explain, don't throw a whole bunch of stuff in,
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:08.760]   text or emails, they're all almost always too long.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.480]   And it's going to come off as cold,
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.100]   so do what you can to soften, soften it.
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:20.060]   There's a documentary film that's been done on my company
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:25.060]   called Tactical Empathy, Nick Nanton won 22, 23 Emmys,
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:30.180]   the filmmaker DNF, DNA Films, it was finished last year,
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.900]   it's not out yet, for a variety of reasons
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.000]   we haven't put it out.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.720]   So we screened the thing in Vegas last year,
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.760]   I see it, I love it.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.440]   I'm not a good judge of a film about me,
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.340]   I'm gonna love it no matter what, it's about me.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.320]   But I tell Nick that night, oh man, I love it,
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.700]   this is great.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.320]   Two days later, I find out,
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.500]   I realize there's a huge problem.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.480]   I've already told him it's okay.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.540]   So I gotta get him, I'm gonna text him,
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.620]   and then I'm gonna call him, and we gotta fix it now,
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.300]   it's a Sunday.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.800]   Text message, I sent him a two line text.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.020]   It's now a bad time to talk.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.980]   I got something you don't wanna hear.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.340]   Two lines.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.840]   Now, what were my other options?
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.280]   I coulda called him, Nick and I got a great relationship.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.460]   I call him, if he's in a position to pick up the phone,
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.880]   doesn't matter what he's doing,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.280]   he's gonna answer the phone.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.100]   He was in the middle of a Zoom call.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.480]   If I'da called, he'da picked up during the Zoom call,
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.120]   and both conversations woulda been bad.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.400]   He immediately fires back to me,
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.340]   I'm in the middle of a Zoom call,
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.480]   I'll call you in a half an hour.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.440]   He already knows he ain't gonna like what he's gonna hear.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.780]   I'm prepping him for bad news.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:54.900]   Get him on the phone, like look, I know what I said,
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:57.400]   we got a problem, we gotta get Derek on camera.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.600]   Derek is a guy in my team, and I'm shocked
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.260]   that I haven't made him part of the documentary.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.960]   This is gonna be incomplete without Derek.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.100]   We gotta get Derek on film, we can't show this
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.880]   to anybody else 'til we get him on film
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.400]   and make him part of it.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.240]   Immediately, he's in problem solving mode.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.800]   He goes, okay, I gotta get a crew to Derek
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.240]   or get Derek to a crew, I need to know when we can do that,
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.840]   I need to, we got another showing of the film scheduled
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.320]   in LA less than a month away.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.640]   He says, I gotta get Derek on camera, and we gotta edit it.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.760]   It's gonna take three weeks of editing.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.560]   I said, I'll get you access to Derek's camera.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.840]   He goes, done, or Derek's calendar.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.880]   He says, done, it's done.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.720]   We go through this whole conversation
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.440]   in less than 10 minutes.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.000]   Now think of the normal negotiation.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.840]   Hey, Nick, how are you, what's going on today?
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:48.960]   Are you in a good mood?
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.760]   Hey, hey, hey, how the kid's doing?
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.860]   All this time-wasting conversation.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.360]   If I'd have set him up with that normal,
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.400]   he would also, he could have legitimately said,
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.680]   are you out of your mind?
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.980]   We've been working on this for a year.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.360]   You didn't bring this up in a year.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.640]   Not only that, you already told me two days ago
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:10.560]   at the showing in Vegas that you loved it.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.840]   And now, a year, year and a half into this project,
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.000]   you're bringing up all these new problems.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.780]   That would have been the normal negotiation.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:21.920]   But since we got a highly collaborative relationship,
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.080]   I two-line text, we're done in 10 minutes.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.760]   Now, since Nick's a very generous guy,
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.160]   when he gets done, and he says, by the way,
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.760]   you understand how much this is gonna cost me.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.920]   It's just three weeks of editing.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.040]   This is three hours of shooting and three weeks of editing.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:37.880]   I go, yeah.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.200]   He goes, but I'm happy to do it.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.440]   Calls me back the next day.
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.960]   He's got a favor to ask of me.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.280]   You got it.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.500]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.960]   Because we'd gone through what would have been
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.660]   a very complicated negotiation that started on text.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:59.280]   And I sent him a two-line text on a Sunday.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.780]   And we got to solve that fast.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.400]   - So if I understand correctly,
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.040]   by setting the context in a very direct and succinct way.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.040]   - Right.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.520]   - He goes into it in a problem-solving mode with you.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.120]   Whereas if you do the tour of all the things
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.480]   that are going well in life.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.460]   - Yeah, hey, how are you?
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:21.280]   - Yeah, the sort of the, we'll keep this PG.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.620]   You know, the mud sandwich approach, you know?
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.880]   You know how they teach you that?
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.900]   When you get a laboratory, you know,
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.120]   most scientists have no skill running a business, right?
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.020]   You get a laboratory, all you've done is experiments.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.360]   And then suddenly you're in charge of people
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.880]   managing budgets and all this stuff.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.760]   I mean, most scientists, 99% of scientists
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.440]   are completely unqualified to do the job
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.880]   they do at the level of running a laboratory.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.320]   When they start, you learn it on the job.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.180]   And eventually you end up having to let somebody go.
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.560]   And so the typical thing they teach you
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.800]   in these online training things is,
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.480]   you tell somebody something nice,
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.840]   then you give them the bad news.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.560]   And then you tell them something nice on exit, right?
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:59.080]   That's kind of the mud, so to speak, sandwich.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:25:59.920]   - Right.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.740]   - All right.
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.920]   This is not that.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.400]   What you're talking about is saying,
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.040]   hey, this is the problem.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.000]   You're not gonna like the problem.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.940]   Or there is a problem, you're not gonna like it.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.880]   So that they show up with the context of solving a problem.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.160]   As opposed to giving them the tour
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.200]   of all the things that are going well.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.480]   And then the problem is really in contrast to that.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.520]   And then it's like, ugh.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.600]   You know, so what I love about what you're describing is,
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.840]   it's just, it's direct, it's honest.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.560]   You're not doing the tour of the garden
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.120]   before you take them down to the septic tank.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.800]   - It's what I would call the difference
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.360]   between being blunt and being a straight shooter.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.880]   A straight shooter tells you the truth.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.480]   They just tell it in a way that lands softly.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.880]   - Let's talk about breakups.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.640]   Business breakups, romantic breakups.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.780]   - Right.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.240]   You breaking up with me?
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.080]   - No.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:56.920]   [laughing]
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.160]   No.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.640]   But thanks for the hypothesis test.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.120]   - No, in fact, I'm enjoying this conversation so much.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.760]   As I always do, I'm learning a ton from you.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.960]   That if anything, I'd like to expand
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.520]   and deepen our relationship, Chris.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.820]   [laughing]
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.960]   There, you got a lot of knowledge out of me.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.140]   Platonic and professional, but expansive.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:27.440]   What is the process of ending a relationship?
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.020]   And again, this could be a romantic relationship,
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:30.640]   could be business relationship,
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.720]   could be employer, employee,
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:38.720]   could be individuals, could be telling a whole group
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.280]   or an entire group telling an individual.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.440]   The reason I raised this as a particular example
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.220]   is that I'm assuming that both sides
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.700]   don't want the same thing.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:56.180]   One side wants to continue, the other side wants to end.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:01.000]   I'll avoid the use of the word win-win
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.200]   or the words win-win, excuse me.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.520]   And just ask, is there a way to have that conversation
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.420]   in any of the contexts I just mentioned
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:14.240]   in a, as you so beautifully described it,
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.260]   a straight shooter manner where it's direct,
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:18.160]   it's honest, but it lands soft.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.440]   Because what we're talking about here
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.480]   is feelings of rejection.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.620]   And nobody likes feeling rejected.
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.800]   I don't know anybody that likes being fired.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.640]   Even from jobs they don't like,
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.680]   people's egos suffer.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.520]   - Right.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.380]   - So is there maybe a more specific way
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.440]   of asking the question is,
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:41.100]   is there a way to encourage the person getting the bad news
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.020]   to get their ego out of the way
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.600]   and see that if both parties don't want it,
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.080]   it's best for everybody involved?
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.940]   - I almost want to say no.
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.040]   But first, what are the caveats?
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.960]   Most of the time when people are struggling with this,
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.200]   they're not trying to save the other side,
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.440]   they're trying to save themselves.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.080]   So who are you really trying to save?
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.280]   By postponing it, softening it,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.280]   trying to act like it's something that it's not.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:13.080]   I don't know that anybody has ever been fired
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.320]   that didn't have a sense that it was coming.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.080]   The person that was getting ready to fire them
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.760]   opens up by saying, "How are you?"
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:24.640]   They know how the other person is.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.440]   And the person getting ready to get fired
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.840]   has got some gut instinct that things are going wrong.
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.760]   Like you said, the gut's very powerful.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.120]   So you gotta lower the boom as quickly as you can,
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.820]   but also as gently as you can.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:43.760]   I was involved in a nonprofit a number of years ago
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.160]   affiliated with a church,
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.360]   and we're struggling with whether or not
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.760]   to let the executive director go.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.440]   I go to the minister of the church,
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.320]   Norman Vincent Peale's protege,
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.680]   a guy named Arthur Caliandro,
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.360]   one of the best human beings I've ever met in my life.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.280]   Phenomenal guy.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.840]   And I'm struggling with,
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.560]   I thought firing, letting this woman go was gonna be bad,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.420]   and I thought Arthur was gonna counsel me a way out.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.580]   And he looked at me and he said,
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.360]   "You know, there's no gentle way
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.920]   "to cut somebody's head off."
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.560]   And I thought, yeah, the humane thing here is
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.880]   how do you, to bring it to conclusion
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.080]   as quickly as possible,
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.600]   'cause there's no humane way to cut somebody's head off.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:28.480]   There's no humane way to terminate the relationship.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.860]   Now, what are the caveats?
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.000]   Maybe there are.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.640]   First caveat, if you're gonna fire somebody,
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.000]   never fire somebody on a Friday.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.940]   Fire 'em on a Monday.
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.160]   Fire 'em on a Monday,
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.160]   they got a work week to work their way out of it.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.640]   You fire 'em on a Friday,
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.280]   they got a weekend to be miserable and to feel horrible,
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.420]   and they can't do anything about it.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.040]   Caught off guard or not on a Monday,
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.240]   they can pick themselves up,
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.800]   they can start looking for a new job,
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.520]   no matter who you are.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.000]   Fire 'em on a Friday, they can't start looking
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.240]   for a new job on a Saturday.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.400]   It's two days of misery.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.000]   So yeah, if you're gonna fire somebody,
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.640]   fire 'em on a Monday, not on a Friday.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.980]   If you got bad news to give somebody,
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.920]   warn 'em it's coming.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:09.920]   The people are ridiculously resilient to pain if warned,
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.640]   and then that you lower the boom.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.000]   You're not gonna like what I have to say.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.580]   It's gonna be heartbreaking.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.360]   You're gonna hate me.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:23.760]   Hesitate no more than three seconds.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:27.440]   They got their guard up, let 'em have the bad news.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.860]   That's the humane way to cut somebody's head off.
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:35.440]   Don't linger, don't make 'em think that,
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:38.080]   how are the kids, how are ya, I care about you,
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.860]   you're a great human being.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.960]   None of this stuff at the beginning.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.580]   Warn 'em bad news is coming and hit 'em with the bad news.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.420]   Rip the Band-Aid off.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:51.240]   The pain is not if you try to rip the Band-Aid off slowly.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.160]   That's excruciating, you're trying to save yourself.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.100]   So if you gotta terminate a relationship
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:00.900]   regardless of what it is, the quicker you do it,
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:04.800]   the less painless it is, the sooner people can move on.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.900]   Stop trying to save yourself.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.120]   Realize how human beings handle pain.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.300]   If anything, human beings are incredibly resilient
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.860]   if given the opportunity to brace themselves first.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.060]   - I agree.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.000]   Thank you for that.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.620]   There's a concept that a lot of people haven't heard of,
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.060]   and I'm confident in saying that
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.980]   because I hadn't heard of it until recently,
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.980]   despite spending a lot of time in the literature
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.300]   around dopamine and motivation.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.520]   And it's a term from psychology
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.320]   that is being used a little bit more now,
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.720]   and it's ego depletion.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.160]   Yeah, it's an interesting concept,
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.020]   and I've been wanting to run this by you for a while,
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.940]   but I saved it for our discussion today.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:46.900]   It turns out ego depletion is a lot like decision fatigue.
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.900]   We all heard the Steve Jobs thing.
[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:52.440]   He wore a black turtleneck every day
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.940]   because he didn't have to make that decision,
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.100]   so he had more energy to make other decisions.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.260]   I've been accused of doing the same
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:59.660]   because of my black long sleeve shirts,
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.700]   but there's a whole other reason for that
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.000]   that some people might know.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.420]   But anyway, it's unimportant in the moment.
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:08.640]   But ego depletion is a little bit different
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.340]   than decision fatigue or decision budget.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.460]   The idea with ego depletion is pretty simple.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.580]   It's that the molecule dopamine
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.180]   does many things in the brain,
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.020]   but one of the things that it absolutely does
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:25.440]   is it holds us to goal-directed behavior
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.540]   that's associated with our sense of self,
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.700]   like I want to accomplish this.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.860]   I want to get to that.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:35.260]   And the whole notion of ego depletion involves the idea,
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.820]   and this has been a data-substantiated observation,
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:41.220]   that when people have to fight to be right
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.500]   or to defend their position for a period of time,
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.180]   eventually that depletes.
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:51.140]   And it seems to be, at least in part, dopamine-mediated
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:55.240]   because defending one's position takes work.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.540]   Earlier, you talked about running somebody down,
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:00.380]   wearing them out.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:04.620]   And I wonder, as I just throw this concept out to you,
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:07.700]   cold here, whether or not that calls to mind
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.320]   any examples from your work
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.300]   where you felt like, okay, this person could really hold,
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:18.000]   but if I just kept pressing, eventually they'd tilt.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.200]   And it's different than the kind of fatigue
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.620]   that comes from a conversation
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.860]   that starts at three in the afternoon
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.060]   and ends at 2.30 in the morning.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.220]   We've all been there.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:27.340]   I've been in those conversations.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.580]   Usually, they're not very pleasant.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.560]   And at three in the morning, everyone's peeling apart.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.000]   I've learned over the years,
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000]   you clip it at 9.30 and you try and shift, right?
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.740]   One of the worst pieces of advice I've ever heard
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.440]   is you'd never go to sleep angry.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.300]   It's like, no, actually get sleep, wake up,
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.820]   and then revisit the problem if the situation allows.
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:52.060]   That's my belief anyway. - I would agree, yeah.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.840]   - Trying to stay up all night, trying to work something out.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.660]   It's just counterbiology.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.120]   So ego depletion.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.740]   I have a feeling a lot of what you did in your profession
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.560]   was running down their dopamine
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.260]   to the point where then they are operating
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:08.260]   from a different place,
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.360]   where they're not defending the ego.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.700]   They're actually thinking more practically
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.060]   about the whole situation.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.800]   Does this have any kind of texture or meaning to you?
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.240]   - Yeah, no, I would agree.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.240]   And I would draw the distinction.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.300]   First of all, in hostage negotiation,
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:27.580]   there's two kinds of hostage takings if there's a demand.
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:31.440]   And there's gonna be contained and uncontained,
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.340]   which is just literal definition.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.100]   Contained is bad guys in a bank,
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:38.420]   like at the Chase Bank in Brooklyn way back when.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.620]   You got 'em surrounded, they can't get away.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:43.020]   And uncontained is a kidnapping.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.420]   You don't know where they are.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.040]   Uncontained, unknown location.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.360]   We're gonna try to get our way in a contained situation,
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.380]   probably by ego depletion, wearing 'em out,
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:58.300]   getting to the point where they're just gonna get in
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.680]   'cause they're tired.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.060]   'Cause they're gonna come out
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.700]   and we're gonna put handcuffs on 'em.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.700]   Which means that if the ego gets recharged,
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:13.260]   they're gonna go back and they're gonna think back
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.120]   over the deal.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.480]   So wearing somebody out in a business negotiation,
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.820]   it's basically uncontained
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.460]   because even if you come to an agreement,
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.860]   there's a whole implementation phase.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:26.740]   Did you get the agreement 'cause you warm up?
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.460]   'Cause they get tired.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.760]   'Cause they just gave in.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.020]   At some point in time, they're gonna get recharged
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.540]   and they're gonna get recharged
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.700]   while you're in implementation.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:38.780]   So they're either not gonna follow the terms of the deal
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.360]   or at the slightest opportunity, they're gonna deviate.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:48.440]   And so yeah, I think ego depletion is a real thing
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.820]   and it's a bad way to get a business deal
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.240]   that's gonna stick.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:57.100]   - 'Cause they rest and then they come back
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:57.980]   a different person.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.860]   - Yeah, they're gonna be recharged.
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:03.140]   Their ego's gonna be recharged.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:05.140]   And if you got the agreement
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:06.860]   based on a depletion of their ego,
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:09.720]   that battery's gonna get charged back up again,
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.700]   whether it's a business deal,
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.300]   whether it's a personal negotiation.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:15.700]   You have a disagreement with your significant other
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:19.280]   and you follow that bad advice, don't go to bed angry.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.900]   And so you stay up till three in the morning
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.500]   and you think you come to a resolution.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.580]   Everybody gets a good night's sleep
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.300]   and the next day they feel completely differently
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.180]   about what they said the night before.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:31.260]   - Yeah, I might've heard of that happening once or twice.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:32.100]   - Saw it in a movie, right?
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.300]   - Yeah, saw it in a movie.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:35.300]   A friend explained that situation to me.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:39.780]   Earlier you mentioned approaching a conversation
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:40.900]   in a playful way.
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:41.740]   - Right.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.980]   - Like, all right, this might even be life or death,
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:45.720]   but let's play this like a game
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.080]   because you can see more opportunities.
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.160]   Now we know that when we are relaxed,
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.220]   we see the big picture.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:53.700]   When we're tense, everything narrows.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:54.540]   - Tunnel vision.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.880]   - Tunnel vision, tunnel thinking, tunnel everything.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.060]   We lose access to the full toolkit.
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:04.460]   So you obviously take really good care of yourself.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.940]   You're fit, you're in shape.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.020]   You always seem calm.
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:08.980]   I'm sure you have your moments like anybody else,
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:13.260]   but what are some of the things
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.420]   that good negotiators do all the time
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:20.860]   so that when the bell goes off and they have to respond,
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.940]   they are ready?
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.540]   And the reason I ask this is because, you know,
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:29.220]   we've been talking about negotiations in kind of a vacuum,
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.820]   like it's happening and then how does one handle it?
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:34.500]   But like any athlete, like any teacher,
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.340]   like any parent, like any kid,
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:41.040]   everybody has to be ready for real life circumstances
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.300]   and we don't always get the warning.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:46.220]   We don't get the memo that it's happening in two weeks.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:50.020]   And sometimes the conversations around courtroom drama
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:53.420]   or the big day, you know, it implies that we get the warning
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:55.740]   but more often than not, it's a phone call or a text
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:58.000]   and it comes in and boom, it just hits us.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.680]   And suddenly we are in negotiations
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.580]   and we didn't get time to prepare.
[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:05.240]   So maybe we could talk about readiness
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.120]   and then we could talk about, again,
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.480]   like maybe this sounds trivial to you,
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.920]   but for me, I'd be very curious to know whether or not
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.640]   you have any practices of stilling yourself,
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.680]   what those look like, what you've seen other people use
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.340]   to be able to get themselves into the moment
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.900]   of being able to show up their best self.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.140]   - Yeah, well, readiness.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.620]   Small stakes practice for high stakes results.
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.140]   Like I will occasionally find myself
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.200]   in the middle of a negotiation that I didn't expect.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.080]   Like if I've been throwing out stuff on a regular basis
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.080]   on my way during the day, verbal observations,
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.580]   what we refer to as labels, 'cause the label seems like
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.060]   something just crossed your mind.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.840]   Is a label in the middle of a negotiation
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.380]   when I see you hesitate or look to the side?
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:54.380]   How do I get ready for that?
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:57.800]   - You know, I'm on my way over here to this interview.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.540]   I'm both talking to my Lyft driver the whole way,
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.040]   getting them to talk.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.780]   Also being careful about not tapping the gas tank out
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.180]   completely so that I'm fatigued when I get here.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.140]   Like I talk up to Lyft drivers on a regular basis.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:18.820]   The interactions, TSA guys in the airport,
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.360]   I'll throw a label at them.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]   Seems like a tough day.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.800]   Tough day?
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.500]   Seems like you're in a good mood.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.660]   And whether right or wrong, I'm getting in,
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.000]   I'm trying to stay loose.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.560]   I'm trying to keep the mental muscles limber.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:37.760]   And it just becomes a bit of a habit on a regular basis.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.860]   Occasionally, I'll throw something out.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.600]   Now I'm talking about Lyft drivers.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.680]   Like if I'm in a bad mood, I get into a Lyft
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.380]   a couple of weeks ago on my way home.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.720]   Lyft driver is not helpful.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.040]   I mean, I'm coming out of the airport,
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.180]   I'm struggling with my bags, not lifting a finger.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.880]   It doesn't open up the rear.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.680]   I gotta open up the rear of the vehicle myself.
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:58.920]   I gotta load the bags, everything.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:03.140]   I get in and he's just seething unhappiness.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.600]   Now I know that if I say,
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.260]   what do you love about what you do for a living?
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.600]   I immediately trigger what Tony Robbins
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.680]   would call a state change.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.960]   And I'm annoyed at this guy.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.960]   And our pheromones are combative.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:23.600]   But I'm thinking like, I just don't need this.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.220]   And so I go, what do you love about driving for Lyft?
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:29.000]   This guy proceeds to unload on me
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.560]   on all his personal struggles
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.920]   that I feel like a complete jerk for being angry with him
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.760]   at everything that he's going through.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.380]   And I'm just trying to get myself out of a bad mood
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.640]   and to keep from sending him a really negative vibe
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.000]   the whole way so that he doesn't drive 45 miles an hour
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.600]   in a 65 mile an hour lane and make it,
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.980]   you know, inflict me with a longer and more expensive ride
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.900]   because I'm so annoying as a customer.
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:57.820]   But I've got a habit of small stakes practice
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:58.920]   for high stakes results.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.200]   And who do I get a practice on?
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.840]   The Lyft drivers on a regular basis.
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:06.240]   The guy behind the counter at the hotel, the TSA guy.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.560]   I'm going through TSA, the grocery store clerk,
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.380]   the Starbucks person.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.780]   The only way I'm at my best in my negotiations
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:16.520]   is just trying to keep my negotiation muscles limber
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.520]   by interacting with people throughout the course of my day.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.120]   And then ideally, you know,
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.860]   leaving them better than I found them.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:27.920]   You know, trying not to leave negative karma in my wake,
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.460]   trying to leave as much positive karma
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.680]   in my wake as possible.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.860]   - I love that.
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.920]   And I'm very familiar with the feeling of needing
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.840]   to conserve my voice for podcasting or energy for things.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.660]   And yet I'm somebody who's I think genuinely curious
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.620]   about what people's experiences are.
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:48.380]   So I like the question, you know, how's your day going?
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:50.220]   It's pretty open-ended.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.900]   It's I suppose, if somebody was really upset,
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.640]   that would be perhaps the worst question
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.020]   I could possibly ask from what you just described, but.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.560]   - Well, I'll put a fine point on it too,
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.840]   because like I've manipulated them with,
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:03.940]   what do you love about?
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:09.940]   Because there's, you watch them change in the moment
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.140]   to immediately to shift into this concept of love,
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.980]   which is more than like,
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.780]   what do you like about driving for Lyft?
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:18.220]   What do you love about driving for Lyft?
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:22.580]   I can trigger a state change in you instantaneously,
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.660]   no matter what kind of mood you're in.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:26.300]   'Cause this guy was in a very bad mood.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:29.060]   Plus additionally, the download from that
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:31.260]   typically is so quick.
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:32.820]   I'm going to get a real clear picture
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:35.540]   on who you are really, really fast.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.260]   I'm talking to a CEO of a company a couple of months ago.
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.220]   They're, you know, for lack of a better term,
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.520]   they're delivering clean water to the world.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.360]   And I'm like, that's a cool mission.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:47.900]   Like I dig this.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.860]   As an entrepreneur,
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:53.040]   an entrepreneur wanting to make a dent in the universe,
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:53.980]   I dig that.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.580]   Like I'm trying to make a difference in the world.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:57.760]   So I say to him,
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.460]   what do you love about what you do for a living?
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.780]   He immediately fires back at me.
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.260]   I love leading teams.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.540]   I love leading teams.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.060]   And I love giving shareholders
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.780]   a great return on their investment.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.820]   It's really important for me
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.860]   to give shareholders a great return.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:13.740]   And then, yeah, you know, we deliver water.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.420]   And then he said a fourth thing.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.180]   And I thought, this guy could be doing toilet paper.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:22.160]   He doesn't care about the mission of the company at all.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.140]   He's a great CEO,
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:27.840]   probably because you want a CEO to lead teams.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.700]   You want a CEO to deliver, a corporate CEO,
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:33.860]   to deliver a return on investment for shareholders.
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:38.420]   But that's why he's a great corporate CEO
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:40.980]   and not a great entrepreneurial CEO.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.140]   So by him giving me that download real quick,
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.100]   that was blatantly honest.
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:47.860]   Like, do I think this is a great guy?
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:51.100]   Do our core values line up?
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:53.780]   My mission is more important to me than his mission is,
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.160]   or his mission is making money.
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.740]   Now I like making money, but it's not number one.
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:01.260]   It's a strong number two.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:05.960]   But that question, instead of how are you today,
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.180]   to what do you love about,
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:11.360]   you immediately put them in a better place.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.260]   Plus you get some ridiculously candid answers
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.160]   that tells you who they are real fast.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:21.020]   - What is the best way to approach our response
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:23.960]   to somebody who's asking to be heard?
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:27.240]   Perhaps they've got complaints.
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.080]   Maybe about us, maybe about somebody else.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.420]   You know, people who are venting.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:32.260]   - Right.
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:36.580]   - People seem to vary on the propensity to vent spectrum.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:39.200]   Some people are just, you know, they vent all the time.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.460]   This happened, that happened,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.540]   and you know, and they want to complain.
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:45.280]   You know, the way it's sometimes described
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:47.700]   is they love to take other people's inventories.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:50.000]   They love to take inventories of everybody else's mistakes.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.500]   They did this, they did that.
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:52.740]   - Right.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.320]   - You know, it's a lot easier often
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.200]   than taking our own inventories
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.580]   of what we could be focused on and do better.
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:01.460]   That's a universal truth in my mind.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:04.680]   But you know, people approach other people that they trust
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.460]   and they want to vent.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:11.680]   Presumably to get over whatever it is that is bothering them,
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.720]   but all too often it seems to just amplify
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.120]   the feelings of frustration.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.340]   What do you do when somebody you care about
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:23.300]   and that cares about you comes to you to vent?
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:26.580]   Is it just you let them vent?
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.740]   Or do you try and let them negotiate with themselves
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.060]   a little bit in a way that could help them more
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.400]   than if you were to just let them vent?
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:38.860]   - I'm really leery of letting people vent
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:43.380]   because a lot of times it seems to be a spiral
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:45.020]   that just spirals out of control.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:49.140]   So why is somebody venting?
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:49.980]   They don't feel hurt.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.180]   They feel ignored.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.020]   They feel like they've been wasting their time talking.
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.780]   They're frustrated.
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.740]   That's the feedback.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.900]   I'm gonna give you feedback on what I'm guessing
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:01.020]   is causing you to vent.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.780]   And just an observation.
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:05.460]   It sounds like this is driving you crazy
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:07.340]   'cause nobody listens to you.
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:08.600]   Sounds like you've been struggling with this
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.340]   for a long time.
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:12.640]   Sounds like this is very frustrating for you.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.180]   What's the emotion?
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.080]   The particular negative emotion.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.500]   Frustration is about somebody being denied a goal
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:21.340]   in the future.
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:24.660]   Anger is about somebody's upset about something happening
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:26.220]   in the past.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:29.460]   The type of negative emotion begins to focus you in on
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:32.500]   where they, is it forward thinking
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:33.980]   or is it backward thinking?
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:38.860]   And frustration and anger can be two very different versions
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:40.320]   of the same negative emotion,
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.340]   but they're focused on different points in time.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.340]   So I'm gonna try to intuitively,
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:48.260]   if I don't know from what you've told me,
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:50.920]   I'm gonna start taking educated guesses
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:54.780]   on making an observation on what it is that's driving you.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:59.000]   If you need to vent, you've been talking
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.700]   and people have been ignoring you.
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:03.100]   Or you've been taking actions
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:04.900]   and people have been ignoring you.
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.780]   You need to vent because your communication
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.620]   or your actions have been ignored.
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:10.900]   There are some clues here and the sooner that I get
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.940]   at the heart of what's bothering you,
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.900]   the sooner you're gonna be able to let it off.
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:18.900]   So I'm gonna encourage letting the steam off
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:23.360]   without trying to correct you, without giving you advice,
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.860]   without frustrating you by not listening to you,
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:29.900]   by trying to recognize verbally
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:31.220]   what some of the motivators are,
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:34.180]   which will deactivate the anger much more quickly.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:37.180]   It's a whole basis for a crisis hotline to begin with.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.940]   People are venting.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:41.060]   And so how do you most effectively vent to somebody
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:44.080]   so that instead of going on a rant for an hour,
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.800]   and the rant introduced toxins into their system
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.220]   where they're poisoning themselves,
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:53.020]   I think negative emotions put toxins in our system.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:56.480]   How do I deactivate that as quickly
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.180]   so that you're not hurting yourself as much?
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.480]   And you feel heard, you feel relieved, you feel listened to.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:05.620]   And if it involves me, if it's a close friend
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.060]   who's venting to you,
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:10.220]   you're involved in a situation to some degree.
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:11.540]   And I might even say,
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:14.040]   "Boy, it feels like you're probably frustrated
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.220]   'cause I haven't listened to you up to now."
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.300]   And I'm gonna start taking some emotionally educated guesses
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.820]   on what I think is driving you.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.020]   And I'm gonna put it in the form of a label,
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.540]   which is just an observation,
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:28.180]   seems like, sounds like, looks like.
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:30.940]   Then if I get it wrong and you go, "Well, that's not it
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.460]   at all," I can say, "Well, that's just the way it seems.
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:37.100]   It just seems that way."
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.800]   It puts you in a position to just let somebody know
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.780]   you see them and you're doing your best to understand.
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.740]   I'm not a fan of venting.
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:50.740]   If I go on a rant personally, I always feel worse.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.100]   So I wanna deactivate that negativity
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.780]   so I can get my feedback under me emotionally.
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:02.080]   - Very useful knowledge you just shared with us.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.980]   Do you meditate?
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:07.760]   - Tiny little bits.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.260]   I mean, I'm trying to make my day more effective.
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:12.020]   I have a gratitude exercise
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:16.640]   that I do almost every morning.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.820]   Other ways to make myself effective.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:25.180]   Actually, I'm looking at the non-sleep deep rest practice
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:29.220]   or the, because I like to make use of my time.
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:34.500]   I'm spiritual, so I'm talking to the Almighty
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:35.340]   on a regular basis.
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.060]   - You pray. - I do, yeah.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.600]   - The morning and night, when you need to, both.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.440]   - Yeah, both.
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.060]   I mean, I think whether or not you believe in one God
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.940]   or the universe or whatever it is,
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:50.460]   I think spirituality is an important component of health.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:53.060]   Whatever your spirituality is and you should recognize it
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:56.900]   and you should, you'll be better off
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.100]   if you engage in some sort of a spiritual practice.
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:03.180]   Doesn't have to be any of the three major religions,
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:05.260]   but spirituality is a component of who we are.
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.420]   So yeah, I practice it on a regular basis.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:11.740]   - So sense of higher power or to better define higher power,
[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:13.460]   it could be, as you said,
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:14.780]   aligned with conventional religion
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:16.700]   or just aligned with the idea
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.700]   that there are things outside of us
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:20.620]   that are important to pay attention to
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:25.620]   that we can all do better by being in recognition of
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.020]   or service to or both.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:28.860]   Something like that?
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:29.920]   - Yeah, pretty much like that.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:34.660]   And then leaving it as open and as possible
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:37.900]   'cause I think there's a spiritual nature to us, period.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.820]   - I agree.
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:43.000]   What about your physical training?
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.180]   I must say, you're in excellent shape.
[01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:49.200]   I imagine that went along with the FBI thing.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:51.020]   I mean, I saw "Silence of the Lambs" at the beginning.
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:53.980]   She's running around with other agents, yeah.
[01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:57.520]   Shooting targets and running and lifting
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.240]   and doing their sit-ups in there.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:01.300]   That was a, I think it was a 1980s film.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.620]   So it was a little bit dated now.
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:04.940]   Probably now they're doing other stuff as well,
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:08.400]   but nothing works like the basics.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:13.140]   So was the FBI the first time you got serious about fitness
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.980]   or prior to that, were you an athlete and into fitness
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.440]   and what are you doing nowadays
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.940]   to maintain your frankly impressive shape?
[01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:23.540]   - Well, thank you for the compliments.
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:29.260]   Sports, athletics, fitness was always a part of my life.
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:32.300]   I was into sports, but not particularly good at them.
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:34.860]   Football, basketball.
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:38.660]   I'm a last century guy.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:43.660]   So long before the conditioning has evolved as it is now
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:46.140]   with interval training and the rest of this stuff,
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:47.840]   which is phenomenal.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.280]   You know, weightlifting was introduced in my high school
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.320]   my senior year, you know, I lifted weights some,
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:54.800]   continued through college,
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.660]   little bit of time in a martial arts,
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:00.880]   ripped my knee apart in college in the martial arts.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:04.340]   But yeah, fitness has always been a part of my life
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:07.140]   as much for liking to be in condition
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:10.820]   and, you know, the spiritual regeneration of it,
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.520]   whether I knew what it was or not.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:16.140]   These days, you know, I'm looking for every hack there is.
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:18.400]   I know you don't like the term hack.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.340]   We like mechanisms.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.060]   Scientists like mechanisms.
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:23.200]   - Yeah, hack sort of implies that we're using one thing
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.400]   to accomplish something different.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:26.960]   I like mechanisms, but at the end of the day,
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.660]   if people want to call something a hack
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.500]   because it gets them the result they want
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.340]   or it's more appealing to apply the tool,
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.180]   that's what matters to me.
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:36.560]   You know, tools sitting in a box don't do anything.
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.700]   So if people are using them, then I'm good with the term.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:39.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:42.020]   So what these days, cold plunge, sauna,
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.820]   principally, I'm struggling with issues
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:46.660]   with a couple of joints that I know science
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.220]   will eventually help me regenerate.
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:51.740]   So in the meantime, good diet, you know, the basic pillars.
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:56.740]   Diet, not a perfect diet, but by and large,
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:00.100]   overall, my diet's pretty good.
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:06.340]   And then, you know, the little things.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.840]   Spiritual keeps me in shape physically.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:14.100]   Hitting a cold plunge is challenging
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.580]   psychologically and physically.
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:17.300]   And the sauna too. - It's a state shifter.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:18.740]   That's for sure.
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:21.820]   You don't need science to know that 30 seconds or a minute
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:25.380]   in that cold water is going to change your chemistry
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.620]   for a long while afterwards.
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.320]   And for the better, I believe.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.380]   Once you get out.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.380]   People forget this, they're like, I hate the cold.
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.460]   The point is not how you feel while you're in it.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.980]   You can feel proud of how you navigate that portion,
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:38.580]   but the point is how you feel afterwards.
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.640]   - Well, that's the old saying, why do you hit yourself
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.060]   in the hand with a hammer?
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.820]   'Cause it feels so good when you stop.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:44.980]   [laughing]
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.580]   - I like that, I like that.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.100]   Spoken like somebody who worked in New York City
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.840]   for a long time.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.620]   Out here, we'd probably say something different.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:54.860]   You know, it's like crystals in lava lamps or something.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:56.380]   Although there aren't many lava lamps anymore.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:58.660]   I think that the idea that California is all hippy dippy,
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:54:59.740]   that's not true anymore.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.900]   I think it's been overrun by other, a different ethos.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:06.060]   In any event, thanks for sharing that
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.920]   because I think that we can't separate the physical
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.300]   from the psychological, right?
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:13.980]   I mean, we've been talking about the mental
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:17.940]   and fatigue status of the people you're negotiating with
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:19.900]   oftentimes during this conversation.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:22.220]   But then of course, there's how you show up to the job.
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:23.820]   I mean, if you're run down three days
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.300]   and you've been in a fight with your spouse
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.700]   and that's still in the back of your mind
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:30.380]   and you're hungry, tired, sick,
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:34.260]   not connected to your higher power,
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.980]   all those things that there's no way you can be as effective
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:38.300]   at any job.
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.100]   So it's great to hear and not surprising to hear
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:45.060]   that you have bedrock practices that you implement.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:46.880]   Especially.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.720]   - Yeah, it's an interesting point.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.380]   Almost everybody I knew that was really good
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.660]   at anything they did for a living,
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:53.820]   they probably took pretty good care of themselves.
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:54.640]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:58.700]   You know, there's this, the language around self-care
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:00.300]   I think gets really distorted.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.800]   I'm going to editorialize for a second here.
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:04.200]   I think it, but I'm going to editorialize in line
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.520]   with what you just said.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:09.780]   You know, I think self-care sounds like navel gazing
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.540]   where people think that it's all about self,
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:15.920]   but it's actually taking care of oneself
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:18.360]   so that we can show up better for everybody else.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.300]   More energy, more capacity, more staying power
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.000]   to have those hard conversations
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.700]   with the people we care about
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:26.500]   and that move our life forward.
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.040]   So it's really refilling the fuel tank in my mind
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:35.040]   as opposed to the kind of egocentric, narcissistic,
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.640]   you know, stance that a lot of people take towards that.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.100]   And I understand why they do, you know,
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:45.020]   people scroll through Instagram and they see people,
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:48.260]   you know, selfing every muscle and like,
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:49.100]   and all this stuff.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:51.200]   And listen, I'm not disparaging what people want to do,
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.620]   but at the end of the day,
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:56.260]   self-care is about being more ready to do better
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.940]   for the world if you're mission oriented.
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:01.160]   - Agreed, completely agree.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.880]   - Do you think there's been a change in the FBI
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.060]   over the last three, 40 years around that?
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:09.360]   You know, I have this image in my mind of agents
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.660]   like sitting in cars for 20 hours, eating hoagie sandwiches
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:16.140]   and, you know, and looking through binoculars
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.300]   and running themselves into the ground
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:21.240]   with like this kind of bulldog-like persistence
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.460]   to get to solve the puzzle.
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:24.620]   I mean, put differently,
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:26.120]   I imagine there were some negotiations
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.800]   that were very long and fatiguing.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:32.340]   So do you recall one of the longer negotiations
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:33.180]   that you had?
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.680]   And how do you sleep at night midway
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.160]   through a hostage crisis?
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:41.640]   - So the longest one that I was directly involved in
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.040]   on almost day-to-day and hour-to-hour one
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:47.140]   went about three-ish days.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:51.600]   Washington, D.C., 2003, started the second Iraq war.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.680]   A guy named Dwight Watson rolled a tractor
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:56.240]   into the middle of D.C. and claimed he had four bombs
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.720]   and he left four bombs scattered around.
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.040]   The city.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.020]   - Had he actually done that or he was just caught?
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:02.860]   He was bluffing.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:03.680]   - He was bluffing.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.520]   He hadn't done either.
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:07.480]   And it started on St. Patrick's Day.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:10.400]   Kind of interesting, you know.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.000]   - Like the thing you said was in the Philippines.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000]   It's like national holiday.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.300]   - Yeah, holiday, right?
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:20.440]   Interesting for a whole bunch of reasons.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.440]   Now, I had to go home and go to sleep one night
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.120]   and when we were in the middle of that.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.760]   And then it was just, I don't remember having trouble
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.100]   going to sleep because I felt like I did a good job.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.000]   And that we handed, I handed the shift off
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.300]   to another hostage negotiator from the bureau
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:46.480]   who was effectively the team leader, Vince Delfonso.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.680]   And Vince was bringing a negotiator.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.520]   So, and the team that he was with.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.120]   I, you know, everybody was in good hands.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:55.080]   As a matter of fact, Vince almost kicked me out of the scene
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.700]   'cause I didn't want to go and he just kept saying,
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.760]   "Go home and get some sleep, go home and get some sleep."
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:02.040]   And finally, the fifth time he said it to me, I went home.
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.360]   So I felt like I was leaving things in really good hands.
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:07.860]   And when we were working kidnappings,
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.820]   we expected them to go for long periods of time.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.300]   And you just kind of gotta,
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:15.300]   if you have faith in the process
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:18.360]   and you feel like that you're doing the best
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:21.060]   that can be done, then I think you could sleep at night.
[01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:25.320]   I guess to answer that question.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:29.080]   You have to be careful whether you're working a case,
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:34.080]   a siege or anything in the bureau
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:37.100]   that you don't run yourself into the ground.
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:39.840]   And there was some cases I worked in the '90s
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:43.520]   where, I mean, like we knocked ourselves out.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:46.860]   Like we would, we worked hard on anybody we ever saw.
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:48.540]   But we occasionally, we took time off too.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:50.000]   You know, I worked with guys that realized
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.620]   that sometimes you gotta go out and have a beer,
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:55.280]   kick back and blow off some steam.
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:58.060]   So I think everybody that I ever worked with,
[01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:00.700]   we were occasionally cautious enough
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:02.940]   to recharge the batteries.
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:04.720]   And then depending upon the nature of the challenge
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:07.780]   in front of you, there was a siege in St. Martin's Parish
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:09.440]   and went six days.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:12.180]   I don't think those guys got a lot of sleep,
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:14.060]   but the nature of those sieges,
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:15.860]   that particular type of siege only lasts
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:17.180]   five or six days anyway.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:18.500]   You just gotta gut it out.
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:21.780]   - Were there ever instances where you're just trying
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:24.900]   to keep the person on the line so they can just raid?
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:28.400]   - You know, I never had to do that personally.
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.220]   You had to be prepared to do that
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:33.700]   from the very beginning of any siege.
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:35.140]   That you might have to get some,
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:39.320]   you might have to orchestrate an assault of some sort.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:43.300]   I was fortunate enough early on in my training,
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:45.700]   there's kind of a famous siege in,
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:49.300]   if you know hostage negotiation history in London,
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:51.640]   called the Princesgate Siege,
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:56.640]   where a legendary British hostage negotiator, David Van Ness,
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:58.940]   had the bad guys on the phone
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:01.640]   while the SAS was hitting the building.
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:04.740]   And I remember that we were shown like,
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:07.040]   look, there may come a time
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.260]   when you have to keep somebody on the phone
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:10.420]   when SWAT comes in.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.820]   That goes with the territory.
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.780]   So expect that's a possibility from the very beginning.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.740]   And it was a great siege.
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:21.760]   The bad guy, Salim, the photos of him after he was shot,
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.560]   the phone is within his reach.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:25.480]   David kept him on the phone.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.620]   I've heard the tapes.
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:31.360]   The breaching explosions were going on.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.700]   And Salim says, "I gotta go, I gotta go.
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:36.240]   "There's suspicious noises."
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.460]   And David Van Ness in his classic British accent said,
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:44.760]   "Salim, there are no suspicious noises.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:47.280]   "Now let's get back to talking about
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:51.000]   "how many people are going on the bus to the airport."
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:51.840]   Bam.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.320]   And they went in and I caught up with David
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.160]   a number of years later.
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:57.860]   I had a FBI, I had a presidential intern
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.360]   from the White House intern with me in the bureau.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.700]   We're drinking in a bar with David Van Ness.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.960]   I got a lot of stories where I'm drinking
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.880]   in a bar with somebody.
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:08.780]   And the intern walked around everybody
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.040]   and tapped David on the shoulder and he says,
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.020]   "Chris says you kept the terrorist on the phone
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:17.820]   "up 'til the moment that the SAS came in the door."
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:20.440]   And David says, "Yeah, and I'd have kept him on the phone
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:23.440]   "even longer if the SAS hadn't come in so soon."
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.180]   So why am I telling that story?
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:30.000]   If you're gonna get into that line of business,
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.340]   you gotta accept all the things and go with it.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.660]   And realize that it's not you that made the decision.
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.280]   Somebody else did.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:38.940]   You gotta implement the strategy.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:44.720]   - Do you remember a case in Sacramento
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:47.840]   where I think it was a youth gang
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.640]   took over like an electronics store.
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.680]   - The Good Guys Siege.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:54.600]   - Yeah, I remember this when I was a kid.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.900]   There are two things that stand out in my mind
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:57.740]   from when I was a kid.
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:58.840]   One was the--
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.660]   - Good Guys was the name of the electronics store.
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:03.100]   - Right, Good Guys was the electronics store
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:07.020]   and Bad Guys, so to speak, went in there, took them hostage.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.540]   And I must have been a kid.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:10.300]   This must have been like late.
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:13.820]   There was a late '80s or something like that.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:15.660]   I remember that case.
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.580]   - It was about 1990, it was either '89 or '90.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:20.660]   I knew one of the negotiators that was there.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.340]   - So I was born in '75.
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:25.700]   So, and as I recall, they ended up opening fire
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:28.100]   on a bunch of hostages who were laying down on the ground.
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:29.500]   Is that right?
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.700]   - They knew that they were getting ready
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:34.220]   to execute the hostages
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.940]   because they put bags over their heads.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:41.020]   And that whenever the bad guys do anything to dehumanize
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:44.820]   a hostage, it's easier to shoot somebody with a bag
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:47.140]   over their head than it is not
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:49.060]   because you can't see their face.
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:51.780]   And so the bad guys had begun that process
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:53.620]   and they knew they needed to assault.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:57.920]   - God forbid anyone should ever be taken hostage.
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.060]   I realize circumstances differ,
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:04.900]   but you just mentioned putting bags over their heads.
[02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:09.860]   There's this notion of sheeple that people will describe
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:15.040]   post hoc after something about how somebody walks
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.300]   into a building and tells people to put zip ties
[02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:20.020]   on their own ankles or go into a back room
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:21.340]   that nobody resists.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:24.360]   And that in retrospect, had somebody caused a commotion,
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:28.460]   they might have caused enough of a commotion
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.220]   to either run out or be let go.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:33.440]   And yet, of course, there's a very logical part
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.760]   of everybody's brain, I would hope that thinks,
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.500]   listen, this person is an aggressor.
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:39.020]   There's a gun in my face.
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:40.300]   Don't be an idiot, right?
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.380]   'Cause we also have heard of the case in New York City
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:44.540]   that I read about this in the newspaper.
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.440]   So presumably it's true where someone was held up
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:49.320]   at gunpoint and one of the women in the group
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.540]   that was held up said, what are you gonna do?
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.820]   Shoot us and the person shot them.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:54.300]   So that happens too.
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:59.300]   So, I don't know if there's a fair and safe answer
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:00.900]   to give people on this,
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:05.060]   but if you're told to do something by somebody
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:07.400]   and it's all happening in real time,
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:10.200]   I mean, you have to ask, do they want my money, my body,
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:13.480]   my life or some combination of the three in real time
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:16.280]   while under presumably significant duress.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:22.520]   But for hostages, like if they disobey, cause a commotion,
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.360]   is that extending their life
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:25.580]   or is it shortening their life?
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:28.340]   I guess it's very context dependent, right?
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:32.540]   The only thing that I could, without knowing the context,
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:34.260]   anything you could do to humanize yourself
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:36.980]   and comply with what the bad guys want
[02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:38.760]   increases your chance of survival.
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:43.900]   So let's say you got ordered to go in a back room.
[02:05:43.900 --> 02:05:45.560]   You could look at the hostage taker and say,
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:47.580]   I'll do whatever you say, I'm Chris.
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:52.080]   You know, drop your name on them in a way
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:54.040]   so that you go from being a faceless person
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:55.000]   to somebody with a name.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.760]   That increases the chances of your survival, humanization.
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.800]   Whatever you can do to comply simultaneously,
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.120]   become more of a human being,
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.400]   because it's the opposite of what I was talking about before.
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.600]   If you're easier to kill if you've been dehumanized,
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.320]   you're harder to kill if you've been humanized.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.800]   You're harder to harm.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:14.960]   Like maybe they're not gonna kill you,
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:16.480]   they're just gonna hurt you.
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:19.480]   They're less likely to harm you if they know your first name.
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.200]   How do you get them, as a hostage negotiator,
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.960]   if they talk about a hostage, I'll say, you know,
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.800]   you mean Sheila?
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:32.060]   Do you mean Rex?
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:35.720]   You know, I'll find a way to drop the person's name
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.800]   into the conversation.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.720]   So as soon as, if you can humanize
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:41.300]   just by getting them to know your name,
[02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.480]   you increase the chances of survivability,
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:46.800]   you increase the chances of being treated better.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.360]   And comply.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:51.260]   I'll do whatever you say, I'm Chris,
[02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:53.780]   is gonna start to move the odds in your favor.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:07:01.000]   You know that what you just described extends to science.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.780]   You know, I've talked before about my stance
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:07.780]   on animal research and why I choose to no longer do it.
[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:11.240]   I do think it has its place in making important discoveries
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.360]   that cannot be made on humans,
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.280]   but that eventually extend to-
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.240]   - But you don't wanna do it.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:17.080]   - I don't wanna do it.
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:17.900]   Personally, I don't wanna do it,
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:20.200]   and I don't wanna do primate work or large carnivore work
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.640]   or small carnivore work.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:22.960]   But the point I was going to make
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.880]   is that when you do primate work,
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:30.640]   they strongly discourage near forbid you
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.120]   from giving them names, give them numbers.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:39.540]   So it all falls in line with what you were talking about.
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:41.160]   'Cause the moment something has a name,
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:45.060]   it moves from being a research animal to a pet of sorts,
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:47.500]   and that makes it a relationship.
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:51.480]   So interesting how a name turns something from a,
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.640]   you know, it elevates something to a relationship,
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:57.160]   however insignificant, it's up a notch
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:58.840]   and into our empathy circuitry.
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:00.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:02.700]   - Which is perhaps the appropriate segue
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:04.320]   to talk about empathy.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.820]   This is a topic that you're spending a lot of time about.
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:08.160]   - At last.
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:11.160]   - You mentioned tactical empathy, this documentary.
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:12.720]   By the way, when is that going to be out
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:14.200]   or do we have some sense?
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:17.680]   - My guess is we'll finish jumping through all the hoops
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:21.280]   and probably have out at the beginning of next year.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:25.080]   We're, I'm currently working with William Morris and Dever
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:26.780]   on a couple of different projects.
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:29.120]   They've been enormously supportive
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:32.920]   and we've asked for their guidance on how to,
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.860]   the best time to get the documentary out
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:38.160]   and very happy with the people I'm dealing with there
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:43.120]   and actually stroke of the universe was looking out for me,
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.480]   funny set of circumstances and just really enjoy
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:46.840]   with the people that I'm working with there.
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:48.840]   So probably first part of next year.
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:49.680]   - Fantastic.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.560]   What's your take on empathy?
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.080]   I think of empathy in the pop culture sense of,
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.520]   somebody's feeling pain and we feel their pain,
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:01.920]   but of course empathy extends way beyond that.
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:04.280]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:07.920]   And that was Rob Malenka.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.360]   - Yeah, my colleague at Stanford.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.940]   - Yeah, I was really fascinated by the conversation
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:13.860]   that you had with him on that recently.
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:17.120]   And so, and he said, a lot of people use empathy
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:19.940]   a lot of different ways, sort of for their own meanings.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:24.940]   So, my take on empathy, tactical empathy,
[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:28.400]   also to keep throwing names out
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:29.940]   because people give me thoughts
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.340]   and I wanna source them out.
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:34.620]   I'm very close to Steven Kotler's perspective on it.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:37.060]   And Steven would say, empathy is about the transmission
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:39.480]   of information, compassion is the reaction
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:40.440]   to the transmission.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:41.280]   - I like that.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:43.160]   And by the way, I'm a fan of Steven's work.
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:47.000]   I think he's quite astute and a boy, is he a hard worker?
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.380]   He writes like a beast.
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.720]   He's up at like four in the morning.
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:52.000]   He also has like 50 chihuahuas or something crazy.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.140]   - Well, he's the way in the dogs.
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:56.280]   - Yeah, well, you can fit more chihuahuas in a room
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:57.500]   than any others.
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:09:58.440]   Gotcha, Steven.
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:03.500]   - But yeah, so, and that was when I was with the FBI,
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.220]   we started collaborating with Harvard
[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:09.220]   because the Harvard definition was empathy
[02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:11.460]   was not liking the other side.
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:12.680]   It was just demonstrating
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:14.940]   and understanding their perspective.
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:18.100]   Bob Mnookin's book "Beyond Winning's" chapter,
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.940]   "The Attention Between Empathy and Assertiveness,"
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:24.300]   he says the empathy is not agreeing, disagreeing,
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:26.260]   or even liking the other side,
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:29.860]   which sort of falls into what Steven talked about.
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:32.620]   You know, it's about the transmission of information.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:35.360]   Now, empathy is very compassionate thing to do,
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:40.060]   but it doesn't necessarily equate to compassion itself.
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:45.060]   If I make you feel heard by me saying to you
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:47.980]   what your perspective on something is,
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:51.660]   you're gonna feel cared for, you're gonna feel understood.
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:54.280]   It's gonna land with you really well.
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.060]   I don't necessarily have to feel compassion for you.
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:59.780]   I know it's a precursor to compassion.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:03.600]   So I would separate it from sympathy, clearly,
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.500]   and I would even separate it from compassion,
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.640]   although I know it's a very compassionate thing to do.
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:12.060]   It's about tactical empathy,
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:17.060]   is about me actively demonstrating verbally to you
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:20.500]   that I understand where you're coming from.
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:23.900]   Tactic, from the experience in hostage negotiators,
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:27.040]   backed up by neuroscience,
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.740]   is that people largely react negatively.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:32.220]   So the smarter move for me,
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:35.620]   instead of trying to reinforce a positive,
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:37.800]   is to first deactivate the negative
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.780]   by simply calling it out, calling the elephant room out.
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:43.860]   Don't deny the elephant, don't ignore the elephant.
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:45.340]   Call the elephant a room out.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:49.240]   Say, it's probably gonna sound like I'm greedy.
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.740]   If I expect that you're gonna think I'm overreaching.
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:55.220]   I'm not gonna say, I don't want you to think I'm greedy.
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.600]   I'm gonna say, it's probably gonna seem greedy.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.540]   So simply well-educated emotional intelligence influence,
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:04.260]   gun instinct influence,
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:07.260]   on what the other side is thinking and feeling.
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:08.660]   If I can define it in that way,
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:10.120]   then it becomes an unlimited skill.
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:15.120]   If it requires me to have compassion for you when I don't,
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.340]   then that limits my ability to use empathy.
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:20.740]   And I'm not interested in having that ability to be limited.
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:23.320]   I want it to be an unlimited skill.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.220]   So if you just define it strictly
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:28.640]   in terms of transmission of information,
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:34.460]   then it's not sympathy or compassion or liking or agreeing.
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:37.280]   It has a very powerful effect.
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:41.220]   It at least feels like compassion to the other side.
[02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:44.860]   It reacts with the emotional circuitry, the neurochemicals
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:48.180]   that everybody has to some degree if they're alive,
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:50.020]   even if they're on the spectrum,
[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:53.580]   they have some of that going on inside.
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:57.760]   And of what I've read on even the mental illnesses,
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:00.940]   in my last century training,
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:03.180]   I saw people who were paranoid schizophrenic
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:05.660]   is it effectively be more of a wiring problem
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:09.440]   and a chemical problem for a layman's description.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.280]   And a lot of what I've read said empathy
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.660]   is even effective with paranoid schizophrenics.
[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:19.660]   People, regardless of how disarray the circuitry
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:24.660]   in their head is, it helps them on some level
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:26.920]   to feel understood.
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:30.580]   So empathy is just about letting somebody feel understood.
[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:32.980]   Example, when I'm working terrorism,
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:37.980]   we had a lot of Arab Muslims testify in open civilian court
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:43.580]   against a legitimate Muslim cleric, who was also a criminal,
[02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:46.060]   who also committed crimes.
[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:49.500]   And I would sit down with them
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:51.460]   and I'd say to them right off the bat,
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:53.220]   'cause I know where they're coming from,
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.920]   you believe that there's been a succession
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:56.940]   of American governments for the last 200 years
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:59.180]   that have been anti-Islamic.
[02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:03.100]   And they'd look at me and they'd go like, yeah.
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:07.980]   I never said it was true, I never said I agreed,
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.140]   I never said I disagreed.
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:13.420]   By me simply articulating what their perspective
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:16.180]   on the interaction was, they were so startled by it,
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:18.040]   it was empathy.
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:23.340]   And we were so good at that, empathy,
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:27.140]   frequently in that timeframe, they would say,
[02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:29.500]   "Are you Muslim?"
[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:31.560]   And I'd say, "No, I respect the religion.
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:35.760]   If you need to know, I'm a Christian,
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:39.340]   but I respect your religion and I got no problem saying
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:41.060]   to you where you're coming from,
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:44.260]   that's empathy from my definition."
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:46.140]   And then it becomes an unlimited skill.
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:47.720]   I don't have to feel it,
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:52.620]   I don't have to necessarily wanna do anything about it.
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:55.380]   Goldman says there's cognitive empathy,
[02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:58.840]   me just recognizing where your emotions are coming from,
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:02.400]   there's emotional empathy, me feeling your emotions,
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.060]   and there's empathic concern,
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:07.060]   me wanting to do something about your distress.
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:13.420]   My version of tactical empathy probably brings those
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:17.360]   into play in sequence on a continuum of sorts,
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.140]   but none of them are precursors.
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.220]   It's just me showing to you that I understand
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:22.380]   where you're coming from.
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:25.180]   And it has a phenomenally favorable impact
[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:26.180]   on the interaction.
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:30.020]   - Tell me about mirroring as a tool.
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:32.980]   - Yeah, mirroring is one of the simplest,
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:38.540]   easiest, and most effective of the skillset.
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.960]   Takes the least amount of brain power.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.560]   It's just repeating one to three-ish words
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.520]   of what somebody has just said.
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:48.900]   Can be one, it should never usually be more than five.
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:51.580]   Hostage negotiators learn it by repeating the last
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:53.700]   one to three words that somebody's just said.
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:55.720]   It doesn't have to be the last one to three words.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:57.580]   And a mirroring is not the body language mirror.
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:00.780]   It's not mimicking anybody physically,
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:03.740]   and it's not mimicking their tone of voice
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:07.140]   or their affect or anything about them.
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:11.120]   It's just repeating one to three-ish words.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:14.260]   We found that access is, for whatever part of the brain
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:15.980]   that you gotta energize to do it,
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:17.780]   it's a different part of the brain than labeling.
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:19.780]   People are usually either really good at labeling,
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:23.700]   like I label, almost everybody on my team labels a lot.
[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:26.580]   Sounds like this is bothering you.
[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:29.580]   Sounds like, seems like you're just not really sure
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:31.320]   where this is going.
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:34.420]   And the mirror, I gotta consciously make it a point
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:38.460]   to mirror, and what's a mirror used for?
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:40.760]   It's in place of what did you mean by that?
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:44.280]   Or would you please go on?
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:47.340]   Or I don't understand, could you repeat that again?
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:50.680]   So I'll listen for stuff that either I don't understand
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:54.640]   or I need you to talk more about,
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.900]   and instead of saying, could you say some more about that,
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:00.020]   I'll just mirror the words.
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.640]   Now, for whatever reason,
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.340]   it connects the thoughts in your head.
[02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:11.140]   The message, the way that lands is I heard what you said,
[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:15.820]   the words, I got the words, 'cause I just repeated them,
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:18.200]   and I still don't understand.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:20.740]   So I need a more in-depth explanation
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:23.980]   without using the same words that you just used.
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:28.980]   Because if you say, I think isopracism is useless,
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:34.880]   and I might say, what do you mean by that?
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:36.940]   And you go, isopracism is useless.
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:39.040]   You repeat the same words only louder.
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:40.980]   You figure that saying it louder
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:43.700]   will make it penetrate my cranium.
[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:44.640]   That doesn't work.
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:49.860]   I need you to explain, to go into more depth,
[02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:52.080]   to expand using different words.
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.680]   And for whatever reason, we found as hostage negotiators,
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.560]   and I find in business that if I mirror you,
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:03.140]   you'll expand and you'll connect.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:06.220]   So I use it in that context.
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:10.580]   I might use it to get you to hear yourself out loud.
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:13.320]   Like if what you just said doesn't make sense,
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:16.120]   I'll repeat it back word for word,
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:19.100]   one to three words, and I'll upward inflect.
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:22.000]   I'll say, that doesn't make sense.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.600]   You know, use my tone, make it land with my tone,
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:26.560]   so you can hear yourself out loud.
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:29.580]   Somebody else just pointed out to me the other day
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:32.600]   that if you're talking to somebody,
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:33.740]   and they're in mid-thought,
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:35.500]   and their voice trails off
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:38.700]   because they sort of lost their train of thought,
[02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:40.980]   if you mirror them there,
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:45.220]   that helps them get their train of thought back and expand.
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:50.220]   So it's a ridiculously effective communication tool
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:53.360]   to get people to expand and feel heard.
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:57.380]   Its simplicity puts some people off.
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:58.460]   There are some people that say,
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:18:59.540]   "Eh, it sounds stupid.
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:01.300]   I don't see what good that will do."
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:05.160]   I always notice if somebody really wants to know
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:09.480]   about mirroring, my description is they're both high IQ
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:12.160]   and high EQ, and why does that work?
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:14.120]   A high IQ guy's going to want to know something
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:16.960]   that's really simple that doesn't take any effort to do,
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:19.040]   and that's what a mirror does.
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:20.640]   It's really, really effective,
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:23.640]   and it's almost no effort on your part at all.
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.800]   - Interesting.
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.180]   I must say that neuroscience
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:29.380]   has an unfortunate dearth of knowledge
[02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:31.860]   about how brains interact.
[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:33.560]   This is starting to change,
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.860]   but most of what we know about how brains work
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:37.000]   is from putting people
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.300]   into functional magnetic resonance imaging machines,
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:43.220]   so-called MRI, exposing them to movies
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:45.680]   or games that they have to play, et cetera,
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.360]   and then looking at brain state activation.
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.600]   There are a few laboratories starting to look
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:54.740]   at how people interact in real time
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:58.520]   with both people in separate MRI machines
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:00.640]   that hopefully we'll be able to parse some of this,
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.960]   and I'm certain that somebody hearing this
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:06.380]   will use this knowledge to go do the experiment.
[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:08.400]   If not, I'll run it up the flagpole
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:11.240]   to some highly qualified people at Stanford
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:12.080]   who could do this,
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:13.340]   because it'd be fun to see what's happening,
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:15.880]   but I have the sense that what's happening
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:19.620]   is that there is a real merge of cognition
[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:23.920]   when one hears their own words spoken back to them,
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:27.200]   and that you've now got two brains
[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:28.720]   processing the same information,
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:30.760]   and that has to lead new places,
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:34.320]   so I don't have any insight
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.860]   as to what exactly is happening,
[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:40.440]   but certainly that something is happening there,
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:42.500]   evidenced by the real-world results that you're getting.
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:45.280]   We don't need experiments to tell us that,
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:47.260]   but it'd be interesting to see
[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:48.620]   and learn a bit of what's happening.
[02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:49.920]   If there's a fusion, for instance,
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:52.880]   of a co-activation of emotional centers,
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:54.680]   co-activation of...
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:57.540]   There's something about hearing our own voice
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.500]   that's very different than hearing other people's voices.
[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:01.320]   Most people cringe when they hear their own voice
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:02.220]   on recording.
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:06.100]   Most, not all.
[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:08.720]   Some people are in love with their own voice.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:10.480]   We know these people,
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:14.380]   but we know that our auditory system cancels out
[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:16.160]   the hearing of our own voice.
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:16.980]   Did you know that?
[02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:18.360]   As we're talking now, our auditory system
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:20.000]   is suppressing our own voice.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.920]   We don't really hear ourselves speak
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.520]   the same way that when you speak, I hear you speak.
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:29.360]   Yeah, so it's an active neurochemical inhibition
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:31.020]   of the response, and it's amazing too,
[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:33.400]   because as we grow up, our voice changes.
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:35.640]   Puberty and so forth, and other ways too,
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:38.120]   that the vocal cords change in thickness, et cetera.
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:41.440]   And our voice changes, but we always know self
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:42.760]   from other in terms of voice,
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:46.280]   and we cancel out our actual auditory perception
[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:48.080]   of our own voice. - That's fascinating.
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:50.000]   - And breathing and heartbeat.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:54.360]   We shut down our response to self actively within the brain.
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:55.680]   - That's fascinating.
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:58.200]   - So maybe hearing back some of what we just said
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:01.400]   allows us to actually hear what we just said.
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:02.240]   - Yeah, well true.
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:04.880]   And that's why people, sometimes all somebody needs
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:05.920]   is a sounding board.
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:10.160]   So they can, somebody else can hear,
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:12.440]   they can hear themselves out and get repeated back to them.
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:15.280]   And then they go like, wait a minute, did I just say that?
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:17.240]   Yeah, interesting.
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.720]   - Interesting.
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:20.320]   - Useful.
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:21.160]   - Indeed.
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:23.840]   Proactive listening.
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:25.240]   Tell us about proactive listening.
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:28.280]   We're all told that we need to be better listeners.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:29.640]   You know, the other day someone said,
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:31.000]   we got two ears and one mouth,
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.480]   as if that's supposed to remind us.
[02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:35.960]   Most people have two ears and one mouth,
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:36.800]   but I get the point.
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:39.880]   They were saying, hey, there's value in listening.
[02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:41.080]   And more often than not,
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:44.560]   we default to broadcast, but no reception.
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:46.840]   We're mostly broadcast, less reception.
[02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:48.080]   - Right.
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.560]   - Hence the call for nasal breathing.
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:53.320]   It's useful in a lot of circumstances
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:55.480]   'cause it keeps us, it keeps our mouth shut.
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.720]   [laughing]
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:00.520]   What is proactive listening?
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:01.640]   How do we do it?
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:02.480]   What's it good for?
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:04.040]   - I'm really trying to get people out of the notion
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:06.520]   of active listening just because active listening
[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:09.560]   has been so overused that people have lost track of it.
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:12.360]   And most of it is taught poorly
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.360]   and it's interactive or it's proactive.
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.600]   And so we learned as hostage negotiators,
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:21.160]   first of all, just to label the presenting emotion.
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:22.280]   And we just assumed that,
[02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:24.920]   and the presenting emotion was always anger of some form,
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:28.160]   anger upset, on certain rare instances,
[02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:29.840]   the guy was under control,
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.480]   but they were almost always negative emotion.
[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:36.400]   So we just assumed that it was defined to what was confined
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.040]   to what was driving hostage takers was negativity.
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:44.080]   Now, if I may, 'cause I feel like an imposter
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.080]   talking about neuroscience to you.
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:50.240]   - Your knowledge of neuroscience is spot on, Vos.
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:52.840]   I want to say numerous times you've asked me
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:54.440]   about things in neuroscience
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:56.040]   and you've never been off the mark.
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:57.120]   - Oh, thank you.
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:58.640]   - You've clearly done your homework too.
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:00.760]   - We keep trying to learn about it.
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.240]   But layman's terminology,
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:06.560]   the survival brain is largely negative.
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:10.280]   Ballpark, I would say 75% negative.
[02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:11.880]   Your reactions are gonna be negative.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:15.520]   So number one, I believe that's principally backed up
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:16.920]   by the experiments of neuroscience,
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:20.320]   the FMRIs that you alluded to.
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:23.120]   And so then in hostage negotiation,
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:25.960]   we were taught to basically label the presenting emotion.
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:31.960]   And then I'd seen experimentation
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:34.160]   or reporting of experiments.
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:35.640]   I think the first time I read about it
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:38.200]   was in a book called "The Upward Spiral."
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.400]   And that book is a good 10 years old, I think,
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:44.200]   which means the neuroscience is evolving.
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:46.520]   But primarily the experiment there
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:47.640]   that I remember reading about it
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:49.360]   and read about in other places,
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.040]   that if people were undergoing a negative emotion
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:57.640]   in my layman's paraphrase of the experiment,
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:24:59.200]   they're showing a picture
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:01.480]   that induced a negative emotion in their head.
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:02.520]   And then they asked people
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:04.840]   to simply call out what the emotion was.
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:09.000]   And when they self-labeled, then the emotion diminished.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.360]   Now the degree of diminishment varies,
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:15.960]   but the percentage of time that it diminishes
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:20.120]   by simply by calling it out is just darn near all the time.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:23.760]   So for largely 75% negative,
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:28.760]   and we can deactivate the negativity by calling it out,
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.920]   well, let's be proactive.
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:35.720]   If you're a human being and we're engaged in a negotiation,
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:39.040]   there's gonna be certain very predictable negativity
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:40.840]   that's going to be there.
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:43.880]   And I should be proactive in calling it out,
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:46.440]   anticipating the negativity is gonna be there
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:50.720]   based on a circumstance that's highly predictable.
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:53.120]   And your gut instinct before that you were referring to
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:53.960]   when you wanna say,
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:56.280]   "Look, I don't want you to think I'm being greedy."
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.360]   Your gut's telling you it's highly predictable,
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.520]   you're gonna come off as greedy.
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:02.360]   So let me be proactive and say,
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:05.320]   "It's probably gonna seem like I'm being greedy."
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:07.920]   And that's the dialing over
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:11.640]   to what is eminently predictable in the interaction
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:13.000]   and just being proactive
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.080]   to deactivate the negative emotions
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.960]   that either are taking place or what our experience has found
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:23.560]   and I haven't seen any science that has yet
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:26.640]   that has had the opportunity to back this up.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:28.560]   It inoculates.
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:29.760]   I can create a barrier.
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:31.600]   If I call out a negative that's not there,
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:35.700]   it doesn't plant it, it actually inoculates you from it.
[02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:38.560]   And I've done this in practice.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.680]   I was given a lecture a couple of years ago.
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.860]   Anybody asks a question,
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:45.760]   I try to find the value in the question
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:48.000]   no matter how bad the question is.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.520]   This poor guy asked me a question
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:54.080]   that I just cannot find a single component in his question
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:56.840]   that demonstrates that he was listening or paying attention.
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.620]   There was nothing about it that I could congratulate him on.
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:04.720]   And so I said, "This is gonna sound harsh
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:07.760]   because I know the answer I'm getting ready to give him
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.720]   is gonna make it sound like to the group
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:11.800]   that I think he's stupid."
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:14.760]   I just, I can't think of a way to respond to this
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:16.360]   without saying effectively like,
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.800]   "What are you thinking about?
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:20.740]   That's got nothing to do with what we're talking about."
[02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:23.080]   So I go, "This is gonna sound harsh."
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:26.580]   And I answer the question and he just kind of goes, "Okay."
[02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:29.040]   And I start answering somebody else's question
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.660]   and he goes, "That wasn't harsh."
[02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:36.280]   Now, if I hadn't said this is gonna sound harsh
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:39.320]   and answered the question,
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:42.460]   I guarantee you my answer would have embarrassed him.
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:46.320]   And embarrassment is one of the worst negative emotions
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:47.840]   you can inflict on anybody.
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:50.580]   And he would hate me to this day for embarrassing him.
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:56.200]   So I got a moment coming at me that is predictably negative
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:00.080]   and I can let that train run me down
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:02.040]   or I can call it out in advance
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:06.800]   and get a reaction where the guy says, "That wasn't that bad."
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:10.760]   And that's what being proactive about the emotions is about.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:12.000]   - I love it.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.760]   And I'm recalling an instance during graduate school
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:17.200]   where my graduate advisor who sadly has passed away
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.760]   but was a phenomenal scientist, I mean, just so pure,
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:23.160]   insisted on getting the answers,
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:25.000]   could emotionally detach from the answers.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000]   I mean, she's just was a ninja.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.440]   She used to come into the laboratory
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:32.680]   when we were working on a paper and she'd sit down
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:35.740]   and she'd say, "You're gonna hate me
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:38.420]   for what I'm about to ask you to do."
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:40.520]   And I think, "Oh no, like I'm gonna have to redo
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.140]   all the analysis or I'm gonna like some monumental thing."
[02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:47.240]   And then she'd say, "You gotta change
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:49.820]   the like fonts in figure two."
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:54.900]   Oh my godly, what do you mean I wanna hate you?
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:55.740]   - It was a relief.
[02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:58.980]   - But I wanted nothing more than to make her happy
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:01.340]   with my work because I respected the standard
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:04.240]   that she held so greatly.
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:07.500]   I mean, she could have asked me to stand on my head
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:09.060]   and do the experiments 50 times.
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:10.300]   I would probably would have done it
[02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:12.080]   if I thought they would make the project better.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.960]   And as a consequence, she would have been pleased
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:16.640]   because she was the standard for me
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:17.920]   and in many ways still is.
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:20.120]   But I'm wondering if she read your book
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:24.180]   because she used to presage these requests
[02:29:24.180 --> 02:29:25.760]   with like, "You're gonna hate me."
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:26.600]   And then she'd ask me for something.
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:28.720]   I'm like, "Oh, I hate you, like that's nothing."
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:31.200]   But now I wonder if I would have been taken aback
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:35.580]   if she had just said, "Hey, by the way,
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:37.120]   figure two needs redoing."
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:39.640]   I might've been kind of bristled by that.
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:42.880]   So maybe she read your book, Chris.
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:46.080]   These are great tools, mirroring and proactive listening.
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.400]   And thank you for sharing these.
[02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:48.440]   - Of course.
[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:50.920]   - Did you ever employ the family members of kidnappers,
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:53.000]   friends of kidnappers as a means
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.280]   to tap into a different aspect of their psyche?
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:00.000]   'Cause I think that we are all as human beings
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.560]   very context driven.
[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:05.400]   So I can imagine that the person who kidnapped somebody
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:10.400]   or who's trying to steal somebody's resources
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:13.080]   is in a particular groove of person.
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:16.280]   And I do think there are people in the world
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:18.200]   who are just evil.
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:21.160]   But I also know because I've read about it
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:22.940]   and I trust the sources that there are people
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:26.280]   who have done horrendous things who love their dog
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:28.680]   and genuinely love their dog and wouldn't harm an animal.
[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:30.800]   But I'm not trying to give these people a pass,
[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:34.600]   but I could imagine that those other facets to somebody
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:38.400]   represent really good entry points for allowing them
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:42.320]   to see the kind of incongruence in their behavior.
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:45.840]   Or is it the case that when these are high stress situations
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:48.080]   that you just have to basically, you know,
[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:51.520]   you have to attack the, you know, disarm the aggressor
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:54.160]   and you're just focusing on the person as the bad actor,
[02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:57.320]   not considering the other contexts of their lives.
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.320]   - All right, so let's draw a distinction
[02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:03.440]   between a hostage takers in a contained situation
[02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:07.960]   and kidnappers, uncontained, unknown location.
[02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:10.040]   So you're probably asking about somebody
[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:13.720]   in a contained situation, bad guys in a bank,
[02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:17.800]   Dwight Watson in his tractor in Washington, DC.
[02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:20.720]   So very counterintuitively,
[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:22.760]   if they're in a contained situation,
[02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:24.520]   there's a saying out there that says the system
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:27.240]   that you're employing is perfectly designed
[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:29.300]   to give you the outcome that you have.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:35.960]   So bad guy, Dwight Watson is on his tractor in DC.
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:41.920]   The family's part of the system that put him there.
[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:45.520]   The blunt, harsh reality of that is.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:48.560]   Now at that siege that went on long enough
[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.840]   and it was so high profile,
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:51.680]   some of his family members showed up.
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:56.520]   Now we can, we could and did try to use them.
[02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:59.440]   I'm walking from one place to another
[02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:04.920]   from the negotiation operation cell component
[02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:07.960]   on the way to command post, hostage negotiator stops me,
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:10.400]   a couple of people with him, it's Watson's family.
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:14.400]   And they see I'm in a hurry
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:16.240]   and that I'm not interested in being stopped.
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:18.080]   And they got to say to me something to stop me
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:20.760]   and get my attention.
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:24.080]   And they go, look, our brother's just hurting in his heart.
[02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:25.040]   He's just hurting.
[02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:28.320]   You know, things have gone bad for our whole family
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.920]   and he's just hurting his heart.
[02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:32.920]   Don't kill him over that.
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:36.280]   And I looked at the negotiator and I said,
[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:41.280]   get that on tape and we'll play that for him.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:44.580]   Because if we can get that on tape
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:48.160]   exactly the way they said it, that'll land.
[02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:49.720]   But if we put them on a phone with them,
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:51.720]   they're going to try to reason with them.
[02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:55.840]   And they're going to say stuff to them that didn't help,
[02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:57.480]   which they don't very well intention,
[02:32:57.480 --> 02:33:00.080]   but it's going to be counterintuitive.
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:02.340]   And it's probably going to make it worse.
[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:06.600]   So you have to understand family can be extremely important
[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:09.560]   if you can get them to say exactly the right thing.
[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:13.280]   And it's probably going to need to be highly orchestrated
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:17.520]   because you know how it's going to land.
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:21.120]   And unfortunately, if you get them in a direct conversation,
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:23.200]   it'll probably renew an old wound.
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:25.240]   You know, family members have hurt each other
[02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:27.940]   in ways that they have no idea even happened.
[02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:31.600]   And so the other, you know, a family member,
[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:33.500]   my son to this day remembers when I told him
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:35.240]   Santa Claus wasn't real.
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:37.080]   And I have no-- - Wait, what?
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:39.600]   - I have no memory of that conversation.
[02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.620]   I'm sorry, I blew it for you, right?
[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:42.800]   - Wait, we got, oh my goodness.
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:44.880]   - But family members have hurt each other over the years
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:46.620]   that they have no idea which comes up
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:48.960]   in these live conversations.
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:50.920]   And you don't know what wounds,
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:53.600]   you don't even know what wounds are there that you caused.
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:55.960]   And so in a contained situation,
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:59.340]   a family member can be extremely helpful,
[02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:02.960]   but it has to be, it's a surgical shot
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:05.960]   that you have to be really, really, really careful with.
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:07.400]   Otherwise it can go the other way
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:10.000]   because wounds and people don't even know are there.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.400]   - Gosh, that's such a psychologically astute way
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:14.980]   of viewing it because I'm a big fan
[02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:17.480]   of the so-called family systems model of psychology.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.000]   I mean, you can't look at any human being psychology
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.860]   positive, meaning adaptive or maladaptive psychology
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:27.000]   and not look at the family system at which that evolved,
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.480]   which is not to say that some perfectly healthy families
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.680]   occasionally don't have issues
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:32.600]   with a child having mental illness.
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:34.400]   And I mean, that happens,
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.400]   but I'm told that 99.9% of the time,
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:44.280]   you can identify a family system organization
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:46.840]   or a lineage, a genetic tie, et cetera,
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:49.880]   that makes things start to make sense
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.840]   when somebody is really struggling.
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:54.040]   And as you pointed out, sadly,
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:57.800]   oftentimes that involves pains of past.
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:00.880]   Wow, well, thanks for sharing that
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:04.440]   because I think that in my mind, the movie version of it is,
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:06.240]   they bring the mother in and it's like,
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:07.640]   "Billy, don't do it."
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:11.640]   As you said, that might be the time
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:14.720]   when Billy's really going to let his mother know,
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:19.000]   childhood sucked for Billy, right?
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.420]   And that's not what you want.
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:21.540]   - Yeah.
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:22.380]   - Goodness.
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:23.920]   What a complex job.
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:28.640]   What a complex high stakes, high consequence job.
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.540]   What did you do to unload some of the heaviness?
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.220]   I'm not just talking about getting a good night's sleep
[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:37.760]   or having a beer with your coworkers afterward,
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:40.200]   although those things serve important roles
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:42.640]   for people I realize.
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:48.400]   Do you think we can dump the hard stuff in our head
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:53.400]   and our hearts in a way that allows us to be functional?
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:56.340]   'Cause people in your line of work,
[02:35:56.340 --> 02:35:57.880]   and I think just anyone in the world,
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:01.080]   you live long enough, you're going to experience loss.
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:03.000]   - Yeah, you're going to get kicked in the gut.
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.880]   - Yeah, and you're going to see people you care about
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:06.080]   get kicked in the gut.
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:08.960]   There's so much beauty to life as well,
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:11.080]   but that's the reality.
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:16.080]   So do you have tools, processes that you use
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:18.980]   to kind of dump the baggage
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:20.680]   so that you can lean into your relationships
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:22.360]   and your relationship to yourself
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:26.720]   with a restored sense of optimism?
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:32.560]   - Yeah, I think most of the people
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:34.120]   that I've always worked around,
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:39.560]   we've been very reinforcing of one another,
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:44.420]   comedically, emotionally, friendship-wise,
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.840]   being able to laugh with each other,
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:49.240]   taking it easy on each other,
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:53.360]   getting people, laughter and genuine understanding
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:58.360]   without somebody trying to tell you that you did wrong.
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:02.140]   I've been lucky enough to either find myself
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.840]   in those groups most of the time,
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.700]   or we just evolved it.
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:08.920]   That's just the way that we were.
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:12.120]   We were attracted to one another emotionally,
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:13.840]   psychologically because of that.
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:17.160]   That's probably it mostly.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:20.400]   I've tried to parse some of these emotions out recently.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:23.680]   I'm not particularly proud of anything I've ever done,
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:26.200]   but I always felt like it was a privilege.
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:28.440]   You must be proud of your accomplishments.
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:29.720]   I don't know that it's pride,
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.200]   but there's other satisfaction that I get out of it.
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:36.720]   And so thinking about what drives me also now
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:37.840]   that I'm running a company
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:41.360]   and I've got people, also entrepreneurs,
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:43.760]   that are trying to do the best for their employees,
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.840]   what do we encourage in one another
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.360]   so that whatever we're doing, people feel good about it.
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:53.040]   And I've tried to take a lot of that
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:56.200]   from what I learned as an FBI agent
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:59.640]   and a hostage negotiator and the people that I was around.
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:01.820]   And we did joke with each other a lot
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:05.360]   and we did play tricks on each other,
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:07.960]   good-natured humor.
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:10.760]   Avoid the people that are running you down,
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:14.840]   but be able to take some good-natured ribbing
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:15.680]   every now and then.
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.280]   And I think humor is one way or another
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:21.280]   combined with hard work and an appreciation
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:23.040]   for what you're doing.
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:27.880]   It's probably been most of the mental health along the way.
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:30.360]   Occasional bourbon.
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:31.560]   (laughs)
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:32.400]   - Love it.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:35.240]   We did a whole episode on alcohol
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:36.760]   and so people are gonna hear me say, "Love it,"
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.280]   and think, "Wait, here, I'm supporting."
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:41.940]   Listen, the data say as long as you're not an alcoholic,
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:44.200]   as long as you are of age,
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:48.120]   probably two drinks a week or less is safe.
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:50.120]   Make 'em good, high-quality drinks
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:51.600]   if you're gonna have them.
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:53.040]   Consume them in the right context
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.120]   or don't consume them at all.
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:56.200]   But that's why I said love it.
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:38:59.520]   I support your love of bourbon.
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:04.000]   I'm not a bourbon drinker, but tell me a little bit more
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.440]   about what you're up to lately.
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:08.980]   You alluded to it a moment ago that you're running teams
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:09.820]   that are doing a lot.
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.640]   So you're in charge of a lot of people now,
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:13.840]   helping people, help people,
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:15.120]   providing a lot of service in the world
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:17.720]   through a lot of different channels.
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:19.920]   First of all, I wanna say that your book,
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:21.640]   "Never Split the Difference,"
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:22.740]   one of my favorite books.
[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:23.580]   - Thank you.
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:24.520]   - I don't say that lightly.
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:26.360]   I don't endorse books very often,
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:28.160]   but the books I do endorse, I love, love, love.
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:32.320]   I also have to say that it's a toss-up between your book,
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:34.600]   "Never Split the Difference,"
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:37.180]   and "The Body Keeps the Score"
[02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:40.640]   for the award for best titles of any book.
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.960]   Those are just like amazing titles, amazing, amazing titles.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:47.200]   - Tal-Raz, our co-writer, came up with the title.
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:48.720]   - Yeah, it's a phenomenal title.
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:51.720]   That and "The Body Keeps the Score,"
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:54.320]   because there's so much contained in the title,
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:57.460]   and then the book exceeds expectations.
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:39:59.520]   So a really amazing book.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:03.080]   People should listen to it, read it if they haven't already.
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:04.440]   But you're doing a lot more right now
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:07.080]   than just writing,
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:07.920]   although I want to hear about
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:09.440]   your other book projects as well.
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:12.460]   But before you list off the number of things you're doing,
[02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:14.120]   tell me first about Fireside,
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:18.060]   'cause this sounds like a really interesting endeavor
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:21.520]   that, frankly, I haven't heard of before.
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:22.600]   What's Fireside?
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:25.160]   - A brand new social media platform.
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:27.560]   It's essentially an interactive podcast.
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:29.480]   It's a subscription service
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:32.540]   founded by Fallon Fattermy and Mark Cuban.
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:34.620]   Fallon and I have been friends for a number of years.
[02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:37.100]   She was Google's youngest employee.
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:39.420]   She's an entrepreneur, dynamic, smart,
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:40.980]   hard-charging person.
[02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:47.160]   And it sort of grew out of what's inadequate
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:49.860]   in some of the social media apps that are out there,
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:55.100]   trying to combine the best ideas of a few different things.
[02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:57.000]   And Fallon suggested it to me,
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.240]   and I thought I'll jump in because she's a visionary.
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:02.660]   And what it's turned out to be is it's effectively
[02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:05.920]   weekly interactive group coaching.
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:10.560]   And you get the app off your iPhone or your Android,
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:13.080]   whatever platform your phone is on,
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:15.000]   and then you log in.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000]   We do an hour once a week,
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.860]   and you're getting group coaching,
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:21.140]   and then you get asked questions,
[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:22.820]   and it's got a video component to it.
[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:24.720]   So if you want to ask a question,
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:27.380]   we're going to bring you up on quote stage,
[02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:29.920]   and I get to see you and talk directly to you,
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:32.620]   and you get to see me and talk directly to me,
[02:41:32.620 --> 02:41:35.220]   or I interviewed Mark Cuban a couple of weeks ago,
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:38.500]   and people got to come on and ask Mark questions,
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:40.040]   or ask me questions.
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:43.620]   And what it has turned out to be is it's one of,
[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:48.620]   sort of the next level of how to get better at negotiations
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:50.760]   after you've read the book
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:53.320]   and probably taken a masterclass.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:55.140]   You know, where do you go next?
[02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:57.980]   One of the people that came on the podcast the other day,
[02:41:57.980 --> 02:42:01.680]   the fireside episode, they said,
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:03.840]   "Well, I don't have enough money yet
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:06.200]   "to go to your in-person training events,
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:08.060]   "'cause those are expensive,
[02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:10.520]   "and this is how I'm going to get better in the meantime
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:13.400]   "and work my way in that direction."
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:16.040]   And so the monthly coaching,
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:18.700]   if you were to sign up for group coaching from us
[02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:21.000]   on a regular basis, on a monthly basis,
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.780]   it would probably easily cost you,
[02:42:23.780 --> 02:42:26.920]   for what we're providing, $25,000, $30,000 a month.
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:30.660]   And this is 1,000 a year.
[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:35.660]   So at scale, it's an opportunity to interact directly with me
[02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:37.780]   and the members on my team once a week
[02:42:37.780 --> 02:42:38.820]   and get group coaching.
[02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:40.380]   And it's just kind of fun.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:41.380]   We're getting a kick out of it.
[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:44.580]   And people that really, really care
[02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:47.460]   about interacting well with people.
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:51.420]   Guy comes on the first episode I did, and he said,
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:54.020]   "Besides the fact that you helped me make a lot more money,
[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:55.960]   "you helped me save my marriage."
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:00.260]   And he just needed to know how to talk more genuinely
[02:43:00.260 --> 02:43:03.980]   and honestly with his wife
[02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:07.100]   in a way that made her felt heard.
[02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:11.380]   And he didn't really have a good way to do that beforehand.
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:12.940]   And I was just like,
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:16.100]   that's a lot.
[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:18.260]   I don't know how to respond to that
[02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:19.480]   other than just be grateful
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:22.860]   that people can say stuff like that to us.
[02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:24.340]   So the fireside thing is kind of cool.
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:26.800]   We're still experimenting with it.
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:29.340]   It's an interactive podcast, group coaching.
[02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:31.060]   It's fun.
[02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:32.940]   - Great.
[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:35.020]   I mean, I would say you're changing lives there.
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:37.200]   I mean, the saving of marriage is no small deal.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:38.340]   And I think that the ability
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:42.180]   to communicate directly with people also,
[02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:43.820]   I imagine gives them the opportunity
[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:47.820]   to implement the tools that you're providing in real time.
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:50.460]   It's one thing to hear about something and try it,
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:52.480]   but then you can get feedback in real time.
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:55.540]   Are you on these fireside chats directly
[02:43:55.540 --> 02:43:56.880]   or members of your team?
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.340]   - No, we do one every week and I'm once a month.
[02:44:00.340 --> 02:44:02.320]   And the other thing too,
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:04.940]   like I can explain something one way.
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:08.580]   And if for whatever reason it doesn't land in your context,
[02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:09.840]   you can't quite get it.
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:13.680]   So that's what we found about the interactive nature of it.
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:16.680]   Somebody comes on and asks a question in their context
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:18.220]   and then I'll answer it and they'll go like,
[02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:20.320]   oh, oh, oh, okay.
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:21.780]   All right, that helped.
[02:44:21.780 --> 02:44:24.500]   So you get to hear people like you
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:26.540]   who are struggling with it the way you are,
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:29.820]   but I haven't put it in your context yet.
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:32.420]   And that's the other thing that's great about a Q&A,
[02:44:32.420 --> 02:44:34.060]   a live Q&A.
[02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:36.500]   - We had a guest on here who told me
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:40.580]   that there are amazing data supporting the fact
[02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:43.820]   that people follow the medical and health advice
[02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:47.380]   of doctors that they can relate to far more
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:49.860]   than they follow the medical and health advice
[02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:53.080]   of physicians that they feel aren't like them.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:57.760]   And oftentimes this can include the physician
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:59.520]   or healthcare provider being someone
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:01.300]   that they would aspire to be like,
[02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:03.400]   but oftentimes it's just some common rapport.
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:05.120]   Like they both like baseball
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:07.320]   or they both like to cook or to garden.
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.880]   And that sets a bridge where then the patient
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:11.560]   is willing to do all these things
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:13.720]   that ordinarily they would be resistant to.
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:16.280]   And there are really good data to support this.
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:18.840]   And that really stuck with me
[02:45:18.840 --> 02:45:21.160]   'cause it says that it's not just about the information
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:23.960]   or the delivery route or the information
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:26.400]   that the context and that rapport is,
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.060]   even along something as like,
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:29.940]   oh, you're a, by the way,
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:33.200]   I'm not a major sports fan on most things,
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.400]   but like, oh, you're a Bills fan or something like me too.
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:36.760]   Like that can be the difference
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.580]   between somebody doing all the things
[02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:41.180]   to lower their blood pressure, the day in,
[02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:43.800]   changing their diet, all those things
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:46.760]   versus not making the changes at all.
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:48.200]   - Rapport is a magic, yeah,
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:51.580]   it's kind of a magic component that changes,
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:52.540]   changes everything.
[02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:54.520]   - Well, fireside sounds like a great opportunity
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:56.200]   for people to not just ask questions,
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:59.040]   but to build rapport with you and members of your team.
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:01.360]   So I'm going to check it out.
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:04.760]   Lord knows I need help improving my communications
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:07.280]   in certain domains of life.
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:09.360]   Believe me, I get the memos.
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:16.480]   Fact, what other writing projects are you involved in?
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:18.560]   If any.
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.560]   - We've been toying with this companion operations manual
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:31.360]   for tactical empathy, which getting it right is important.
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:34.660]   So it's sort of a companion book
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:36.360]   to never split the difference.
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:38.380]   That's probably at least a year and a half out
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:39.220]   from being done.
[02:46:39.220 --> 02:46:41.280]   So in the meantime, we just do,
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:42.900]   we do a lot of online training.
[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:45.760]   You know, we got a newsletter we put out weekly
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:50.960]   for people to get our latest cutting edge application
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:52.260]   thoughts as much as possible.
[02:46:52.260 --> 02:46:55.440]   We're putting information out that we charge for a lot
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:57.820]   and we put out a lot of free stuff.
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:01.500]   You know, I'm throwing out ideas on Instagram,
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:04.120]   but we're constantly trying to put information out there
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:07.680]   so that people can collaborate better.
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:09.460]   So specifically, we just finished a book
[02:47:09.460 --> 02:47:11.920]   for residential real estate agents,
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:13.960]   a friend of mine, Steve Shoal,
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:16.240]   we put that out last November.
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:18.200]   That's sort of niched,
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:20.860]   but it's mostly the Black Swan method for real estate agents
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:22.880]   'cause every conversation they're in
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:25.400]   is a difficult emotional conversation.
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:27.940]   Sell of a house is one of the most stressful moments
[02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:31.000]   of anybody's life, selling or buying.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.160]   So we just put that out.
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:34.440]   In the meantime, you know,
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:38.160]   we're spreading the gospel as much as possible.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:40.520]   - Well, we'll certainly point out the various places
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:43.200]   people can find you and the different venues
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:44.680]   for learning more.
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:48.960]   I want to say that numerous times
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:50.680]   throughout today's conversation,
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:54.200]   you threw out the words sounds like as an opener.
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:55.320]   And I have to say,
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:57.860]   I have this kind of crazy idea in the back of my mind.
[02:47:57.860 --> 02:48:02.860]   You know, I believe that simple field tested tools
[02:48:02.860 --> 02:48:06.220]   are immensely powerful,
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:08.060]   not just for resolving the negotiations,
[02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:10.040]   but really for changing the way that people interact
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.180]   with each other and themselves.
[02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:15.520]   And, you know, if I have one wish for the world
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:17.780]   on the basis of our conversation,
[02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:20.840]   how amazing would it be if kids learned early on
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:26.340]   to talk to one another from that sounds like perspective?
[02:48:26.340 --> 02:48:29.220]   Because I think that would naturally orient them
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:33.700]   toward listening or at least offering a hypothesis
[02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:37.060]   of what they heard and how poorly they might be listening
[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:40.060]   and then getting a defensive stance response
[02:48:40.060 --> 02:48:45.060]   that informs them about the accuracy or lack of accuracy
[02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:46.160]   and on and on.
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:49.620]   I feel like the sounds like question,
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:53.240]   sounds like you feel blank or sounds like you believe blank
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:58.240]   just seems to me like one of the most potent tools
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:00.740]   in the universe.
[02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:03.860]   And I sure wish that all adults would implement it,
[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:06.540]   but that kids would learn about it too.
[02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:08.800]   - Yeah, that's a great thought.
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:11.900]   You know, how do we teach them at a younger age
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:14.940]   that listening is actually an effective thing to do?
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:18.780]   It's actually a way to think things through also.
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:19.940]   So yeah, I agree.
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:22.820]   I mean, we have a magic wand, right?
[02:49:22.820 --> 02:49:25.380]   - Exactly.
[02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:29.420]   Well, Chris, I wanna thank you so much for your time today.
[02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:31.860]   I mean, you've joined us on this tour
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:35.100]   of so many different facets of your work prior and present,
[02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:37.120]   and you let us get a little glimpse
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:39.640]   into the portal of your future work too,
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:41.220]   which I'm eagerly awaiting.
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:44.040]   I also just wanna thank you for everything that you do.
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:48.300]   You've always struck me as such a giver of knowledge.
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:51.960]   And you know, you can't put a value on that.
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:54.220]   You're constantly putting knowledge into the world
[02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:59.220]   on Instagram, your book, fireside and courses
[02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:02.640]   and on and on gleaned from your experience
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:05.060]   in very, very intense circumstances,
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:06.720]   but really with an eye toward people
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:09.420]   getting the most out of that for their daily lives,
[02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:12.260]   which hopefully don't involve hostage negotiations,
[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:14.960]   unless they're a hostage negotiator.
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:18.740]   So I just wanna say thank you ever so much for what you do
[02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:21.940]   and for being such a phenomenal communicator.
[02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:24.100]   And also thank you for doing into that
[02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:26.440]   late night FM DJ voice.
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:28.740]   [Chris laughing]
[02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:30.220]   - Yeah, you know, I've been,
[02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:33.300]   I wanted to be here sitting with you,
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:35.620]   being interviewed on your podcast
[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:37.820]   since I first discovered it, you.
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:38.660]   - Thank you.
[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:40.260]   - Several years ago, and it's a privilege to be here.
[02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:43.780]   I really, really, and I love what you're doing
[02:50:43.780 --> 02:50:47.820]   in getting actionable, usable tools into the world
[02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:50.680]   so people can navigate more effectively.
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:52.060]   - Thank you, right back at you.
[02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:52.900]   Come back again.
[02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:54.500]   - All right, thanks.
[02:50:54.500 --> 02:50:56.360]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:50:56.360 --> 02:50:57.680]   with Chris Voss.

[02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:33.300]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:35.160]   I do read all the comments.
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:37.240]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:39.320]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:41.940]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:51:41.940 --> 02:51:44.440]   Not on today's episode, but on many previous episodes
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:47.320]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:49.400]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:51.560]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:53.960]   for things like improving sleep, for hormone support,
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:55.200]   and for focus.
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:56.720]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:57.780]   with Momentous Supplements,
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:59.480]   and we did that for several reasons.
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:00.820]   First of all, their ingredients
[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:02.600]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:04.520]   Second of all, they tend to focus
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.440]   on single ingredient formulations,
[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:08.840]   which make it easy to develop the most cost-effective
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:11.980]   and biologically effective supplement regimen for you.
[02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:14.580]   And third, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,
[02:52:14.580 --> 02:52:17.500]   which we realize is important because many of you reside
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:19.320]   outside of the United States.
[02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:21.840]   To see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:24.280]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:27.340]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:29.400]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:31.640]   you can do so by going to Huberman Lab
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:33.360]   on all social media platforms.
[02:52:33.360 --> 02:52:36.200]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:38.840]   LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:40.020]   On all of those platforms,
[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:41.840]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:43.400]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:44.740]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:52:44.740 --> 02:52:46.900]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:48.440]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:51.920]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:53.080]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:54.280]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:56.660]   the neural network newsletter is a zero-cost monthly
[02:52:56.660 --> 02:52:58.920]   newsletter that includes podcast summaries,
[02:52:58.920 --> 02:53:01.640]   as well as toolkits, so toolkits for sleep,
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:03.240]   toolkits for learning and plasticity,
[02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:06.640]   toolkits related to dopamine regulation, and much more.
[02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:07.840]   Again, it's all zero cost.
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:09.880]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:12.360]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:13.880]   and simply enter your email,
[02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:16.400]   and we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:18.640]   Thank you once again for joining for today's discussion
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:19.720]   with Chris Voss.
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:22.000]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:26.380]   [upbeat music]
[02:53:26.380 --> 02:53:28.960]   (upbeat music)
