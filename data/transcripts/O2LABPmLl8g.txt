[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.720]   All right, brethren, I'll just allow for one more minute for those coming in to settle
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   down.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.640]   The way I intend to proceed as we go through this breakout session, which is really a learning
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:43.160]   from the history of the church in Africa, will be that I'll probably try to speak for
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:53.280]   about 30 to 45 minutes, but I really would like to get some questions from you, because
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:04.520]   I'll be trying to cram about 2,000 years into roughly 30 to 40 minutes.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.680]   That's an impossible task.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:17.360]   But really, as we learn from that piece of history, we will be as individuals having
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   some thoughts that we may need clarity on, and therefore I would like that to be the
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.840]   opportunity for you to ask.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.080]   I'm not sure whether they'll bring the microphone to you or whether you'll be able to speak
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.920]   loud enough for us to hear, and then I will answer.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:51.080]   So that's the way that I'd like us to proceed, so that we may learn, because history is God's
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   story.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:04.620]   is what God has been doing in history, and He's a principled God, and therefore
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.480]   we can learn from Him.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.080]   Well, let's pray then as we commence.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.960]   Eternal and gracious God in heaven, thank you for this opportunity for us to learn together
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:33.360]   from history, from your story, especially around the continent of Africa.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.400]   We pray that as we think about the work of missions, that we may especially learn from
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:52.520]   the missionary activities of the past, so that we may be enabled to do your work in
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.760]   an even better way as we draw near to the second coming of your Son.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.920]   Be with us now we ask in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:15.400]   Yeah, so now when we begin to consider God's work in the continent of Africa, we really
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:26.380]   need to realize that unlike America, we are dealing with a continent that is integrated
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.480]   to some extent with the history that is there in the Bible.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   An obvious example is Egypt, where I was last week.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.920]   You know that the people of God collectively, Israel, would have spent time in Egypt.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.000]   But also our own Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, you will recall that from His birth, His parents
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.160]   hid Him in Africa for a season, and then when Herod, who was seeking to take His life, died,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.840]   He was able then to go back into the promised land.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.920]   But even as you get into the book of Acts, again you will notice individuals like the
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:29.320]   Utopian eunuch who ended up going back into Ethiopia, and it is believed that quite a
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.920]   part of the Christian church in that part of the world comes from there.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.800]   So there's a lot to be said for especially North Africa and its involvement with the
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.440]   New Testament church.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.480]   One or two individuals that are mentioned even in the book of Acts, once you hear the
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:03.160]   word "Niger," you already know that it is related again to our part of the world.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:12.240]   It is said of Apollos, a native of Alexandria, and as you know, Apollos again was an individual
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:23.920]   that was quite eloquent and played his role, not only in Ephesus but also in Corinth as
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   well.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:35.720]   So really, by the time the biblical literature is coming to a close, there is some way in
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:45.040]   which the continent of Africa is beginning to have a spillover of the Christian faith
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.840]   that was taking place in what we would refer to as the Middle East.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:05.640]   Part of what caused this was really the persecution that was taking place in the Jewish area,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.360]   and Christians were having to escape for their lives.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.880]   Some would have gone in the direction where we have India and Asia in that sense.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.840]   Others would have been making their way further into Europe, and some would have been making
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   their way further south.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.740]   But it wasn't long before Alexandria, and those of you who have studied church history
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:49.200]   will attest to this, in the Nile Delta pouring into the Mediterranean Sea, you have a city
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:59.640]   there called Alexandria that became by and large the center of Christianity in terms
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:12.140]   of dealing with quite a number of the major doctrinal clarity that has since come to be
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.160]   appreciated by the church universal.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.600]   So you have names like Origen, you've got names like Clement of Alexandria, you've got
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.360]   names like Athanasius, and so on.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.080]   Names that all of you here, if you've ever bothered to be in the church context, rather
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.960]   in a Bible college context, would have studied.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   So I can go on quite a bit because there are a number of names that keep coming up.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.960]   So the Trinitarian controversy, for instance, is one that would have been settled there.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:05.760]   The anthropological controversy in terms of the capacities that are there with respect
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.880]   to sin and salvation in us would have also been settled there.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:22.180]   So the church universal in that sense owes a lot to that part of the world.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:29.840]   In fact, as I said last week, I was preaching at a conference in Alexandria, and I remember
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:39.680]   saying to the 500 or so individuals who were listening that they just don't know how privileged
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:50.100]   they are to live in Alexandria because of the richness of that history.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:09:00.960]   On one hand, if one was to say what do I learn from that context, it's the place of theological
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:11.980]   training and theological clarity in the health of the Christian church.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:20.320]   The school that was established in Alexandria helped to provide that foundation.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:31.980]   And therefore, we as churches need to be deliberate in ensuring that we are supporting educational
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:42.820]   institutions that are credible as far as theology is concerned, because on that foundation we
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.620]   build the future of the Christian faith.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:54.820]   So when you think in terms of TMU, you think in terms of the Master's Seminary here, when
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:03.700]   you think in terms of TMAI, the Master's Academy International, and a number of you are coming
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:09.700]   from backgrounds where you are running seminaries, Bible colleges, perhaps even attached to your
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.500]   church, don't look down upon that.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.620]   It's an all-important point.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:32.860]   However, it's not long before in the 6th century that Islam came in from Saudi Arabia, flowed
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:42.900]   into Egypt itself, and cleared the Christian witness and the Christian churches in North
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.900]   Africa.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.820]   I don't need to go into details about how that happened.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:55.500]   I want to keep concentrating on what we learn from what happened.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:04.360]   And basically, the reason why -- we may argue about it -- but the reason why the Christian
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:18.260]   faith suffered the way it did at the hands of the Arabs that came in the name of Islam,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.620]   it is said that there would have been at least two or three causes.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:30.540]   One of them was the fact that the church was largely disunited because of the doctrinal
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.940]   controversies that were taking place.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.440]   And so instead of thinking in terms of what we have in common, the church was largely
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.460]   thinking in terms of what we don't have in common and concentrating on that.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:54.460]   And therefore, when Islam came sweeping through, instead of working together, the Christian
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.820]   church was largely fragmented.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:09.100]   The second is the fact that there were a number of what you'd call local tribes in North Africa
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.100]   that would have made up quite a bit of the majority.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:20.720]   But because they were of the poorer section of society, like one of them is called the
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:27.940]   Babas, they were not reached out in terms of bringing the Christian faith to their level
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:38.100]   so that they would internalize it and the very culture would be developed along biblical
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.860]   lines.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:51.660]   And so it's like the Christian faith was largely for an elite section of society and therefore
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:13:04.460]   when these warriors of Islam came through, North Africa was not ready to resist.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:10.460]   Now, of course, they also came with negotiations.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:19.140]   So if you don't fight back, you will be allowed to still remain as you please.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:28.700]   But in the process, they were still overtaken by an Islamic culture.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:37.300]   So generally speaking, that is what is said, so the Coptic church in North Africa was not
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.620]   able to withstand the attacks that were coming.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:54.220]   And it is said that by the year 1050, the bishops of the Christian church went right
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.180]   down from about 30 to 40 to about 6 bishops.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:07.220]   And by the year 1300, we were down to actually just one bishop of the Christian church in
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.460]   North Africa.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.420]   Again, just a basic lesson.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:20.020]   I think as churches, we do need to be clear about what we believe.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.140]   So there is nothing wrong with that.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:29.940]   We need to teach our people why we are Presbyterians or why we are Baptists or why we are Reformed.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.260]   We need to teach them.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:40.140]   But I think we need to also learn to draw the line in terms of we are brethren in the
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.700]   Lord where the Bible draws the line.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:54.660]   I've written a small book, it should be in the bookshops there, it's under Crossway,
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:02.380]   and it's entitled "Unity" and it's "Striving Together for the Gospel."
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:08.660]   And I tried to argue in that book exactly what I'm saying here, that it's true we
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:15.660]   ought to have a clear doctrinal position because we are a church, we are churches.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.340]   But at the same time, there are areas where we can work together.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.580]   For instance, book publishing is a typical example.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.740]   The Bible being published in various languages and so on, again, it's something that we
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.860]   can fairly easily do together.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:41.340]   And some conferences can again bring Christians together in a wider area because when the
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:47.540]   world attacks, it rarely simply attacks one denomination.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:54.460]   As far as I'm concerned, Christians, and if we are fragmented, we are weak at that level.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.800]   So we need to be clear on that score.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:07.020]   And then the second, again a lesson being learned from church history, is that the Christian
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:17.100]   faith, we must learn to break the boundaries, the social demographic boundaries around us
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:27.420]   to ensure that the gospel crosses into even the inner cities or the poorer sections of
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.180]   our wider society.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:43.980]   In Africa, for instance, what you call here the prosperity gospel, it's metamorphosized
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.100]   into something that's beyond that in Africa.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:56.860]   But it's in the poorer parts of our cities, the congested areas of our cities.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:03.980]   And it's easy for us Reformed people, because Reformed you tend to be sort of professionals
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:12.500]   going upwards, it's easy for us to have a lot of light, doctrinal light among ourselves,
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:23.120]   and then when you cross into these densely populated areas, there's darkness there.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:30.300]   And we need to realize that that's where trouble comes from.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:36.700]   And therefore, we need to ensure that the Christian faith is reaching those areas, transforming
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:43.780]   people in those areas, so that biblical Christianity is also there.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:54.140]   Otherwise, it remains an elitist club, and when political upheavals begin, we are completely
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:02.980]   powerless because normally those end up with the crowds, and the crowds don't have biblical
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.980]   Christianity.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:10.980]   Okay, so that's the second aspect that we learn from this attack of Islam.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:19.740]   Now, if I had a map of Africa here, so I need to imagine that I am on your side of the map,
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.740]   okay?
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:30.500]   So, West Africa is somewhere here, Egypt and Ethiopia are somewhere here, and then somewhere
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.620]   at the bottom here is where we have Zambia and South Africa and so on, okay?
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.020]   So the L-shape is a little bit like that.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.900]   So if you can imagine, what happened was that Christianity was wiped out at the top.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.660]   Well, they were still there, but completely weak.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:55.220]   The Muslims, as they made their way into Spain, that's where they were stopped in their major
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.620]   campaign.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:05.800]   There was another movement that brought the Christian faith back into Africa, but this
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:12.740]   time it is well after the Reformation and -- well, around the Reformation era, by the
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   way.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.880]   So it's around the 16th century that new efforts began.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.780]   And again, we've got some lessons there, so that's why I want us to quickly rush there.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:38.860]   And it was the fact that Europe was looking for materials, foodstuffs and so on that would
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:46.220]   be used for economic purposes, and they were looking for that from Asia.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:54.820]   Previously, they would make their way through the Mediterranean, through the Red Sea, and
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:02.060]   then make their way to India, for instance, to get their merchandise, their commodities.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.740]   But now that place was taken over by Islam, so it was completely dangerous.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:13.940]   And so they began to look for ways to -- so here we have the map I was talking about.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.580]   So you have Portugal and Spain on this side.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:24.620]   So they began to look for ways to get to India, and the way to do it is to come down West
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:34.220]   Africa, come all the way to the Cape, at that time of good hope, and then make your way
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.420]   up until you get to India.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:45.780]   So individuals like Vasco da Gama and others began to, on behalf of the Portuguese king,
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:57.860]   began to make efforts to survey those opportunities to go and get to India and other places in
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.820]   Asia, sell commodities, get others, bring them back, and so on.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:10.820]   So what motivated the discovery of that route was not Christianity at that point.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.860]   It's human greed.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:24.340]   However, these ships also took with them chaplains and missionaries.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:33.900]   As they were making their way around Africa, they would have places where they would stop
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:44.940]   to have meals, to rest, to offload some items and get others on and so forth, and in those
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.220]   places they began to establish mission stations.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:59.340]   And normally these were chaplains that would be ministering to their own people in those
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.540]   areas.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.380]   There were two slight weaknesses with that.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:11.620]   One was it wasn't really missions, because missions is supposed to be you going to the
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.140]   people that live there in order to reach them with the gospel.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:23.860]   You're not going there to your own people and then try to minister to them.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.900]   That was the first weakness.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:34.380]   The second is that this was almost exclusively Roman Catholic missionaries and chaplains.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.780]   You know Spain, and you know Portugal.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:46.420]   It was almost exclusively Roman Catholic, and it proved to have been a complete disaster,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.420]   a complete disaster.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:23:02.040]   The first reason is that they didn't have the gospel.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.500]   It was a religion of works.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:15.220]   So inevitably the religion of works does not change a person from inside out.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:24.820]   So it gives people a form of religion, but it does not kill the "me" to establish Christ
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.860]   at the center of one's life.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.140]   So it proved a complete failure for that reason.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:42.140]   Another reason is that there was already something of the slave trade that was beginning to happen,
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:50.660]   and there was a lot of suspicion of people with a light skin.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:58.180]   And so a number of these missionaries, or chaplains, a mixture of the two, number one
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:08.620]   were suspected by the local people to be part of these who are coming in in order to grab
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.200]   land and grab our people.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:20.380]   And number two, a number of them were wrongly accused and therefore murdered.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:28.700]   So you had quite a number of mission posts that would start and then they would be completely
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.220]   raided, and that would be the end.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:41.260]   All the way, remember the map, around West Africa, all the way down to the Cape, East
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:48.400]   Africa as you are making your way to India.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.720]   Just one or two comments about that.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.960]   Remember we are trying to learn lessons.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:01.280]   The first from that period is quite simple, and it's this, that there's no missions without
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.600]   the gospel.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:13.440]   You can, in a sense, establish some kind of Christianity by providing health facilities
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:21.400]   and educational facilities, by providing clothing and food and so forth.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.940]   You will get people together.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:32.280]   But without the true gospel, you are simply preparing yourself for disappointment.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.340]   It's a matter of time.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.860]   So that's number one.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:46.460]   Number two is that we need to be clear in our minds as we are engaged in missions, who
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   are we being associated with?
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.300]   Who are we being associated with?
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:05.020]   As we shall go on to see when we come to what is called the scramble for Africa, one of
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:14.460]   the difficulties that the Christian church had in missions was this fear of the people
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:22.220]   that these are linked with these, and therefore we don't want them.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:28.100]   Well, in actual fact, they were bringing the gospel.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.460]   There's a saying in Africa, maybe I'm going ahead of myself here, there's a saying in
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:41.620]   Africa that the missionary came with the Bible in one hand and a gun in the other.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:55.100]   It's a very famous saying, and they say that we had the land, they had the Bible.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.660]   We closed our eyes because they said let's pray.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:06.740]   And when we opened, we had the Bible, they had the land.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:18.220]   Now obviously it's not true, but you can see it's this association that had its own serious
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.980]   implications.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:36.500]   And I think there are times when riding on the back of secular, non-Christian institutions
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:45.340]   can apparently make our work lighter, apparently.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:53.980]   But before long we can easily discover that in fact it has become our loss because of
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.820]   associations.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.700]   So I will sort of jump into that in a moment.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:13.860]   But somewhere in the 1800, rather 18th century, there was born what we call today the great
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.100]   missionary movement.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.660]   You remember William Carey, he didn't come to Africa, he went to India.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:27.380]   But it was round about that time that there was a huge movement among Protestants now,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:36.180]   among Protestants, that began to also go into the same world where Roman Catholic missions
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.540]   had failed.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:46.260]   The difference is that they came in with the true gospel.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:59.620]   And as they came in with the true gospel, a lot of them were missionary societies that
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.340]   involved different denominations working together.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:11.300]   But working together in order to see the churches established.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.960]   So again, we've got our map.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:20.740]   So the first area that really got covered was West Africa, just at the bottom there.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:27.180]   You know, you have Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Togo, and other countries there.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:35.580]   So that's where you initially had a number of mission stations starting.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.860]   And then you had the West Africa where you have the Congo, you've got Angola, and so
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.860]   on.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:50.940]   Again there, along the shore, the coastal region, again you began having different mission
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:55.380]   stations being established.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:01.140]   And then you had South Africa itself as well with the British and Dutch missionaries.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:09.580]   And then as you begin to go up Mozambique, and so on, Tanzania, and Kenya, and so forth,
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:18.420]   you had other mission agencies that were establishing mission stations.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.420]   The greatest challenge that was there then was the slave trade.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:37.980]   Because what it did is it made the people to fail to be established in one place.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:46.140]   One of my favorite missionaries is David Livingstone, and I've read his biography a few times and
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.940]   even taught on it.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.260]   And one of his greatest frustrations when he left the Cape, there was Robert Moffat
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:31:00.600]   there, he married Robert's daughter, and they made their way.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.100]   He wanted to bring the Gospel into the interior of Africa.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:11.420]   And he found that he would settle in one place, begin to minister to the people there, and
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:16.020]   then in the middle of the night the place would be raided, the following day there's
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.600]   nobody.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.220]   The people have been taken.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:28.340]   Or, sometimes it's not even being raided, it's just rumor does its rounds that we will
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.060]   be raided, and then the people would disappear.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.340]   It really frustrated him.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:47.100]   And hence one of the things that David Livingstone did was to go back to Britain and he was pleading
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:54.140]   with Christians there to come into Africa.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.740]   But he didn't just want them to come as missionaries, in other words to bring Christianity.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:06.500]   He also wanted them to bring commerce into Africa.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:14.100]   Because he felt that if commerce came in, then the governments that are benefiting from
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:20.540]   that commerce would deliberately also want to come in and protect those areas.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:26.660]   And so they used to be called protectorates.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:37.160]   And once they do so, then the social lives of the people would stabilize.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:43.480]   So he would speak in terms of commerce and Christianity, commerce and Christianity, because
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:53.920]   of the fact that he realized that that was what was going to help bring about the social
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   stability.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:04.960]   Well, it began to happen, and the result of that is what was called the scramble for Africa.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:13.440]   Because Britain, Germany, Spain, Portugal, I mean all these countries, just Belgium,
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.920]   they just rushed in.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:23.840]   And on one hand, it helped to stabilize, because now people just couldn't come through as bandits
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.160]   with guns and ship slaves away.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.480]   The places were now protected.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:40.840]   The people that were there were now getting into employment at a very basic level and
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   getting more and more established.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.640]   Roads were being developed, railway lines were being developed, postal systems were
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.780]   being developed, schools and hospitals were being developed, and so on.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:59.300]   Not really necessarily for the benefit of the people that they found there, but it was
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:06.020]   necessary even for their own people that would be living in those places.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:16.420]   So that was a huge period that took place from about 1878 to the year 1900.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:22.580]   Now inevitably, it had positive and negative effects on missions, and then I want to just
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.980]   quickly comment on that.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:37.180]   One was that it became easier to do missions work, because you now had roads, you had railway
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:46.580]   lines, you had postal systems, you could ask for supplies from Europe, and the supplies
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.420]   would arrive through the supply chain.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:56.900]   It's bringing other things, and it would also bring your Bibles, your medical equipment,
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.900]   and so on and so forth.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.740]   So it made missions easier.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:11.220]   The downside to it was the fact that, for instance, in the areas that were under Portuguese
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:17.760]   and Spanish control, for instance, Protestants were not welcome there.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:26.580]   Because each country that had its area ensured that its state religion is the one that was
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.620]   being encouraged.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:35.660]   And so even now, when you go into various parts of Africa, you can't miss the fact that
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:45.060]   you can see the development that took place is parallel with the kind of church that was
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.200]   established there through missions agencies.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:59.240]   So on one hand, it meant that those areas that were Protestant were jealously guarded
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:09.080]   by the state that was over the place, and therefore the Christian church would grow
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.420]   and multiply under that particular banner.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:21.400]   So there were positives and negatives, simply because the Christian church is in a new world.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.540]   Those of you who've done church history will appreciate that we often say that God in His
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:36.080]   wisdom brought the Christian faith to its fruition under the Roman Empire, because the
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:44.560]   Roman Empire provided the network, provided the language, provided so much that then the
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.720]   Christian church just roared on top of it.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.800]   The Apostle Paul and others benefited from that.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.360]   Well, that's exactly what was happening in Africa as well.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.000]   So there were positives and there were negatives.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.880]   Another positive was that whereas previously the world wasn't interested when missionaries
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:18.680]   were dying like flies, they're not interested, but now that they were coming in to get the
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:28.280]   wealth in order to ship it to their countries, well when their own non-Christian employees
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:36.680]   were dying like flies, well they began to seriously try and find the answer to this
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.560]   fever that was killing their people.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:47.920]   In due season it was found that it is malaria, it was found that it was caused by a mosquito,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:57.520]   a particular kind of mosquito, and in the process they found the medicine for it and
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:04.960]   that helped missionaries to live longer on the continent.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   So there were some benefits that were coming out of the scientific revolution.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.200]   I think the lessons from there must be pretty obvious.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:25.440]   We cannot completely divorce ourselves from the world, from what's happening in the political
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.940]   economic sphere.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.760]   We can benefit from it.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   I mean think of the internet.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.840]   I don't think the guys behind the internet who were thinking about spreading the gospel
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.480]   were there.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.840]   Maybe.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.160]   But I doubt it.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:54.280]   But look at the impact it has had in the world, and I'm speaking about Africa.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:06.520]   Prior to the world of the internet, Africa was largely swept over by the prosperity gospel
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.240]   through cable TV.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.400]   We didn't have the money, those of us who were reformed, we didn't have the money to
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.680]   compete.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.600]   So it was junk that was being piped across the continent.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:40.680]   Well, 10, 20 years ago, people began to download the MacArthur, Piper, Paw Washer, Samoans,
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:50.000]   and it's young people doing so through their cell phones, and the situation on the ground
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.040]   has changed.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.960]   It's amazing.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:07.640]   So there are these benefits that come from developmental scientific changes that are
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:19.960]   happening in the world where we are not wrong to connect with that and begin to benefit
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.040]   from that.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:29.200]   So that's definitely one area that we need to be innovative.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:37.240]   So sometimes I go to places where I find people have a very negative view of David Livingstone.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:43.480]   They say, "Ah, he wasn't a missionary, he was just an explorer," they say.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:51.880]   Well, let me tell you something, Zambia, which is the country I come from, became independent
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:41:03.000]   in 1964, and at that time all its major cities were named after individuals in Britain or
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.480]   cities in Britain.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:17.400]   In 1964, the first indigenous Zambian government changed all those names to African names except
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:27.800]   one, just one, and that was 61 years ago when they decided this one we won't change to an
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.240]   African name, and it is the city called Livingstone.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:40.520]   It's the only city in the whole country of Zambia with a foreign name.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:51.680]   And this is now 60 years later, nobody ever says, "What are we still doing with this explorer?"
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:58.440]   The reason is because they appreciate what this person did when he opened up Central
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.680]   Africa to commerce and Christianity.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.940]   It stabilised our lives.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:13.440]   It helped us to live with one another as well because we recognised we are all made in the
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.000]   image of God.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.080]   He's not the one who was preaching to us, but he brought in the missionaries and we
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   are beneficiaries.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:30.680]   Now I need to rush on to just one extra point and then I need to allow for at least 10,
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.200]   15 minutes in case you've got some questions.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:42.320]   We fast forward to the more recent past.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   When the foreign missionaries began to work all over Africa, one of the things that they
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:57.640]   were jealous about, or careful about, was to separate African traditional religions
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.760]   from Christianity.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:08.160]   So anything that smelled like African traditional religions, they kept out.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.880]   Even just the drums that were being beaten were kept out.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:19.780]   In fact, there's somebody who drew a picture which was obviously a cartoon and it was of
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.400]   a missionary.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.920]   He drew the map of Africa as if it's on the ground.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:31.660]   And so it was a missionary dragging a piano from the coast and sort of taking it into
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:37.400]   Africa in order to kick out the African drum.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.520]   Obviously it's comical.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.640]   But to some extent, there was a loss and a gain.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:57.560]   The gain was that it helped the African church or converts to clarify in their minds that
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.820]   this is something new.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:10.660]   So there was being willing to throw away the baby with the bathwater so that we don't make
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.420]   this mistake.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:23.060]   And therefore when the initial prophets on African soil were coming up, they were rejected
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:28.300]   and they were, listen to me, excommunicated.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:33.700]   And so they began their own cults, and there were quite a number across Africa, I could
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.580]   give you their names.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:46.780]   But the evangelical church was protected for at least 50 years, maybe even 100 years.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:53.580]   But in the second part of the last century, so that's 1950 going onwards, because of the
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:45:02.980]   Pentecostal movement that had begun on this side, inside the evangelical world, well,
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:08.540]   the door got opened for prophets in the churches.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:20.000]   In evangelical circles, and a floodgate has since opened, a major floodgate that has made
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.060]   it extremely difficult for the evangelical church – now I know in America that phrase
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:33.900]   can be anything, but I'm speaking in terms of gospel-centered churches – to be able
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:43.060]   to say that that undermines the sufficiency of Scripture.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:53.820]   So if I was to speak in terms of a recent lesson that we need to learn, it is the wisdom
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:02.700]   of the pioneer Christian missionaries that came into that part of the world to protect
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:10.860]   Protestantism from being swallowed by African traditional religions.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:21.720]   At the moment, one of the most popular views of a pastor is that he's a man of God.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.700]   Now that's supposed to be innocent, isn't it?
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:28.660]   But the man of God, meaning he's the guy who is the equivalent to the village witch
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:41.900]   doctor, he exudes with strange powers so that he takes away all your problems, basically.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.340]   If you're failing to get married, go to him, he'll do dabra kadabra and you'll get married.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:52.340]   If your business is failing, go to him, he'll do the same dabra kadabra and your business
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.340]   will pick up.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.140]   Just the same way in which you go to the witch doctor and he moves a few bones around and
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.740]   supposedly fixes your problems.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:11.900]   So it's an area that today we desperately need to be biblical about.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.100]   So let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:23.700]   It's not enough if someone tells you that I've established 200 churches in my part of
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.700]   Africa.
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.900]   People go, "Wow!"
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:34.180]   Find out what is it that is believed there.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:41.580]   What is it that's being taught?
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:52.420]   And sadly, if you were to go and listen to what's going on there, there's very little
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:58.780]   resemblance to the Christianity of the Bible.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:06.580]   It's African traditional religion sprinkled with a little bit of Christianity.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.820]   That's not missions.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.060]   That's not missions.
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:19.740]   And especially the fact that as I'm speaking right now, there is a growth of the Christian
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.660]   faith on African soil.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:31.060]   The numbers are staggering, by the way, and that Christian faith is now being exported
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.900]   back to the Western world.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:40.380]   Sadly, we are exporting what is even more dangerous than what you exported to us in
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.700]   the recent past.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:51.580]   And there's need for those of us who are of a Reformed conviction, not only to be shocked
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:56.900]   about this, but to say to ourselves, "Let's get into action.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.100]   Let's do something about this.
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:07.540]   Let's help establish sound churches where the Spirit of God is clearly working.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:15.740]   Let's establish training for pastors so that they are really grounded as the converts are
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   multiplying."
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:24.620]   I mean literally, the Christian church is galloping while we are still tying our shoelaces.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:33.340]   Let's do our part so that we have a healthier Christianity coming from Africa in the near
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.340]   future.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:41.060]   Well, brethren, there are ten more minutes, and I would hate to make you lose those ten
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:47.180]   minutes with me just continuing to rumble along.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:52.020]   If there's an area some of you are already ministering in various parts of Africa, you
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.980]   may want to ask a question or two.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.020]   I'd like to answer those questions.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:01.140]   There may be no microphone, but we are men.
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.860]   There is -- oh, there we are.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.260]   So anybody, just walk or he gets to you or whatever.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.060]   Ah, there we are.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.060]   Question.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.740]   Can you hear me?
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.740]   Yes.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:22.780]   Zambia is a Christian nation in its Declaration of Independence similar to -- the Declaration
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.300]   of Independence is similar to ours.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:32.540]   How do you find that nation being called Christian?
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:38.900]   Is it as unhealthy as the rest of the nations in Africa, or is it more healthy?
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.220]   All right.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:46.860]   So the way Zambia ended up with the phrase, "Zambia is a Christian nation in its Constitution,"
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.140]   was largely a reaction.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:51:04.340]   So what happened was towards the end of the 1980s, Eastern sort of Asian religions like
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:11.500]   Buddhism and Hinduism and so on, quite apart from Islam, were beginning to find inroads
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:16.860]   into Zambia, and it was largely through the political structures.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.820]   You know, these religions, especially Islam, tends to be quite political.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:31.380]   So when the new government came in in 1991, there was already -- well, part of the reason
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:38.140]   why the previous president lost was because people were already beginning to see these
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:42.100]   inroads and it was making them very uncomfortable.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:50.940]   So part of the campaign by the opposition was the fact that when we come into power,
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:56.580]   we'll make sure that these guys are kicked back where they belong.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:02.220]   And so as soon as that new president came in, who was Frederick Chiluva, he made the
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:10.580]   declaration literally within a month of him becoming president, and then parliament enacted
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:14.020]   in terms of putting it into our Constitution.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.820]   So it was largely a reaction.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:21.820]   And so a number of years later when he would be asked, "What do you really mean by this?"
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:27.980]   it was clear that he didn't quite know what to say except the fact that, "I'm just saying
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:32.660]   that 85% of Zambians claim to be Christian."
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:37.040]   That's the way he began to justify it.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:42.300]   It has not changed anything in terms of the number of people getting converted, the number
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:51.060]   of churches being established, because Zambia already is a very open country to the Christian
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.980]   faith.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:53:01.020]   The best schools in Zambia are run by churches by far; 60% of our health facilities are run
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.520]   by churches.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.500]   The government recognizes that.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:13.020]   And so there is a lot of goodwill in the Zambian context, I would say.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:19.740]   So it's there in our Constitution, but it doesn't make anybody more Christian than they
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.620]   already were.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:29.460]   In terms of swearing in court or in parliament, it was still being done on the Bible, which
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:35.420]   is still done even today, except, of course, if you are a Muslim, you can sort of do it
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.180]   in another book or not at all.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.440]   So that's the way that I would put it, yeah.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:53.380]   We do have an open door, however, in terms of reaching our politicians because of that,
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.380]   yeah.
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.380]   Thank you.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.860]   Thank you, Pastor Mbiwe.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:05.640]   My name is Alan, and I serve at a local church in here in Himosa Beach, and we have outreaches
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.140]   in different parts of the world.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:13.300]   And I'm involved in our missions, and one of the things that I've noticed is a lot of
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:18.760]   people that want to associate with us for whatever reason.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:27.060]   And what are the things that you would describe as ways to vet people that want to associate
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.460]   with you?
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.580]   And I know you have to, you know, you look at doctrinal things, you look at what is their
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:38.240]   teaching, but I'm interested to know because you've established a, you know, a seminary,
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.200]   and I know Voddie Blockham has been involved with you.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:48.960]   But in Africa, does your seminary, do you provide resources for people wanting to, from
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.720]   the West, that want to get involved with people in Africa, pastors in Africa, training resources
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:54.720]   for them?
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.480]   Because we see one of the problems is training as well.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:03.560]   A lot of the pastors are under-trained, and so they don't have the means and the scope
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:09.280]   to vet people even in their own situations, churches that they should be associated with.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.920]   So I'm just asking, do you have resources for that, for people, for churches over here
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.860]   that want to do that?
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:19.600]   Because there's a lot of people that want to associate with us, but we kind of are very
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.160]   careful about that because we see a lot of abuse.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.880]   Let me try and just answer that in a minute or two.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.120]   I think first of all, with respect to training in Africa itself, we tend to think in terms
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.440]   of a pyramid or a triangle.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:47.680]   So first of all, there is grassroots training, seminars, symposiums, sort of block classes,
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:56.720]   and some of them are just about exegesis of texts and turning that text into a sermon
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   and so forth.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:04.520]   So there's a lot of that happening at the grassroots level because, as you rightly pointed
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:12.400]   out, there's so much happening that if we try to limit our training to seminary training,
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.520]   it will be a drop in the ocean.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.480]   So there's a lot that's happening at grassroots level.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:27.080]   And then, but we are mindful that we need to train the kind of leaders who will lead
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.840]   the leaders.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:38.960]   And that's where this sort of, the tip of the pyramid comes in, where we are looking,
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.920]   which is what we do at the African Christian University, we are looking around the continent,
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:53.880]   seeing who are these guys who are sort of coming to the top so that we can train them
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.940]   and send them back.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:57:02.600]   And that way, what the Lord will do with them, we don't know, but at least we are helping
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   countries to then have the best trained pastors that we can.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.960]   Now some of them are training out in the West and coming back, but others train here and
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:21.920]   they stay, so we have the guys that we are training on the ground.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.720]   Now as to who do you associate with?
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:30.980]   My answer to that question is always, the way you do it even here in the West, it's
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:41.800]   who do you know who you can trust, who then knows someone else, who then knows that guy?
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:48.760]   Because that's safer than you simply getting an email from someone and they are claiming
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.660]   all kinds of things.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:54.720]   Because yes, they tend to know who you are and what you want to hear, and that's what
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.040]   they give you.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.800]   And a lot of Americans have ended up very disappointed when they finally got into the
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:09.000]   ground and found what they were supporting, they would not even want to be named next
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.160]   to that.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:16.340]   So think in terms of, you probably know one or two brethren that are already doing something
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.040]   in Africa.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:26.400]   Try and get a name from them that they already trust and know and then work your way to that.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:33.840]   For instance, I met somebody here who is working in, trying to get work going in East Africa,
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.360]   at least three countries.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.320]   And I said to him, send me, I gave him my business cards, shoot me an email, and what
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:45.680]   I'll do is I'll give you somebody in Uganda, somebody in Kenya, somebody in Tanzania, and
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.360]   you can, you know, continue working along those lines.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.600]   So that's what I would advise all of you, and I'm sure you do it even in America with
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:59:01.040]   respect to, you know, ministries and churches here, you can do it with us as well.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   Good.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.620]   I think you'll be the last one, brother.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.620]   We've got two minutes.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.320]   I'll make my question quick then.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.320]   Okay.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:19.080]   My question is, what can we do here in the West to partner with our brothers on the continent
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:24.520]   in terms of training, development, you know, what are some practical things we can do here
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.040]   with all the resources we've been blessed with so that we can be a blessing to you on
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.320]   the continent?
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.520]   Thank you.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:38.400]   The first is this, among yourselves, we don't need to have all of you traveling to Africa,
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:44.480]   but in your little sort of circle of pastors, fraternals, and churches that relate, at least
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:52.440]   get one of you to actually come and visit because it's difficult to describe what the
[00:59:52.440 --> 01:00:00.240]   Lord is doing on the ground, what the opportunities are there, but when you come, you mingle,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:10.960]   you lecture in our different levels of pastoral training, you come back, you are able to then
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:17.600]   speak to your friends in your fraternals and say, "Look, these are the needs that I saw
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.600]   on the ground.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.640]   These are the kind of things that we can be able to do."
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:28.860]   And there's no shortage in terms of needs for -- especially those of you who are pastors
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:37.640]   and others who are lecturing in Bible colleges, to come and, you know, minister in our churches.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:46.280]   Usually we have the wrong guys coming, and you guys are still on this side of the ocean.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:57.280]   So to do block classes, for instance, in our various colleges and seminars and so forth,
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:04.880]   and I can assure you what has often happened is this, and Vaud is a typical example.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:14.840]   He now sees the needs on the ground, and because one of his legs is on this side, he's able
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:22.440]   to see what this side can do on that other side, which we don't see.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.360]   And so I'd like to encourage you to do that.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:35.760]   And if any of you would like to attempt that, please get in touch with me.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:42.780]   Let's talk about it, because you may think that there's hardly anything that you can
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:45.320]   add to the African context.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.520]   Well, the extreme charismatics are not thinking like that.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:57.000]   They're literally filling up aeroplanes and crossing over, and sending a lot of free junk
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.280]   to Africa.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.640]   So I would like to encourage you to think like that.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.720]   Come over, see for yourselves, then you can come back and you'll be the ones saying, "I
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.360]   saw those gaps.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:19.720]   This is something that we can be able to do to strengthen the hands of the right guys
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:26.900]   on the African continent, so that as we are sending missionaries across Africa, even into
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:31.880]   North Africa, because for us it's the same continent.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   It's on land.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.480]   Guys get there.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.600]   That we are strengthened.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.320]   The church is more biblically based."
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:49.000]   Well, brethren, I don't want this to turn into African time.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.360]   I'm told here you stick to time, so let's pray together.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:01.960]   Our Father in heaven, thank you that history is your story.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:10.860]   You have worked around the world, you've worked in Africa, even in attempting to summarize
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:17.040]   two thousand years of African church history.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:22.680]   We can still see a few lessons percolating to the top.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:30.760]   We pray, Lord, that we may learn from both the positives and negatives in that history,
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:40.080]   and that today, with the baton in our hands, help us, O Lord, to be faithful, to catch
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:50.080]   in ourselves the wind that is blowing, so that we can make much of the opportunity for
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.580]   the good of the church and for the glory of God.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:04:00.720]   We pray this for Jesus' sake, amen.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   Thank you.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   [applause]
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.220]   [applause]
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.220]   [applause]
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:03.220]   [applause]
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.220]   [applause]
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:05.220]   [applause]
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.220]   [applause]
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:06.220]   [applause]
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.220]   [applause]
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:07.220]   [applause]
