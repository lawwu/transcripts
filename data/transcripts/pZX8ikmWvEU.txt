[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.300]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920]   My guest today is Dr. Stacey Sims.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.600]   Dr. Stacey Sims is an exercise physiologist
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.040]   and a nutrition scientist,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.220]   and a world expert in all things training and nutrition,
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.000]   specifically for women.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.480]   In addition to working at Stanford
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.920]   and with numerous professional athletic teams,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.800]   Dr. Sims has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed studies
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560]   on exercise physiology.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.240]   She has not only evaluated existing protocols
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.600]   for nutrition and fitness
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.860]   that are specific to women versus men,
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.360]   but she has also developed many new protocols
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.140]   that are now in practice with professional sports teams,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.040]   but that can also serve people
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   who are generally interested in fitness and longevity,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.400]   and in doing so, the general public.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.160]   The tools that Dr. Sims shares with us today
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.940]   are applicable to fitness,
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.480]   to changing your body composition, and to overall health.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.640]   Today, we discuss how hormones and hormone cycles
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640]   impact nutrition and fitness needs,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.080]   specifically in women of different ages.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.120]   We, of course, discuss the menstrual cycle,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.960]   perimenopause, and menopause,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.800]   but also female-specific nutrition and training
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.880]   as it relates to things independent of hormones.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.140]   For instance, we evaluate the evidence
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.760]   that women may not want to train fasted,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.240]   and the reasons for that.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   We talk about how training might vary
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.920]   according to different phases of the menstrual cycle,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.680]   and we discuss how women can design
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040]   nutrition and training programs
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.400]   that are optimized for their specific needs,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   not just because they are women,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.760]   but because they are women of a particular stage of life
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.000]   and women with particular goals.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.540]   As you'll soon see, Dr. Sims is exquisitely skilled
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.400]   at explaining the human universals
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.320]   of nutrition and training,
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.200]   that is, the things that do not differ
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.500]   between men and women and their needs
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.280]   in terms of nutrition and training,
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.820]   but she is also exquisitely skilled
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.400]   at highlighting the data showing
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.680]   that there are specific areas of nutrition and fitness
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.840]   for which women and men differ,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.360]   and women have specific needs.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.360]   So today you will learn what those are,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.040]   and you will learn how to apply those specific protocols,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.240]   such that by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960]   you will be armed with a tremendous amount of new knowledge
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.800]   about the biological mechanisms
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.320]   and the specific do's and do not's
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.520]   that can guide you towards
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   your female-specific health and fitness goals.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.440]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.880]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.120]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.040]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.320]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.600]   to the general public.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.040]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.440]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.440]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.000]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.700]   and with several expert guests on this podcast,
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.560]   about the fact that most of us should be seeking
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.520]   to get about one gram of high-quality protein
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.040]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.540]   Not only does that protein provide critical building blocks
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.680]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080]   but also for overall metabolism and health.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.980]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high-quality protein
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.520]   per calorie ratio,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.600]   so that you can get that one gram of protein
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.520]   per pound of body weight easily
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.120]   and without ingesting an excess of calories.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.760]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.400]   I love their venison steaks, their ground venison,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.480]   I love their bone broths, and I love their jerky,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.540]   which is extremely convenient when you're traveling.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.340]   Those Maui Nui Venison jerky sticks
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.580]   have 10 grams of high-quality protein per stick
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.340]   at just 55 calories.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.940]   While Maui Nui offers the highest-quality meat available,
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.600]   their supplies are limited.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.140]   Responsible management of the Axis deer population
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.480]   on the island of Maui
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.160]   means that they will not go beyond harvest capacity.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.080]   So signing up for a membership is the best way
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.440]   to ensure access to their high-quality meat.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.580]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.240]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.720]   to get 20% off your membership or first order.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.680]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.720]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.560]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.020]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.460]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.540]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.940]   One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.440]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.840]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.880]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.360]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.040]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.120]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.960]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.940]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.440]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.200]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.360]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.680]   and end of the night.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.560]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.200]   for well over three years now,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.420]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.660]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.100]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.980]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.140]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.300]   and it also has snoring detection
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.580]   that remarkably will automatically lift your head
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.700]   a few degrees to improve your airflow
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.820]   and stop your snoring.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.820]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.980]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.960]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.240]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.800]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.520]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.000]   that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.360]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.680]   I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.320]   and it made a profound impact on my life.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.660]   And by now, there are thousands
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.240]   of quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.500]   that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.240]   for improving our focus, managing stress and anxiety,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.520]   improving our mood, and much more.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.360]   In recent years,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.820]   I started using the Waking Up app for my meditations
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.980]   because I find it to be a terrific resource
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.740]   for allowing me to really be consistent
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.540]   with my meditation practice.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.500]   Many people start a meditation practice
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.940]   and experience some benefits,
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.700]   but many people also have challenges
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.340]   keeping up with that practice.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.860]   What I and so many other people love
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.900]   about the Waking Up app
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.700]   is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.260]   and those meditations are of different durations.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.400]   So it makes it very easy
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.360]   to keep up with your meditation practice,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.260]   both from the perspective of novelty,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.940]   you never get tired of those meditations,
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.520]   there's always something new to explore
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.780]   and to learn about yourself
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.180]   and about the effectiveness of meditation.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.860]   And you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.660]   even if you only have two or three minutes per day
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.780]   in which to meditate.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.420]   I also really like doing yoga nidra
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.820]   or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.380]   for about 10 or 20 minutes
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.620]   because it is a great way to restore mental
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.820]   and physical vigor without the tiredness
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.700]   that some people experience
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.540]   when they wake up from a conventional nap.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.080]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.940]   please go to wakingup.com/huberman

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.040]   to access a free 30-day trial.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.640]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Stacey Sims.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.780]   Dr. Stacey Sims, welcome.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.260]   - Thanks.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.900]   - Our podcast and I put out a lot of content
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.900]   about nutrition, fitness, cold exposure,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.380]   heat exposure, hydration,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.580]   topics that are very near and dear to your heart
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.620]   and for which you have a ton of expertise,
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.880]   but for which you have an extra degree of expertise
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.220]   as it relates to females specifically.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.040]   - Yeah.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.540]   - So I'm excited to talk to you today
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.860]   because very often I will get questions
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.660]   in the comment section on social media or on YouTube.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.760]   Was this study done in both men and women?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.700]   How does it differ for men versus women?
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.540]   And on and on.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.420]   And I rarely, if ever have answers, but you have answers.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.740]   - I have answers for you.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.740]   - Great.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.740]   So just to kick things off,
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.760]   because this is a question I get really often.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.460]   Fasting.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.300]   - Oh yeah.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.620]   - Intermittent fasting.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.460]   - Yep.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.460]   - We need to distinguish between the two, of course.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.420]   Perhaps the most common question I get
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.660]   as it relates to males versus females
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.140]   is intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.500]   as it's sometimes called.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.820]   An eight hour feeding window, a six hour feeding window,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.820]   a 10 hour feeding window.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.700]   Is that something that perhaps differs
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.020]   in terms of its impact
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.020]   and how well it works for men versus women?
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.220]   - Yeah.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.660]   That's a short answer.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.500]   - Great.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   So I'll put some parameters around it, right?
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.700]   So if we talk about intermittent fasting,
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.540]   that's where you have like the 20 hour non-feeding window
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.320]   or you're holding a fast until noon or after.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.340]   And then we have time-restricted eating
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.760]   and that's the fancy way of saying normal eating
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.940]   where you're having breakfast
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.540]   and then you stop eating after,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.100]   or you don't have anything after dinner, right?
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.780]   So you're eating with your circadian rhythm during the day.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.220]   If we look at intermittent fasting
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.740]   where you're holding the fast up till noon
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.300]   or you're having days of really low calorie restriction,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.180]   we see in active women, it's very detrimental
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.820]   unless you have PCOS
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.980]   or you have some other subclinical issue.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.420]   And the reason for that is we, as women,
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.260]   have more oxidative fibers.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.140]   So we hear about all the things about fasting
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.600]   to improve our metabolic flexibility,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.940]   to improve telomere length,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.540]   to improve parasympathetic activation.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.660]   But by the nature of women having more oxidative fibers,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.600]   we are already metabolically more flexible than men.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.440]   - Interesting.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.780]   - Yeah. - I didn't know that.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.260]   Could you elaborate on more oxidative fibers,
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.180]   what that is and how it relates to metabolic flexibility?
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.020]   - Sure, sure.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.180]   So oxidative fibers are muscle fibers
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.940]   that are more aerobic capacity.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.780]   So those are the ones that you can go long and slow
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.880]   for a very long period of time
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.340]   because it uses a lot of free fatty acids.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.980]   You need a little bit of glucose
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.380]   in order to activate those free fatty acids.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.300]   So when we look, when a woman starts to exercise,
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.080]   she goes through blood glucose first
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.460]   and then gets into free fatty acid use.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.820]   She doesn't tap so much into liver and muscle glycogen,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.860]   which is, I think, another misconception that happens.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.860]   So when we're talking about fasting or fasted workouts,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.020]   trying to improve that metabolic flexibility,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.300]   it increases stress on the woman.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.500]   And so when we're talking about overall stress,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.700]   we're talking about cortisol increase
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.300]   and they can't hit intensities high enough
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.940]   with no fuel to be able to invoke
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.300]   the post-exercise responses of growth hormone
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   and testosterone, which then drop cortisol.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.760]   So from an overall stress perspective,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.780]   that fasted workout and holding that fast
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.260]   for a long period of time increases cortisol.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.500]   But then when we look from like a hypothalamic point of view
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.300]   and we're looking at how the brain reads it,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.300]   so we know that there's one area of cispeptin neurons
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.820]   in the brain for men, but there are two for women.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.820]   So the two areas are distinct where one controls appetite
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.580]   and luteinizing hormone, and the other one
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.820]   is looking at estrogen and thyroid.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.940]   So if you start having an exercise stress
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.380]   or a daily stress of getting up and going on with your day
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.480]   without fuel, you perturb those cispeptin neurons
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.700]   and downregulate them.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.860]   And so when you start downregulating them,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.340]   we see that after four days,
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.940]   you have a dysregulation of thyroid.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.700]   We have a change in our luteinizing hormone pulse,
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.300]   which is really important to maintain endocrine function.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.460]   And we'll hear this, oh, I've been fasting for so many years
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.080]   and it does great for me.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.620]   But the other side of the question is, well,
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.380]   how much better would you be if you were to actually
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.340]   pay attention to your circadian rhythm
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.580]   and fuel according to the stress at hand
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.420]   and knowing that you're gonna garner less stress that way.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.020]   And if we're really tying in nutrition
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.260]   according to that profile, instead of following a fast,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.980]   we see better brain improvements as well.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.660]   We see more cognitive function.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.220]   We see less thyroid dysfunction.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.260]   And overall, a woman does much better
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.660]   when we're not in that fasted state.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.660]   Then when you look at population research
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.240]   that's coming out now, they're showing in both men and women
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.260]   who hold their fast till noon and then have an eating window
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.860]   from noon to maybe 6 p.m. have more obesogenic outcomes
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.100]   than people who break their fast at eight
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.900]   and finished their eating window by four or 5 p.m.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.960]   So it's coming back to the chronobiology
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.500]   of we need to eat when our body is under stress and needs it
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   unless we have a specific issue like obesity,
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.820]   inactivity, PCOS, or other metabolic conditions,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.300]   then we can look at using fasting
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.300]   as a strategic intervention to help with those modalities.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   - Super interesting, two questions.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.620]   Is there a protective effect of starting the eating window,
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.500]   and here I'm asking for both men and women,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.540]   starting the eating window at say 11 a.m. or noon
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.380]   and ending it a little bit later,
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.340]   so not a six-hour eating window or seven-hour eating window,
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.520]   but extending that to eight or 9 p.m.?
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.580]   Under those conditions,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.340]   do you still see the obesogenic effect?
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.420]   - Yes, because we're looking at the way cortisol responds.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.880]   We know cortisol has lots of fluctuations
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.220]   throughout the day, and it peaks
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.140]   about half an hour after you wake up, right?
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.460]   So if you're having that cortisol peak
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.940]   half an hour after you wake up but you're not eating,
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.380]   then that is that higher baseline
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.900]   sympathetic drive for women.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.100]   For men, it's not the same.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.980]   So when we're looking at that obesogenic outcome,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.300]   the actual timing hasn't been tested yet
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.340]   to see how can we expand or contract
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.180]   that eating window for men.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.580]   But for women, because of that cortisol peak,
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.120]   that right after waking up,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.680]   women tend to be already sympathetically driven.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.080]   So then they walk around more tired but wired
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.680]   and have a really, really difficult time
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.140]   accessing any kind of parasympathetic responses down the way.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.720]   Where if you have something really small
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.180]   where you're bringing blood sugar up,
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.760]   then it's signaling to the hypothalamus,
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.880]   "Hey, yeah, there's some nutrition on board."
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.460]   Then we can start our day.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.100]   So again, it has to look at that circadian rhythm
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.680]   and those hormone fluxes,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.080]   which people don't really either understand or talk about
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.940]   'cause all of our hormones flux through the day.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.960]   And so you have to look at where's the peak of cortisol?
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.220]   How does estrogen flux?
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.460]   How does luteinizing hormone flux?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.100]   Progesterone, all of these things
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.940]   that have this tight interplay.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.240]   And the more we're doing the hormone research
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.380]   and the more we're understanding these perturbations
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.100]   and how important it is to fuel for it,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.180]   to stay out of any kind of low energy availability stance.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.500]   - Regular listeners of this podcast will know this,
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.880]   but just to remind everybody,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.760]   a sympathetic state has nothing to do
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.840]   with emotional sympathy.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.180]   It's the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.320]   which drives more arousal and alertness
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.360]   and at higher levels stress,
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.000]   sometimes called the fight or flight response.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.080]   Parasympathetic being the other arm
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.240]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.840]   sometimes called the rest and digest arm
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.260]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.480]   They work sort of like a seesaw or a push-pull,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.380]   pick your analogy.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.380]   In any case, it sounds like intermittent fasting
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.000]   or time-restricted feeding,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.620]   unless it's very well aligned to the circadian rhythm,
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.920]   is not going to be advantageous for women.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.080]   That's what I'm hearing.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.840]   I'm also hearing that if a woman trains while fasted,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.720]   so in the non-feeding window,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   so wakes up, maybe has some hydration and trains,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.520]   that's going to further exacerbate the stress response
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.440]   in a way that's not going to be good.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.280]   - Exactly.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   - And I have to imagine that if she also is drinking caffeine
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.620]   in order to do that training,
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.380]   because caffeine is a stimulant of the sympathetic arm
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.900]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.060]   that it will further exacerbate all these issues.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.860]   So this is a eye-opener for me
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.300]   because I've had female training partners for years.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   I don't eat until 11 a.m.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.420]   I like to hydrate and caffeinate
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.660]   before I train in the morning.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.860]   And then I like to eat starting around noon.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.800]   Several of them have hopped on that schedule with me.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.120]   Some of them eat breakfast first, some of them don't.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.080]   They do as they choose, of course.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.080]   But now I'm thinking that's probably the worst way to go.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.380]   - And it gets worse as you get older.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.360]   Because if we're seeing,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.520]   as women are getting into perimenopause,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.760]   which is in their forties,
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.080]   and we have more fluctuation of those hormones
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.600]   and an increase in baseline cortisol anyway,
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.300]   then when you look at fasted training,
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.580]   it increases that cortisol drive and that sympathetic drive.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.860]   And because it's at a point
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.260]   where you really need to polarize your training
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.100]   to get any kind of body composition change,
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.180]   not having any fuel before a high-intensity workout
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.660]   puts them in moderate intensity.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.260]   They just can't hit the intensities they need to.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.860]   Same with resistance training.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.460]   Like you go in, and a lot of women are now working
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.580]   on sessional RPE, or rating perceived exertion,
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.720]   where you go in and say,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.560]   "Okay, we need you to hit an eight on the squat."
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.060]   So you have two reps in reserve
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.560]   and a sessional RPE of an eight.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.360]   Well, if they're not fueled,
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.680]   then we are seeing trends that they're missing
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.860]   around two to 5% of that top load.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.840]   So they're not really lifting in that zone
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.000]   that they need to be in.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.600]   - Let's get people, sorry to interrupt.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.280]   Let's get people up to speed on RPE.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.360]   'Cause this is a term that's starting to circulate more
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.880]   outside the physical training community
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.460]   and to the broader recreational exerciser community,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.300]   which I consider myself part of.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.140]   - Me too now.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.540]   - I mean, I train regularly and have for years,
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.100]   but I'm not an athlete.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.900]   I don't get paid to train and so forth.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.580]   So reps in reserve, perceived effort.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.060]   Maybe just explain this.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.460]   I think probably 95% of our listenership
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.680]   has never heard these terms.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.140]   - Okay, so if we're talking about reps in reserve,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.780]   this is when you go in and if you say eight,
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.880]   it means you have two reps in reserve.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.900]   So you finish your eight and you should be able
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.160]   to complete two more with a really good form
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.500]   and then you hit failure.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.220]   - So eight repetitions in good form
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.220]   and the person doing the exercise could in theory,
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.180]   if they really dug in there, grit their teeth,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.260]   could complete two more repetitions in good form
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.440]   before hitting failure.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.260]   The inability to move the weight anymore in good form.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.100]   - Exactly.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.160]   - Okay, but they're stopping at eight.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.620]   So they have two reps in reserve.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.260]   - Exactly and so we can correspond that
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.660]   with your rating perceived exertion.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.280]   So if we're saying we need you to hit an eight
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.100]   on our scale of one to 10 of rating perceived exertion,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.340]   we see correlates with that eight with two reps in reserve.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.760]   So it's a way of quantifying what you're doing
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.140]   in the moment for a squat or a deadlift
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.660]   or some other really heavy lift
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.460]   that you're trying to accomplish.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.580]   - As opposed to looking at say percentage
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.380]   of one repetition maximum.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.220]   - Yeah.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.080]   - Saying you're gonna move 70% of your one repetition
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.460]   maximum for six repetitions.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.220]   Seems like that's a great thing as well,
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.780]   but it's a little bit more complicated
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.900]   because you need to know your one repetition maximum.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.040]   Doing one repetition maximums can be dangerous
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:16.980]   if you're not skilled in that,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.220]   especially with compound movements
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.980]   like squats and deadlifts.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.620]   Okay, so is there an across the board recommendation
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.620]   for most people that they should generally train their sets
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   in good form to failure, to leave a couple reps in reserve?
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   What do you suggest for, let's say women,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.200]   but this could also pertain to men.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.880]   - And then that also depends on the age of the woman.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.800]   So if we're looking at the reproductive years,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   so 20 to 40, then it doesn't matter so much.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.920]   You can periodize pretty much how normal periodization works
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.960]   with your mesocycles and your microcycles.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.440]   So you're looking at what you're doing
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.480]   across a few months, what are you doing in the week?
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.040]   Are you lifting heavy, power-based training?
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.960]   But when we start to get to perimenopause
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.400]   and we're losing all the flux of estrogen,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.560]   and estrogen is the woman's testosterone,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.880]   the key driver for strength and power,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.960]   we have to look at lifting heavy.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.120]   So this is where we really turn women on to,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.700]   we want you to do something that is two reps in reserve,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.200]   three reps in reserve,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.320]   because your one rep max also changes
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.800]   depending on what kind of training block you're doing.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.480]   So we're finding that when you're talking
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.600]   about reps in reserve, then it allows people
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.320]   to lift more on the day.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.960]   So we can get women to get into that strength
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.000]   and power-based type training,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.040]   rather than going, let's lift to fatigue,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.960]   'cause then it might be 20 reps.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.880]   And that 20 reps doesn't invoke
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.940]   a big central nervous system response,
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.840]   which is what we want.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.720]   It's more of that hypertrophy and muscle tearing.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.600]   You will gain some lean mass,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.980]   but not as much strength as if you were to invoke
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.880]   that central nervous system response.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.120]   And that becomes really critical as women get older,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.600]   because we need to find that external response
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.920]   that's gonna cause the same kind of strength
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.880]   and power adaptation that estrogen used to support.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.720]   - Interesting.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.580]   Lots to talk about in terms of exercise,
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.060]   but before we move on,
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.060]   if the bad situation is a woman fasting,
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.640]   drinking caffeine, and training intensely,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.500]   but as you told us, not as intensely
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.540]   as she would be able to otherwise,
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.380]   what's the solution?
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.480]   I imagine that solution involves ingesting some fuel.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   What is a good example of a pre-training meal, if you will?
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:39.040]   And we could put some variation on that
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.520]   for people with different tendencies
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.840]   towards omnivore or vegan or whatever.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.140]   But what is the timing of that meal relative to training
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.720]   that works best?
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.840]   And I'm assuming there's some flexibility there.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.520]   - Yeah, I mean, like I'm the kind of person
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.200]   gets up and is out the door within a half an hour
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.480]   to go do whatever I'm gonna do.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.920]   So it's not like I'm gonna have a full meal.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.440]   - I've heard of people like you, yeah.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.320]   Meaning I tend to move slowly in the morning.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.080]   - I wish I could, but the way my life is,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.320]   it doesn't work that way.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.720]   But I'm also one of the people
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.880]   that never really has an appetite till 11 o'clock.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.520]   - Okay, so we're similar in that way.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.920]   So how do you square that?
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.720]   - So I make a double espresso at night
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.120]   and I put some almond milk
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.800]   and a scoop of protein powder in there.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.480]   So the almond milk is sweetened
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.420]   and usually it's unsweetened, but sweetened for the carb.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.400]   And then the protein powder for the protein,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.260]   because if I'm gonna go do an ocean swim,
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.760]   then I need some carbohydrate and protein on board.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.360]   If I'm gonna just go to the gym,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.320]   then I'll probably just have the protein powder
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.560]   in the coffee.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.320]   Yes, I'm caffeinating, but I'm also getting the calories
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.240]   for the hypothalamus
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.820]   and getting some more circulating amino acids.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.720]   Abby Smith-Ryan out of UNC did some specific work
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   looking at carbohydrate, protein, strength, or cardio
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.480]   and found that if you're gonna do
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.200]   a true strength training session,
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.560]   you only need around 15 grams of protein before you go
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.520]   to really help you get into the idea
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.280]   that yes, you have some fuel on board
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.200]   and also increases your post-exercise oxygen consumption
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.920]   or your EPOC, so your resting metabolism stays elevated,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.040]   giving you a better chance for recovery
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.600]   post-exercise as well.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.380]   If you're going to do any kind of cardiovascular type work
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.400]   up to an hour, then you're adding 30 grams of carb to that.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.600]   So it's not a lot of food and it's not a full meal.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.240]   Other people are like, I'm starving right before I go
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.200]   training, then yes, you can have your meal,
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.960]   giving yourself about half an hour before,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.580]   but it doesn't have to be major food
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.640]   that we're talking about.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.480]   But that's just enough to bring blood sugar up
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.880]   and stimulate the hypothalamus to say,
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.740]   yeah, there's some nutrition coming in.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.240]   And then you have your real food afterwards.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.480]   You have your breakfast afterwards within 45 minutes.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   - As a neuroscientist, I find it so interesting
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.400]   that at least some of what you're talking about
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.800]   with this pre-workout meal, and perhaps most of it
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.720]   relates to how ingesting those calories impacts the brain,
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.760]   protects those cispeptin neurons.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.400]   We'll talk more about cispeptin, very interesting peptide.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.860]   As opposed to saying, okay, you need X number of calories,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.000]   because you're going to burn X number of calories.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.840]   - I hate that conversation.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.200]   - Right, which is a very different conversation.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.600]   Here, what we're talking about is the neural aspects
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.640]   of being able to generate intensity, also blunt cortisol,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.440]   and get the most out of training without putting the body
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.280]   into kind of an emergency state.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.120]   - Yeah.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.040]   And the longer someone withholds food after exercise,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.920]   and the greater they stay in that catabolic
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.880]   or breakdown state, the more the brain perceives it
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.480]   as being in a low energy state.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.940]   So the first thing to go is lean mass.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.700]   When you start telling a woman that, you know,
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.280]   if you're going to do fasted training,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.740]   and/or you're going to delay food intake afterwards,
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.900]   why are you training?
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.100]   Because the first thing that goes is lean mass,
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.260]   and it's really, really hard for women to put on lean mass.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.660]   So once you start really nailing that, and then saying,
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.680]   look, you just need 15 grams of protein to really help
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.940]   and be able to conserve that lean mass,
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.900]   it's a small, simple fix.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.300]   People try it, and they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.400]   I feel amazing.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.480]   So it's small little things when you're working
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.800]   with the whole system.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.980]   'Cause I get tired, especially around Christmas time
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.340]   when you're reading all the magazines, it's like,
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.800]   two cookies means you have to walk for 30 minutes
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.640]   on the treadmill.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.820]   It's like, it doesn't correlate like that at all.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.100]   So that's why I was like, I hate the calorie conversation,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.200]   because it's just not applicable.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.620]   - Right, and it has its own kind of elements
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.500]   of being laced with neuroticism about calorie counting,
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.420]   and then that can drift easily into the realm
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.380]   of eating disorders.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.260]   I did an episode about eating disorders some years ago,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.080]   and as I was researching that episode,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.340]   I learned that people with eating disorders,
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.200]   women and men, especially anorexia,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.840]   become like calorie calculators.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.180]   Their eyes and their brain just are constantly evaluating
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.540]   the caloric load of food,
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.540]   and it can be obviously very intrusive.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.020]   It's also the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.940]   So that's a long way from hopefully
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.380]   what we're talking about here,
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.900]   but there's the opportunity for drift
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.100]   whenever we're talking about calorie counting in and out.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.260]   We, of course, believe in the laws of thermodynamics
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.980]   and calories in, calories out,
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.780]   but I love what you're describing here
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.260]   as getting the brain in a mode
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.180]   that the brain and body are protected
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.380]   so that one can invest in that high-intensity exercise
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.580]   and get the adaptations that one wants,
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.000]   but not send everything down this pathway
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   of just becoming a computer of how much am I exercising?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.100]   What did I burn?
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.940]   What did I earn?
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.460]   It's- - Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.020]   - It's crazy. - Yeah.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.720]   - As long as we're talking about food
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.400]   and food intake relative to training,
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   what is the suggested post-training window
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.760]   in which one should either avoid
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.980]   or make sure they get nutrition,
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.080]   meaning how long does one have after,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.100]   let's say, a resistance training session of about an hour?
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.740]   Seems to me that's what most people are doing
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.300]   if they're investing in resistance training,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.140]   maybe plus or minus, what, 20 minutes?
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.300]   - Yeah.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.500]   - And they're hitting those high-intensity sets
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.560]   where they have maybe just one or two repetitions in reserve,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.340]   maybe going to failure on a few of those sets.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.260]   What do you recommend women eat after they train?
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.740]   - So we know that women who are in their reproductive years
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.260]   need around 35 grams of good protein,
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.820]   high-quality leucine-oriented protein within 45 minutes.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.240]   And we see that women who are perimenopausal onwards
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.180]   are 40 to 60 grams
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.580]   because we become more anabolically resistant
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.800]   to food and exercise as we get older.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.760]   When we look at the recovery window for food,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.380]   there are definitely sex differences
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.820]   'cause we hear all the conversation of,
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.680]   there's no recovery window, it's old science.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.720]   But we look at the research of when women's metabolisms
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.840]   come back down to baseline,
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.500]   meaning that they have constant,
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.440]   straight blood sugar levels versus men.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.520]   Women, it's within 60 minutes.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.500]   And for men, it's up to three hours.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.220]   So when we're looking at the data that says
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.060]   there's no window, per se, for getting food in,
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.460]   it's based on male data.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.300]   So when we're looking at women,
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.780]   we have this tighter window to stop that breakdown effect
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.280]   and start the reparation.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.820]   So yeah, it's like,
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.940]   when we're talking about the protein intake,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.380]   it's really important,
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.540]   not only to get that leucine content up in the muscle,
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.900]   to start the reparation or repair,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.860]   but also again, to signal that, yeah,
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.500]   we're in a building state.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.440]   We're not holding that catabolic state
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.300]   and increasing all the repercussions that come with it.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.920]   - So women should try and get 30
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.220]   or as much as 40, maybe 50 grams of protein,
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.420]   depending on their age,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.060]   post-training, within an hour of training.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.900]   Men seem to have a longer window.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.740]   They could wait an hour, two hours,
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.340]   maybe even three hours before ingesting protein.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.820]   What about carbohydrate?
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.060]   - We look at mixed, but for men it's more important
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.280]   because they go through their liver and muscle glycogen
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.420]   so much faster than women.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.620]   So when we look at women,
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.620]   we want to get around 0.3 grams per kilo of carbohydrate
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.780]   within two hours of finishing.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.740]   So we look at protein and people are like,
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.860]   well, that's a big dose of protein.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.900]   How do I get it all in?
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.020]   It's like, yeah, well,
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.020]   you can look at how we mix all of these things.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.360]   You're also getting carbohydrate in with that.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.640]   So that's why I say you could have your next meal
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.300]   after your training session.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.620]   Yeah, there's a time and a place
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.200]   for protein supplementation,
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.980]   but if you're getting that real food
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.700]   and then you're also getting your magnesium
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.580]   and your potassium and your sodium
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.180]   and all the things that people supposedly lose,
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.220]   and you're able to also repair a lot better.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.060]   - As many of you know,
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.980]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.440]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.180]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.300]   Rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.700]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.420]   And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.020]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.180]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.160]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.500]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.220]   a vegetarian or a vegan,
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.380]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.920]   that you should get most of your food
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.940]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.440]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.020]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.020]   probiotics and micronutrients
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.460]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.260]   Now, I personally am an omnivore
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.800]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.580]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.580]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.180]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.920]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.740]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.020]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.720]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.940]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.980]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.620]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.320]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.340]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.500]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.700]   So while many supplements out there are really directed
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.060]   towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.820]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.020]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.540]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.940]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.380]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.800]   to claim a special offer.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.920]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.540]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.900]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.340]   - At some point, there was a lot of discussion
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.820]   about training fasted burns more body fat.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.820]   I think now most people accept that that's not the case,
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.020]   that perhaps the percentage of fat as fuel
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.660]   is increased when one trains fasted,
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.980]   but that overall in terms of loss of body fat,
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.560]   it doesn't matter if you train fasted or you train fed.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.400]   - Correct.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.260]   - Okay, I think that can't be stated enough.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.540]   By experts like you,
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.420]   that doesn't mean that if one prefers to train fasted
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.020]   or with a minimum of food in their gut
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.100]   that they can't do that.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.140]   Like I like to train fasted,
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.660]   but what I'm hearing is that women should probably ingest
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.180]   at least some protein, high quality protein,
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.860]   and maybe drink the protein in a protein shake form
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.900]   if they don't want to ingest solid food.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.940]   - Yeah, I think the easiest way for people to understand
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.900]   the basic idea of what low energy is
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.060]   and how this affects men and women
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.340]   is when we are looking at a tipping point
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.300]   for endocrine dysfunction.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.260]   For men, we're seeing that tipping point
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.180]   at 15 calories per kilogram of fat free mass.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.020]   For women, it's 30.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.360]   So when we're looking at baseline calorie needs
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   before you really get into that endocrine dysfunction,
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.460]   when you're looking at those parameters,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.340]   you can see why men do better in a fasted state
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.140]   or a low calorie state.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.580]   But for women, our intake
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.140]   and especially our carbohydrate needs are so much higher
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.100]   because we have so many other functions
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.700]   that are reliant on that cispeptin upregulation
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.400]   or downregulation, preferably upregulation.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.500]   So when we're just talking the basic calorie needs
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.340]   and what we're seeing,
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.260]   it's that dichotomy right there of 15 to 30.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.580]   And when you start telling people that,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.020]   they're like, oh, okay, I get it.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.020]   Is that a biological aspect?
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.220]   It's like, well, you could trace it all the way back
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.820]   where men went out to get the calories
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.660]   and most tribes and the women were home
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.580]   and it wasn't advantageous to be pregnant
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.420]   under low calorie intake.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.680]   That's why you have dysfunction
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.700]   when the calories are too low.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.900]   But you can also feed forward to modern day now
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.860]   and you're seeing that all this perturbance of hormone
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.580]   and the way we regulate hormone across the circadian rhythm
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.480]   requires more calories for women than it does for men.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.180]   - I know some men that basically don't eat all day
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.700]   and then eat one meal in the evening
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:18.740]   and they'll train in the morning.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.140]   That's inconceivable to me
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.580]   because within an hour or so of training, I'm hungry.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.820]   Which brings to mind what we mean when we say training.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.540]   I'm a big believer in people,
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.340]   everybody getting ideally two
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.900]   or three resistance training sessions in per week
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.940]   and two, maybe three cardiovascular training sessions
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.760]   per week.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.220]   That would be ideal.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.380]   One could potentially do more,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.860]   probably not a whole lot less
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.060]   before you run into long-term health issues
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.260]   that you could offset.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.700]   But I think most people can fit those in
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.760]   and I'm very frankly delighted that nowadays
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.260]   there's such a push for women and men to resistance train.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.580]   That wasn't the case when I was growing up.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.920]   You know, I recall taking my sister to the gym
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.460]   for the first time and it's like,
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.580]   I think she was the only woman in the gym
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.780]   when we were in high school.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.540]   Except for a few female bodybuilders
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.020]   and she said, "Well, I don't wanna look like that."
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:12.860]   And I said, "Well, don't worry,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.820]   "you're not gonna look like that."
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.740]   But now you go to a gym and women are lifting weights,
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.580]   men are lifting weights.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.780]   - It's great. - It's terrific.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.580]   - I've seen the evolution, right?
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.420]   When I was 16, one of my friend's brothers
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.600]   was a bodybuilder and he took us to the gym,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.180]   kind of like what you did with your sister.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.740]   And so both of us were like,
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.260]   "Oh, we wanna beat those guys."
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.420]   So we got into weight training with him,
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.340]   not to be a bodybuilder,
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.540]   but it's been like the paramount
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.540]   throughout all of my athletic career.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.900]   Used to be I'd be the only woman on the lifting platform.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.860]   And now it's like, you have to wait
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.100]   because there's so many women on the lifting platforms.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.260]   I love it, it's great.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.100]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.940]   As I mentioned before, I've had female training partners
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.900]   and they kill it.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.820]   It's a lot of fun to have a female training partner
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.020]   also because not only is it cool
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.940]   to see the progress they can make really quickly,
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.620]   which surprises them often.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.220]   I think a lot of women think that,
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.300]   okay, it's going to require external androgens
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.460]   or it's going, you know,
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.280]   and what you pointed out that there are some barriers
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.420]   to women putting on mass quickly.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.500]   I think I've noticed that strength increases
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.300]   can come really quickly.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.140]   Why is that?
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.540]   - It's a central nervous system aspect.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.620]   There's a lot of, like, if we look at the culture
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.060]   of how a lot of us grew up,
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.360]   I'm saying us like 45 plus, right?
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   The women were all the 90s supermodels
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.940]   don't show muscle, that kind of stuff.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.220]   So always been gravitated to cardio.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.340]   Even now, if you go to a gym and you're a new member,
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.540]   you're signing up for a new member and you're a woman,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.300]   they'll say, hey, great, here's all of our spin classes
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.580]   and our box fit classes.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.420]   - You're still doing that?
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.260]   - Yeah, and there's the cardiovascular machines.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.220]   A guy comes in like, all right,
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.700]   how much do you want to put on?
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.340]   Here are the lifting platforms,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.140]   all the weight trainings at the back.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.700]   Starting to see a shift with boutique type gyms,
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.720]   but that's still the commonality there.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.200]   So it's still that little bit of taboo.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.920]   So when women start strength training,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.340]   they haven't been exposed to that kind of
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.700]   central nervous system stress before.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.540]   And the whole aspect of getting the nerve
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.260]   and the acetylcholine, which are little vesicles
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.380]   that hold the ability for the nerve
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.260]   to actually stimulate the muscle fiber,
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.340]   all that gets trained really quickly.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.900]   So the more that you train it
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.920]   and the more muscle fibers that are recruited
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.780]   for contraction, you see an increase
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.380]   in strength really rapidly.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.380]   And slowly building on that for increased muscle bulk,
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.720]   because it takes a long time for women to put bulk on.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.300]   Because the driver for strength training
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.960]   is that central nervous system.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.580]   So it's great when we see higher doses, more volume,
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.860]   we aren't seeing huge hypertrophy,
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.120]   we're just seeing really good increases in strength.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.260]   - Whenever somebody, male or female,
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.060]   is concerned about growing too big too fast,
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.780]   I always remind them that resistance training
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.500]   is unique among different types of exercise
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.580]   in that because of the blood flow to the muscle
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.940]   during the exercise session, the so-called pump,
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.340]   you get a window, a transient window,
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.860]   but a window nonetheless of what the hypertrophy
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   could look like if you do everything else correctly
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.180]   in terms of recovery.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.380]   So provided that the size of the muscle
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.600]   during the training session is not aversive to you,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.440]   you're okay.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.800]   - You're good, yeah.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.280]   - Which is unique among training.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.360]   It's not like when you go running,
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.120]   you get a sense of being much faster.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.560]   You actually get the opposite effect.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.860]   You feel the burn in your lungs
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.840]   and the pain of hitting the wall of your limits.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.160]   And then hopefully if the adaptation takes place,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.720]   then you can push past that next time.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.600]   But with resistance training,
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.520]   you get literally a physical picture
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.200]   and a somatic feeling for what that hypertrophy
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.040]   could look like.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.880]   - Yeah, that's why on your physique competitions
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.080]   and bodybuilding competitions,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   they're out the back pumping before they go on stage.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.320]   - So we've been talking about training,
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.680]   but we haven't really spelled out
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.080]   what you would suggest a novice,
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.580]   perhaps an intermediate resistance training,
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.880]   cardiovascular training program would look like
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.980]   in broad terms.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.400]   I realize we don't have time here
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.200]   to get into all the nitty gritty details.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   You've written about this elsewhere
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.320]   and we'll refer people to those terrific resources
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.340]   in the show note captions.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.920]   But what would you like to see women doing?
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.300]   And maybe we can break up the age brackets
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.960]   because it sounds like this is something
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.760]   that is resurfacing again and again here.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.800]   Women, let's say 30 and younger,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.520]   women 31 to let's say 40,
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.540]   and then let's say 41 to 60,
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.560]   and then maybe 61 and on.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.460]   In terms of how many sessions
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.020]   of resistance training per week?
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.240]   Is it whole body training?
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.840]   How many sessions of cardiovascular training?
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.640]   And what sorts of examples could you give?
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.740]   - Yeah, so if we're looking at that 20 to 30 year old,
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.560]   a lot of times I really try to get them
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.840]   to focus on the whole movement aspect first.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.320]   So we phase them in, same with older women.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.600]   Phase them in, learn how to move, learn complex movements
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.040]   so that when you are going in to do resistance training,
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.600]   preferably three to four times a week,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.520]   you can look at moving well.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.640]   And it doesn't have to be a long period of time.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.200]   If you're doing to failure,
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   which works really well when you're younger
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.100]   to increase strength and a little bit of hypertrophy,
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.760]   you're gonna have to spend a little bit more time
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.600]   in the gym.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.780]   So it might be 45 to 60 minutes.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.960]   When we're looking at doing that four times a week,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.380]   you can add in a sprint interval training
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.280]   at the end of one of those
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.520]   to get that super high intensity,
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.120]   or you can look at putting in, at the most,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.880]   two HIIT sessions on separate days.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.060]   If you're training specifically for something,
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.240]   so if I work with a lot of endurance athletes still,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.640]   and they're like, "Well, how do I fit it in?"
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.180]   It's like, okay, well, we look at the quality
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.240]   and how that fits into your training.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.320]   So if you're training for a marathon,
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.680]   you're training for a triathlon or other endurance stuff,
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.280]   you can take that high intensity work
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.960]   and put it into your training program.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.820]   So ideally, we look at three to four resistance training
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.440]   with really good movement when we're in the younger set
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.840]   with two high intensities.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.920]   When we start getting into our 30s,
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.960]   we start having an eye to how are we actually doing
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.120]   that resistance training.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.160]   Instead of just going and doing a circuit,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.320]   we're really focusing on let's do some compound movements,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.400]   let's look at doing some heavier work,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.640]   let's look at how we are periodizing.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.880]   So we're having six week blocks
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.960]   and we're building on those blocks
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.120]   because we want that base foundation.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.280]   So when we get to be 40 plus,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.480]   we can actually go and do our power base training.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.960]   If you're in your 40s,
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.600]   you've never done resistance training at all,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   then we take between two weeks to four months
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.760]   to really learn how to move well
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.880]   because there's a higher incidence of soft tissue injury
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.400]   and overall injury as we get into our 40s
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.680]   because of perturbations of estrogen.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.240]   And ideally, when we get there,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.360]   we're looking at that around three minimum,
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.080]   three resistance training with compound movements
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.000]   and either one sprint interval
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.200]   or two sprint intervals and one hit in a week.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.800]   - And just to remind people, compound movements,
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.080]   multi-joint movements, squats, deadlifts, chin-ups, rows,
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.440]   overhead presses, bench presses, et cetera,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.940]   as opposed to isolation movements
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.960]   where only one joint is moving.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.800]   - Yeah.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.760]   - And for everybody in all those age ranges
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.800]   that you describe,
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.560]   are you suggesting they train the same muscle groups
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.880]   three or four times per week,
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.200]   or they do some sort of split where it's upper body,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.720]   lower body, take a day off,
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.040]   or upper body, take a day off,
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   lower body, take a day off,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.800]   whatever might work for them.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.120]   - Yeah, what works for them.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.660]   If you're looking for short amount of time in the gym
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.380]   because of busy lives and you can split it,
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.560]   if you're looking at, okay,
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.480]   well, I can allocate an hour to an hour and a half
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.520]   in the gym, then you can do total body with adequate rest.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.840]   The key when you're younger is working to failure.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.200]   The key when you're older is working heavy.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.320]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.040]   So when we're looking at working to failure,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.100]   we're trying to get more of that lean mass growth
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.400]   with strength.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.280]   When we get older,
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.320]   because it's so difficult to put on lean mass,
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.000]   we really want to focus on the strength component
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.400]   because that becomes more important
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.480]   when we're talking about longevity.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.360]   'Cause if you're looking at the strength component
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.460]   from a central nervous system standpoint,
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.720]   we see it feeds forward into better proprioception,
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.720]   attenuation of cognitive decline.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.320]   And this is the other thing that you in neuroscience
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.240]   would understand the sex differences
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.600]   in things like dementia and Alzheimer's.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.240]   There's some really interesting research
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.800]   looking at strength training and that power-based stuff.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.100]   When we're getting into our older ages,
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.520]   because we get more neural growth patterns
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.200]   and more neural pathways.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.660]   - Even some interesting literature
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.440]   about emphasizing some unilateral movements
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.520]   as people get older, not just dual limb movements
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.120]   or dual limb simultaneous movements.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.160]   You always want to train both sides of your body, folks.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.800]   But so if I understand correctly,
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.160]   younger women should train to failure,
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.840]   try and generate strength and hypertrophy.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.760]   As women get older,
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.840]   they should emphasize more strength training,
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.420]   leave some repetitions in reserve, but train heavier.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.620]   It makes so much sense what you're saying.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:50.040]   Because what we know about the nervous system as we age
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.320]   is that there's some atrophy
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.240]   or at least some weakening of neuromuscular connections
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.800]   and the upper motor neurons in the brain
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.160]   that control the neuromuscular connections
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.000]   in the spinal cord out to the muscle.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.520]   There's something really sticky about this idea
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.480]   in terms of longevity
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.520]   that I don't think anyone else has ever said.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.940]   - No, the thing about it is men age more in a linear fashion,
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.080]   whereas women, we have a definitive point
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.640]   in our late 40s, early 50s,
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.520]   where all of a sudden things go to shit,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.800]   where it's that perimenopausal state.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.600]   And I can't tell you how many emails and DMs I get in a day
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.760]   from women who are like, "I'm 46," or, "I'm 47.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.960]   "I'm putting on body fat.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.000]   "I don't know what's going on.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.040]   "I can't sleep."
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.800]   And then we say, "It's perimenopause."
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.040]   Like, what is that?
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.440]   And so when we're looking at perimenopause,
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.680]   it is a huge change in the body
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.080]   because you're having less and less
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.000]   of your sex hormones circulating.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.880]   More and more anovulatory cycles
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.940]   means no progesterone or very low progesterone.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.240]   You're having a difference in the pulse of your estradiol
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.200]   to those flatline aspects.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.400]   And because every system in the body is affected by it,
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.420]   this is why you see more soft tissue injuries.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.880]   Like, two of the biggest things that women
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.920]   who are in their 40s are going to PTs about
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.080]   are frozen shoulder and plantar fascia.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.720]   These are two really indicative issues
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.920]   that are happening in perimenopause.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.920]   So that whole section of mid-40s to early 50s
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.600]   is a definitive aging point
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.560]   where I really tried to get women
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.920]   to get into the heavy lifting
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:28.240]   and get into the patterns of polarizing their training,
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.680]   not putting an emphasis on zone two,
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.040]   just really looking at how am I polarizing,
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.880]   how am I affecting my central nervous system,
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.960]   so that when they get into that one point in time
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.640]   of that perimenopause,
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.440]   their body is already conditioned
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.680]   for the stress that's coming.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.920]   Whereas men, we see that kind of stuff
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.760]   happens in their late 50s, early 60s.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.000]   So the soft tissue injuries,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.520]   the change in body comp comes at a later time.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.320]   So yes, looking at how we're scoping our strength training,
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.800]   definitely something to think about in a longevity factor.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.840]   But for women, there's a better indication
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.440]   of the timing across the ages
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.360]   of when you should start implementing.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.840]   For men, I think you have a better bandwidth
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.740]   of when you should start implementing.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:19.600]   - For women who are not on hormone replacement therapy,
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.760]   and we did a previous episode about perimenopause, menopause
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.960]   and hormone replacement therapy,
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.400]   but if it comes up again and again today,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.240]   that would be wonderful
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   because these are important under-discussed topics.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.340]   - For women that are not on hormone replacement therapy,
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.960]   who decide to train heavier,
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.600]   maybe do a bit more training volume, not train to failure,
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.320]   they're making sure to not let their cortisol
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.560]   spike too much by making sure
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.240]   they have some pre-workout nutrition,
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.860]   some post-workout nutrition.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:52.400]   Would they be wise to be very careful
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.600]   in how much cardiovascular exercise they add to that?
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.520]   Meaning there seems to always be this risk of overtraining.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.480]   And as you pointed out, for various reasons,
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.460]   cultural reasons, historical reasons around exercise,
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.560]   my observation is that most women sort of,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.680]   unless they know better,
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.720]   default to cardiovascular exercise
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.060]   as opposed to resistance training.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.720]   So if a woman in her 40s, late 30s to,
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.680]   let's say 50, is doing two to four sessions
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.000]   of resistance training workouts per week,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.520]   and they also really like cardio
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.920]   or they feel they want to or should do cardio,
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.000]   should they be careful about how much cardio they're doing?
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.800]   And is there a best form of cardio?
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.240]   Should they really emphasize
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.640]   the high-intensity interval training?
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.760]   Should they avoid zone two?
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.280]   We should probably also divine for people what zone two is
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.780]   if they don't already know.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.920]   - So I am notorious for slamming things
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.160]   like Orange Theory and F45
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.560]   because they market specifically to that age group of women,
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.920]   and it's not appropriate
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.200]   because it's not true high-intensity work.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.680]   When we're looking at women who are really trying
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.480]   to maximize body composition change and longevity,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.400]   and unfortunately default to cardio 'cause they think,
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.520]   oh, that's gonna help change my body composition,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.240]   it's gonna help me lose body fat, it doesn't.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.320]   - Is this things like soul cycle as well?
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.480]   Okay, I've never done any of these,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.360]   but I imagine there's a lot of spinning,
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.640]   a lot of moving, a lot of sweating,
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.560]   and a lot of "calories burned" emphasis.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.960]   - Yes, there is.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.020]   But it puts women squarely in moderate intensity
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.600]   where they're so used to leaving one of those classes
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.080]   feeling absolutely smashed that when you tell them,
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.760]   actually that training doesn't work for you
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.800]   because it's putting you in a state of intensity
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.200]   that drives cortisol up,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.440]   but it's not a strong enough stress
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.200]   to invoke the post-exercise growth hormone
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.000]   and testosterone responses that we want
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.360]   to dampen that cortisol.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   So this is why we have that hyperbole
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.400]   of women who are in their 40s plus
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.320]   shouldn't do high-intensity work.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.800]   It's like, well, actually,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.440]   they shouldn't do moderate intensity.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.440]   They need to avoid that.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.280]   Polarizing, absolutely.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.120]   That's what we want.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.040]   We want true high-intensity work,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.380]   which is one to four minutes of 80% or more,
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.120]   or if you're doing sprint interval,
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.040]   it's full gas for 30 seconds or less.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.320]   And you're doing that a couple of times a week.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.880]   You're not doing it every day
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.440]   because you need to have enough recovery
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.520]   to hit those intensities truly
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.000]   because those are the intensities
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.600]   that are gonna give you those post-exercise
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.740]   hormonal responses to drop cortisol.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.000]   When we're looking at women who are like,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.680]   oh, well, I love going out for hours and hours on my bike
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.320]   and I love doing my spin classes.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.920]   It's like, okay, but we need to look at the big rock here.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.240]   If you are looking for longevity and body composition change
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.400]   and cognition and all those things,
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.920]   you have to polarize your training
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.900]   and that has to be the focus.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.120]   But soul food, I come from a long background of endurance.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.080]   I now love riding my gravel bike on the weekends
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.720]   for long periods of time, which is not optimal for me,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.560]   my age, that kind of stuff for all the things
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.820]   that I want to see improvements in.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.640]   But mentally, it's great.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.440]   So when we talk about going out for that long stuff,
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.040]   zone two is at low conversation
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.680]   and that's fine for mental health and being out in nature.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.440]   But for optimal health and wellbeing,
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.900]   we don't wanna do that.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.500]   We want to look at resistance training as a bedrock
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.780]   and true high intensity work
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.960]   to help with body composition change, metabolic control,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.720]   insulin sensitivity, brain health
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.120]   and dropping that cortisol.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:47.980]   - I have family members who are women who are thin
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.540]   because they love to walk and they just walk a ton
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:56.600]   and they eat well and enough,
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.260]   but they are resistant to resistance training.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.880]   And if they do pick up a weight,
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.200]   it's usually some very light dumbbells, do a few curls,
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.780]   a couple of tricep extensions
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   and aren't really leaning into the higher intensity work.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.920]   I think this is pretty common.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.400]   And my observation is that it's common,
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.720]   not because they couldn't be incentivized
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.180]   to do the higher intensity work,
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.160]   but that learning the complex compound movements,
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:32.000]   like how to squat properly or even leg press properly,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.800]   deadlift properly can be a bit overwhelming,
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.400]   especially when one walks into a gym.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   This is true for men too.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.000]   Like all this stuff, all this equipment,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.680]   all these bodies and these people look like
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.520]   they know what they're doing.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.480]   It's like if I were to go into an advanced
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.000]   like kitchen or symphony and all these instruments,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.560]   I don't know how to play.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.080]   So what's the best line of attack for somebody
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.840]   who really wants to overcome this longevity barrier?
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.320]   Because clearly resistance training,
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.880]   proper nutrition work.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.760]   And the cardiovascular exercise piece
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.960]   is a little bit more intuitive.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.320]   Walking, you do it faster.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.480]   You're jogging, you do it faster.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.880]   You're running.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.440]   The bike, the soul cycle class, et cetera.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.600]   It's just, it's easier in terms of the mechanics.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.760]   One can still get hurt, but it's just more straightforward.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.160]   Is there a way that in the absence of a budget
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.300]   for a personal trainer that somebody can learn
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.720]   how to do these movements and as you said,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.540]   ease into them over the course of even up to four months
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.840]   in a way that they can be confident
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.320]   that they're unlikely to get hurt
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.640]   and really build up their capacity to do real work
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.960]   that can benefit them?
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.120]   - Yeah, this is where I love technology for one thing.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.240]   But if we're staying really basic,
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.920]   I look at some of my family members
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.440]   and I've gotten them started with just body weight stuff
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.200]   or loading a backpack with cans
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.960]   to add a little bit of resistance.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.860]   So they feel comfortable in their own house
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.800]   and they might be doing lunges or squats,
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.240]   just keying them up of like where foot placement
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.440]   and knee and that kind of stuff.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.840]   So they're getting used to that kind of movement.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.240]   I love Kelly Starrett's stuff with mobility.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.880]   So show them like, here's how we do some of the mobility
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.040]   to find where the sticking points are.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.000]   And then you can either direct them to some of the programs
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.900]   that are out there that like Haley Happens
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.160]   has some really good ones for women who are 40 plus.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   So does Brie and then Sunny Webster down in Australia.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.900]   You can send in a video of what you're doing
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.720]   and he can critique you and tell you things to do.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.640]   There are other programs like that too.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.800]   So there's lots of ways of getting help if you seek it.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.880]   The personal trainer is very much a stumbling block
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.100]   for a lot of people.
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.880]   And as much as I am not a fan of Planet Fitness,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.180]   I am a fan of the fact that they've made it really easy
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.480]   for someone to walk in
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.600]   who's interested in resistance training.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.320]   And they can go to a circuit,
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.720]   one of the circuit things that they have at the back,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.440]   and they can start resistance training on machines,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.660]   which is another level up to learning compound movements.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.680]   So there's lots of ways of breaking that barrier to entry.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   You just have to find the motivation factor
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   of what's gonna incentivize the person
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.560]   to give up their time walking every day
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.840]   and taking time to go to the gym
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.520]   or taking time to do garage-based stuff
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.760]   that's going to improve their lean mass.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.840]   - I'm a big fan of machines,
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.200]   especially plate-loaded machines,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   but machines just create the close to correct
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.360]   or correct arc of movement.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.400]   - Yeah, for your size.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.640]   And to really spend the time adjusting the seat height,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.800]   adjusting the various pins on the machine,
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.800]   not just the weight,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.880]   in order to make sure that one gets the best range of motion.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.760]   I think this is something small,
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.800]   but that is significant in terms of its impact.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.200]   People just plop down in a machine,
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   especially if you're working in with somebody,
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.680]   and feel, especially beginners,
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.920]   will feel pressure to move quickly,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.360]   and they won't adjust the seat height.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.080]   And so it's just all wrong for them.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.920]   And all it takes is a little bit of time to,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.880]   you know, and ask people how to adjust the machines.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.480]   - I'm also a fan of kettlebells in the garage
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.400]   or lighter dumbbells that you can do,
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.480]   like thrusters or hang cleans or something like that
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.680]   to get the momentum and movement feeling,
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.280]   'cause that's another good learning curve for people.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.120]   So like I said, there's lots of ways
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.000]   that you can implement things
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.960]   based on someone's intuitive like
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.080]   or dislike of resistance training.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.040]   - So you've mentioned polarized training.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.080]   If I understand correctly,
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.280]   this would be a woman doing three or four days
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.520]   of high intensity resistance training
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.520]   for 45 to 60 or 45 to 75 minutes per session.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.360]   And then at the opposite extreme,
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.440]   maybe just walking a lot or jogging a lot.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.400]   So is that what you're talking about,
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.760]   polarized training as opposed to
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.080]   these other forms of training
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.800]   where it's designed to get people sweating like crazy,
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.600]   breathing hard for long periods of time,
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   but neither putting them in the landscape
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.840]   of inducing muscle strength adaptations
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.120]   and hypertrophy adaptations,
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.760]   nor really taxing the cardiovascular system enough
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:21.200]   to create an increase in longevity, for instance?
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.440]   - When I talk about polarizing,
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.560]   I look at the high intensity strength,
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.440]   like that's really hard on the central nervous system.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.040]   And then we look from a cardiovascular standpoint
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.320]   of doing true high intensity work.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.600]   So the walking is more of the recovery.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.160]   So if you're going to go out and do something long,
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.280]   it has to be very, very easy.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.480]   If you are looking at cardiovascular
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.120]   and you want that big sweat,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.440]   then we are talking true sprint interval training.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.320]   So what I have a lot of women do
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.760]   is a 20 minute lower body heavy set.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.480]   And then they'll go on the assault bike
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.120]   and do as hard as they can for 30 seconds,
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.280]   and then recover as much as they need to,
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.000]   to go then do another 30 seconds as hard as they can.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.360]   Most people go, "Oh, I can do four or five of those."
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.320]   After two, they're completely gassed
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.920]   because it's that hard of work.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.960]   And that's what I mean by polarizing.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.640]   You have very, very low intensity for recovery
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.880]   and super, super high intensity for metabolic
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.160]   and cardiovascular changes is what we're after.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.880]   - I'd like to take a quick break to let you know
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   that the Huberman Lab team has launched a new podcast
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.120]   with host Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.400]   Andy is an expert in exercise science and human performance
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.000]   and has long been a fan favorite
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.880]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.600]   This new podcast is called Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.000]   And it dives into topics
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.200]   such as how to build muscle and strength,
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.400]   how to improve your cardiovascular health
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.440]   and how to optimize recovery and sleep
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.560]   for performance and much more.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.120]   Andy is an absolutely fantastic educator
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.040]   and true expert on all things human performance.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.200]   I know you'll thoroughly enjoy his new podcast
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.840]   and learn a ton of useful knowledge from it.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.400]   So please check it out and give it a subscribe
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.160]   wherever you're watching or listening to podcasts now.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.560]   Again, the podcast is called Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.520]   Let's talk about the menstrual cycle
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.400]   and how that impacts training
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.600]   at the level of psychology and physiology.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.720]   Meaning, and of course the two are linked.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.120]   They're inextricably linked.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.840]   For instance, is there a particular phase
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.560]   of the menstrual cycle where a woman should expect
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.960]   that motivation and or recovery would be more challenging?
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.240]   - So this is the sticky point of recent science
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.480]   because we see all of these research studies
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.960]   and meta-analyses that are coming out
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.640]   of the sports science literature saying
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.160]   that there is no effect of the menstrual cycle on anything.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.680]   When you look at that population,
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.880]   it is specifically eumenorrheic women
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.440]   might have a subject pool of 10, if you're lucky, 12.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.320]   - So this is women who have quote unquote
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.400]   normal menstrual cycles, eumenorrheic.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.280]   - Supposedly ovulating.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.800]   So they have a definitive low hormone and high hormone phase.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.320]   - And this is probably because these studies
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.520]   are being done on university campuses
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.200]   with college undergraduate women.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.240]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.880]   - Which typically is in a given age range.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.160]   - Right. - Okay.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.680]   - And they look at performance,
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.440]   meaning that one point in time.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.000]   And we know that psychologically you can perform
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.200]   at any point in the menstrual cycle
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.760]   unless you have something like heavy menstrual bleeding.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.880]   When we're looking at a higher touch
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.920]   and looking not only from a molecular aspect,
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.040]   but also pulling in mixed methods
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.960]   and looking at the qualitative,
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.320]   we need women to track their own cycle
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.040]   and find their own patterns.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.400]   Because we know that there are times
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.120]   where you feel like crap and you can't push intensity.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.440]   But that might be on day eight for one woman,
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.120]   it might be day 18 for another.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.920]   From a molecular standpoint,
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.880]   we know that the low hormone phase being day one
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.440]   is the first day of bleeding up through ovulation,
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.280]   which is midway through your cycle.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.160]   You have a greater capacity for pulling in
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.480]   and accommodating stress, physical and mental stress.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.520]   So if we're looking at doing heavier loads,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.880]   we're looking at doing high intensity work,
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.680]   we're looking at motivation,
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.840]   then that low hormone phase is really optimal
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.880]   for trying to hit a PR or trying to hit a new speed
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.720]   'cause you can take on that stress
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.200]   and your immune system handles it,
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.160]   your muscles handle it, your core temperature,
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.760]   everything handles it.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   - So for most women in the weeks before their period,
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.800]   they're going to feel more robust
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.520]   except right up until the point of menstruation
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.200]   or the inverse.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.640]   - It is day one of bleeding up through mid cycle
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.480]   that could feel great.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.280]   The sticky point comes, not every woman ovulates.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.840]   And this is a thing when we're looking at general pop,
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.600]   we have lifestyle stress, we have nutrition stress,
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.880]   we know that women, for the most part,
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.200]   have four to five anovulatory cycles a year.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.480]   So this is where,
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.480]   when you're looking at that high hormone phase,
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.200]   we can't say you're definitively in the high hormone phase.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.960]   So this is where we need women to track their own cycles
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.880]   and understand their own patterns.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.480]   Because in an ideal world,
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.320]   we know that in the luteal phase,
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.840]   this is where we have the most change,
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.200]   where we have a pro-inflammatory response
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.920]   from the immune system.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.600]   We have inability to access carbohydrate as well.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.640]   We have a higher sympathetic drive.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.200]   So there's lots of things in there
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.760]   that aren't so fantastic for accommodating stress.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.720]   - So broadly speaking,
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.320]   the luteal phase is associated with more cortisol,
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.760]   more kind of baseline levels of stress.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.080]   Would it make sense for a woman
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.480]   to try and offset some of that
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.840]   with a bit more nutrition during that phase,
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.960]   a bit more perhaps complex carbohydrate?
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.760]   We know that some complex carbohydrate
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.720]   can blunt some of the cortisol response,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.400]   maybe just even a little bit more attention to eating.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.120]   I mean, core temperature goes up,
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.400]   but the whole goal of the luteal phase is to build tissue.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.120]   So this is where we're seeing a lot of shuttling
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.000]   of carbohydrate and amino acids
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.960]   to go to build that endometrial lining.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.120]   And that's the whole goal.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.000]   So yes, you need to eat more protein.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.680]   You need to eat more carbohydrate.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.440]   But again, the sticking point is, did you ovulate or not?
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.440]   So if you aren't aware of if you ovulated or not,
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.360]   you're tracking your own patterns,
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.480]   then just be acutely aware
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.360]   that in about the week before your next period comes,
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.440]   you really need to be amping up carbohydrate and protein.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.240]   'Cause that's gonna help you hit intensities.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.280]   It's gonna kind of level that playing field,
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.840]   especially on days where you feel
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.560]   like you can really hit those intensities, you feel great,
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.880]   but then you go to do something
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.800]   and your heart rate's higher than it should be.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.440]   You don't feel that you can hit those.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.280]   If you're offsetting it with some increased carbohydrate
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.480]   beforehand, you're gonna hit it.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.200]   So it's, again, it's really dialing it back down
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.480]   to the individual now
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.920]   because we don't have enough robust research
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   to make generalized ideas
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.800]   because of the nuance of, have you ovulated or not?
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.320]   What are your ratios of estrogen and progesterone
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.360]   in that luteal phase?
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.720]   So when we bring it back down to the general pop,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.320]   it's like the best thing to do
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.640]   is to track your menstrual cycle over sleep,
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.080]   over how you're feeling, find your own patterns
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.440]   and dial in your training in your days
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.200]   according to what your pattern is.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.440]   - How hard should a woman push through the mental
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.600]   and maybe even physical resistance to train less
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.760]   or not train during a given phase of the cycle?
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.160]   - It depends on how she feels.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.000]   What we can't rely on are things like heart rate variability
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.120]   'cause we know that changes
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.880]   with the autonomic nervous system change of progesterone.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.440]   It's a good indication that you've ovulated
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.240]   'cause your heart rate variability tanks,
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.120]   but it's not a good indication of what your body can do.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.640]   If you wake up, I always say it's a 10 minute rule.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.560]   You wake up and you feel awful.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.560]   And you're like, I really wanna do this workout,
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.960]   but I don't know how it's gonna go.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.320]   Give yourself 10 minutes.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.640]   If after 10 minutes, you can't hit those intensities
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.720]   or you just feel horrible, change it, drop it down,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.680]   do something that's more recovery,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.720]   do something that's not gonna be so taxing
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.640]   because we do have a limited amount of that stress acumen
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.880]   of how much stress we can handle.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.680]   So if you're gonna try to exert it all
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.200]   in a high intensity workout,
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.520]   what do you have left over for the rest of the day?
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.920]   And then that compounds
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.160]   because if you're always fighting it,
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.360]   then you're going to increase this baseline sympathetic drive
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.240]   because you're fighting the training, you're fighting life.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.440]   So give yourself that 10 minute rule.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.600]   If it happens three days in a row, that's okay
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.140]   'cause it's a very short period of time.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.820]   It's not gonna last forever.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:51.780]   So a lot of women have this internal conversation
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.840]   of I have to do this.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.540]   And it's really based on some kind of external,
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.360]   they think everyone's watching them.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.400]   But internally, you don't have to.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   If you give yourself permission, you end up training better,
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.280]   recovering better and getting better gains.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.340]   - On the flip side,
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:11.600]   if a woman is feeling spectacularly good,
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.560]   should she just really push it as hard as she can
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.180]   or is there anything about the relationship
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.860]   between the hormone fluctuations of the menstrual cycle
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.860]   and feeling really, really great
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.620]   that training hard can somehow disrupt the cycle?
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.220]   And this is actually kind of the old lore,
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.300]   probably myth, I would imagine,
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.840]   that high intensity resistance training
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.280]   is somehow detrimental to female hormone cycles.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.820]   I don't think there's any evidence for that,
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:43.460]   but I hear that from time to time.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.620]   Why do you think that myth came to be?
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.880]   Why do you think it propagates
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.520]   and what can we do to extinguish it
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.720]   if in fact it's not true?
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.780]   - It's not true.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.520]   We see it comes from a misstep in food intake.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.400]   And we also see that it's a cultural influence.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.480]   Because if we think about how sports started,
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.400]   it started as a way for men to demonstrate
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.440]   how powerful and aggressive they are.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.120]   And this is the original Olympics, right?
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.320]   There were no women allowed.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.800]   And as we feed forward into sport
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.540]   and how it became okay for women to be involved,
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.640]   at the high performance level,
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.900]   if a woman walks in and shows any fallibility,
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.940]   then she's immediately put on a lower stool, right?
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.020]   You know, you can't play with the boys
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.940]   because you have a menstrual cycle.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:25.780]   You're bleeding.
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.600]   You're a woman.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.000]   You're a delicate flower.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.580]   So women would walk into that professional sports space
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.420]   and be excited if they were amenorrheic
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.860]   or didn't have periods.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.260]   Or they trained hard enough and their period went away
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.860]   because then they were more like men
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.060]   and they could play with the boys.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.740]   If you start bringing up menstrual cycle
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.060]   in professional sport,
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.520]   now as of the past about four or five years,
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.760]   it's okay to talk about it,
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.620]   which is, you know what, 2020.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:54.060]   So that myth of high intensity resistance training
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.460]   causing issues with the menstrual cycle,
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.880]   one, it's a cultural nuance for pushback
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.100]   against women being in that space.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.860]   But then the reality is women weren't eating enough
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.680]   to accommodate for that stress,
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.320]   which then feeds forward to low energy availability,
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.520]   maybe relative energy deficiency in sport,
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.840]   perturbations in all of our menstrual cycle hormones.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.000]   So it's not the act
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.560]   of the high intensity resistance training.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.400]   It's the act of not fueling appropriately for it
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.400]   and then getting the okay to not have your period
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.080]   because yeah, now you're in with,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.140]   you're training hard enough.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:31.980]   You've lost it.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.880]   You're more like a man.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.320]   - Wow, very interesting history there.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.360]   Is it true then that if a woman maintains
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.640]   either caloric balance with her basically eating enough
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.760]   to support her energy output
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.780]   or even a slight caloric surplus,
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.080]   that it's unlikely that her periods will cease
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.000]   even if she's training very hard and very often?
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.380]   - Correct.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:02.040]   - So it basically boils down to calories in, calories out.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.080]   Fuel for the task at hand
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.520]   because some people want to have a slight calorie deficit
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.200]   even in high training.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.920]   And if that deficit is at night away from training,
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.400]   maybe 150 to 200 calories,
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.420]   then it's gonna help perpetuate body fat loss,
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.720]   not lean mass loss,
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.480]   and it's not gonna interfere with recovery.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.720]   It's the fueling in and around the stress,
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.120]   meaning the exercise stress, it's really important,
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.560]   but women have been so conditioned to not eat
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.360]   and not take up space, to be small.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.940]   All of these sociocultural things
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.680]   that women are afraid to admit the fact
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.120]   that they want to eat and they should be eating.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.340]   So this is a nuance within the fitness community
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.440]   that we're really trying to change
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.640]   and get the mindset around you train hard, you eat well,
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.160]   and your body responds in kind.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.880]   - Appetite, body temperature,
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.120]   and hormones are very tightly linked.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.040]   - Yes, they are.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.840]   - Far too tightly for us to disentangle all of those
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.560]   in a single conversation here.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.400]   But as you're describing the urgent need
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.360]   for women to fuel enough with the proper fuels,
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.720]   to train hard enough,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.320]   to stimulate the correct adaptations that they need,
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:20.280]   I imagine that the shift in appetite and body temperature
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.840]   that occurs across the menstrual cycle
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.240]   is also gonna play into this,
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.400]   meaning there will be phases of the menstrual cycle
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.240]   where women will be just naturally less motivated
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.000]   to eat enough carbohydrate, enough protein,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.200]   in order to get the most out of their training.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.960]   What phases of the menstrual cycle are those
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.720]   so that women can pay particular attention
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.800]   to make sure that they're fueling enough?
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.760]   - Yeah, as estrogen starts to come up
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.280]   right before ovulation,
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.560]   that estrogen surge really dampens appetite.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.480]   It also has an interplay with our appetite hormones,
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.680]   which is part of the reason
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.160]   why we don't have that great of an appetite.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.080]   It holds after ovulation.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.080]   Estrogen dips, you get hungry, it comes up,
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.320]   and people are like, I have some cravings
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.960]   which are driven by progesterone
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.720]   'cause your body needs more calories.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.600]   But at the same time, with the elevation of estrogen,
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.320]   you're not hungry.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.360]   You have cravings, but you're not hungry.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.640]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.880]   So it's trying to disconnect those.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.440]   It's like your appetite is something that will come back,
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.920]   of course, once you eat.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.640]   But cravings are more of that psychological capacity
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.200]   of, yeah, my body needs more, but I'm not quite sure what.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.240]   So to get women to understand
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.920]   what's happening across the board,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.800]   it's always coming back to,
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.240]   let's fuel appropriately for the exercise.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.640]   And even if you're not hungry,
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.000]   if you are fueling appropriately at that point in time,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.440]   if you end up with less,
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.400]   at least you've stopped that breakdown state,
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.440]   that catabolic state.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.480]   So we don't get those perturbations in the hypothalamus.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.720]   That's my biggest concern for women,
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.920]   is really taking care of that signaling from the brain
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.480]   to the rest of the body.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.400]   And if we have fuel on board,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.400]   even though we have appetite perturbations,
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.800]   and if you go do a really hard workout in the heat,
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.400]   you're not gonna be hungry either.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.720]   But if you're having a cold protein drink
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.600]   after that hot workout,
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.480]   you're taking care of that immediate need
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.680]   to shut down the signals that we need to break down things.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.480]   - Let's talk about one of the many third rails
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.400]   of discussions online, which is birth control.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.680]   - Yeah.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.400]   - And we need to define exactly
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.840]   what type of birth control we're talking about,
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.440]   because there are so many different forms.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.360]   - Yes.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.320]   - There are IUDs, there are the copper IUDs,
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.880]   there's the ring, there's the, you know.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.240]   Let's talk about oral contraceptives
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   that are designed to prevent ovulation.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.160]   So this is, quote unquote, the pill.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.840]   So we're being, let's for now limit the conversation to that
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.240]   so that there isn't confusion.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.160]   Share with us, if you will, your thoughts on these,
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.640]   how they impact any of the things that we're talking about,
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.760]   or anything else from that, for that matter.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.080]   - Can we have another history lesson?
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:04.920]   - Please.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.760]   - All right.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.440]   I just gave a talk at home
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.600]   to some young athletes on contraception,
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.800]   because someone might be on the depot,
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.600]   and if they're on it for more than two years,
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.800]   they get bone mineral density loss.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.200]   So then the question of, okay,
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.560]   well, how does the oral contraceptive pill come up?
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.280]   How does that affect things?
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.640]   It's like, well, let's look at the history of it.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.880]   Initially came from Stanford,
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.440]   was funded by Catherine McCormick from McCormick family,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.720]   and a feminist activist, Margaret Singer.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.800]   But because they are women, they couldn't get in the lab,
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.880]   so they got a guy from Stanford to develop the pill.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.160]   And he's like, you know what?
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.120]   We need to put in a placebo week
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.480]   so that women feel like they're having a bleed.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.000]   So if we're looking at the three active pills,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.600]   and then the one sugar pill week,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.440]   it was by design to make women feel
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.640]   like they are having control over their menstrual cycle,
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.400]   and they would still have a bleed.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.720]   But it's not a true bleed, it's a withdrawal bleed.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.760]   So this becomes the confusing point
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.920]   for people who are on an oral contraceptive pill.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.360]   They're like, I get my period.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.880]   It's like, no, you don't.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.520]   'Cause the idea of the hormones
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.200]   that are in an oral contraceptive pill
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.080]   is to down-regulate your ovarian function
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.000]   so that you don't ovulate.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.680]   So you have a whole different hormone profile
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.880]   from someone who naturally cycles.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.520]   So this depends on the type
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.560]   of oral contraceptive pill you're using.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.960]   For the most part, monophasic
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.280]   is the one that's most prescribed.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.520]   So that means the three weeks of the active pill
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.080]   is the same dose of estrogen and progesterone,
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.720]   and then you have your sugar pill week
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.800]   or your withdrawal week, and then you start again.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.960]   When we look at the repercussions
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   of using oral contraceptive pill in active women,
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.400]   there's a higher amount of inflammatory responses
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.520]   and oxidative responses.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.520]   So from a training standpoint, no one's done the study yet,
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.120]   but I would be interested in doing this,
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.680]   of looking at how that impacts adaptation.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.840]   You do end up with a new baseline of this
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.000]   when you start taking the pill,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.200]   but we're not really sure how that impacts adaptation.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.560]   We also look at the progestin component
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.120]   of the oral contraceptive pill,
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.240]   'cause we have four generations of progesterone.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.120]   First generation was really high dose
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.480]   and has a lot of risk factors,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.320]   not really prescribed that much.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.360]   Second generation is the most prescribed,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.880]   and this is the one that people just take,
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.920]   it's in your IUD, it's in your OC,
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.400]   has the least amount of side effects.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.120]   And then we have a third and a fourth generation.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.080]   The fourth generation is primarily used
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.840]   for women who have really bad PMS or PMDD,
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.440]   which is your premenstrual dysphoria disorder.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.640]   So significant mood issues,
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.560]   because that progestin has a direct effect
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.560]   on a lot of the dopamine receptors in the brain as well.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.960]   The third generation is very androgenic.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.920]   So we see that in some preliminary research,
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.160]   that improves speed and power
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.600]   by the second week of intake because it's accumulated.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.880]   So when we're looking directly
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.960]   at an oral contraceptive pill,
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.640]   we can't make generalizations
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.520]   because you have low dose, high dose estrogen.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.880]   We see that a 30 microgram dose increases hypertrophy,
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.240]   but not strength,
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.480]   'cause estrogen increases the satellite cell aspect.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.560]   So for my power and Olympic athletes,
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.880]   Olympic lifting athletes, that's a detriment
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.480]   because they'll put on muscle mass, but no strength.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.320]   So we've had to look at changing their OC
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.920]   or getting them off.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.040]   For women who have breakthrough bleeding,
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.400]   that higher incidence of,
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.680]   or that higher intake of estrogen is really beneficial.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.920]   So when we look overall at how it impacts women
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.920]   from an athletic standpoint,
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.320]   it's so variable in the hormone profile
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.880]   that we can't make generalizations.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.920]   We only look at the very high performance athletes
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.320]   and what's happening up there
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.880]   because that can make or break an athlete.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.480]   So from the general touch point, we don't know enough.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.080]   Like the beginning of this year, 2024,
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.360]   there was a study that came out looking at changes
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.960]   in the amygdala that happens with oral contraceptive use.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.640]   It's reversible in adults,
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.600]   but for young girls, we don't know
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.360]   because their brain is developing.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.200]   And unfortunately physicians will pass out OCs
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.160]   as if it's candy.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.000]   - OCs.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.440]   - Oral contraceptive. - Oral contraceptives.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.920]   And do you recall what the direction
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.760]   of the effect was on the amygdala?
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.560]   For those that don't recall
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.800]   the amygdala bilateral brain structure,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.560]   meaning one on each side of your brain,
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.040]   literally means almond in Latin, it's almond shaped.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.680]   And it's part of a larger network
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.440]   associated with threat detection.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.760]   Sometimes it's described the locus of fear in the brain,
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.840]   but it's involved in a lot of other things too,
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.560]   both positive valence and negative valence,
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.560]   but nonetheless is part of the threat detection system,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.360]   elevated levels of arousal,
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.400]   which is why it's often discussed
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   in the context of fear, anxiety, et cetera.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.600]   - It increased fear in women who are on the OC,
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.880]   oral contraceptive pill,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   made them less willing to take chances.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.000]   And when they went off it,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.040]   they're like, well, why couldn't I do that before?
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.800]   So that's why they started looking at the amygdala.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.960]   And when I say we're looking at young girls,
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.640]   and again, we don't know what's happening.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.600]   Is it reversible in young girls that are put on it or not
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.560]   because of the brain structure changes that are happening?
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.600]   So when we talk about an oral contraceptive pill,
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.960]   I want people to understand
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.000]   that it has a significant effect on the body,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.400]   not just reproductive.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.040]   We don't know enough about all the other effects.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.760]   So I have parents who say,
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.440]   my daughter wants to go on the oral contraceptive pill.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.000]   She's having irregular periods.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.320]   She's an athlete.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.280]   We wouldn't be able to control it.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.840]   And it's like, if there's a issue
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.240]   with your menstrual cycle now,
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.800]   it's still gonna be there when you get off it.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.480]   So we have to look and see what's going on here.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.600]   If you're looking to get on it
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.240]   to control your menstrual cycle, why?
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.480]   Because we know that you can have an increase
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.160]   in your VO2 max and other anaerobic capacity
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.720]   when you're not on it.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:17.080]   So you have a better top end capacity
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.360]   when you're not being blunted by these hormones.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.200]   And then the other conversation is,
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.160]   oh, my skin.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.040]   It's like, well, they have really good dermatologists
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.080]   that can help you with that.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.920]   You don't have to go on an oral contraceptive pill.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.920]   But unfortunately, GPs don't understand all of that.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.360]   And if a girl comes in and says,
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.040]   I'm having irregular cycles, heavy menstrual bleeding,
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.680]   I wanna go on the OC, here you go.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.240]   So it is a huge conversation still we had.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.240]   I put it in the same category as menopause hormone therapy
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.560]   'cause there isn't enough research
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.640]   to address all the population needs.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.520]   And we see these big pendulum switches.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.440]   So before it was like, everyone be on the OC.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.880]   And now it's like, maybe not.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.640]   And then it was no one be on menopause hormone therapy.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.080]   Everyone should be on it.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.480]   But we need to land in the middle
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.760]   and understand more of what's happening
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.520]   with these exogenous hormones.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.000]   - Is there any evidence that other forms
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.200]   of female contraception can be, let's just say problematic
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.520]   for the types of things we're discussing today?
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.120]   - Like the implant in the depot?
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.600]   - Or IUD, copper IUD?
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.720]   - Copper IUD and the Mirena
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.160]   or your progestin-laced IUD,
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:25.240]   those are what a lot of my tactical athletes will use
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.240]   'cause it doesn't have a systemic effect
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.240]   on adaptation or inflammation, mood, any of those things.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.640]   And it's a fit and forget.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.320]   So you can put it in for up to three to five years.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.040]   If you have a really heavy bleeding, it really dissipates
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.240]   because the whole idea of an IUD
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.120]   is that then the endometrial lining.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.520]   And so then you have autophagy
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.880]   that takes care of the endometrial lining.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.400]   So you don't necessarily have a bleed.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.760]   The copper IUD is different
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.600]   because you do have really heavy bleeding
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.160]   for the first three cycles, and then it attenuates.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.240]   - Before we got started today,
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:03.000]   you mentioned some very interesting pioneering studies
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   on evaluating menstrual blood itself as a window
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.880]   into some larger themes about what's going on
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.000]   physiologically, maybe even psychologically.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.760]   Now might be a good time to just touch into that.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.120]   We can always return to it again later,
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.760]   but let me just ask it more directly.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.400]   What are some things that can be measured directly
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   from menstrual blood that are informative for women?
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.760]   And it sounds like there's a new generation
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.560]   of at-home tests that might be interesting
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.720]   and informative for them to think about.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.520]   - Yeah, well, if you think about menstrual fluid,
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   everyone thinks about it as a discard product,
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.720]   but it's a very good indicator of what's happening
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.080]   from an endocrine standpoint,
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.000]   gives a really good indication of what's happening
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.280]   from an endometrial standpoint.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.640]   So if you're looking at all the cytokines and the proteins
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.040]   and the tissue that comes from it,
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:03.040]   it's a huge indicator that's naturally discharged
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:08.040]   that we're now looking at for determining HPV,
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.680]   do you have it or not?
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.440]   What about proteins for PCOS?
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.560]   Can we really identify PCOS or endometriosis?
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.960]   - We talk about PCOS for a moment.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.240]   Most people have heard of it by now,
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.440]   but polycystic ovarian syndrome,
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.880]   it's associated with typically elevated androgens.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.240]   It's becoming more and more common
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.680]   or perhaps detected more based on better detection methods.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.680]   I don't know which.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.800]   The prevalence of PCOS seems to be very, very high.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.920]   - It does, and I think it's a combination of both.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.600]   We also see some rebound PCOS that happens
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.560]   when someone gets off an oral contraceptive pill.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.960]   It's not necessarily true PCOS 'cause what's happening now,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.520]   your ovaries are producing eggs
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.680]   that have been downregulated for so long.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.760]   So under ultrasound, it might look like PCOS,
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.720]   but it's not necessarily true indication.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.800]   The other is more and more women are starting to eat more,
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.800]   and so they're coming out of low energy availability.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.040]   If you have more carbohydrate,
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.680]   you end up with greater follicular stimulation,
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.920]   which also shows up as PCOS.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.280]   So the true PCOS, yes, there is a high incidence
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.800]   from a reporting standpoint,
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.280]   but is it that rebound
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.600]   where it's not having all the androgenetic changes?
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.160]   That's still kind of up in the air at the moment,
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.160]   but it is a big concern for women
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.600]   because it is an indication that something's going on
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.560]   and they might have some fertility issues.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.360]   We see a really high incidence of PCOS
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.160]   in Olympic-level athletes
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.960]   because of the higher androgenetic aspect of PCOS,
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.040]   so better recovery time,
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.280]   a little bit higher baseline testosterone.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.720]   So yeah, it's a population specificity as well.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.480]   - In the '80s and '90s, there was a lot of excitement
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.360]   in the kind of neurobehavioral endocrinology fields,
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.560]   largely based on animal literature,
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.840]   but then expanding into human literature
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.240]   that certain forms of activities
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.640]   could change hormone patterns and maybe even psychology.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.400]   And that makes sense on the surface of it,
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.640]   but is there evidence that if somebody engages
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:19.960]   in say high-intensity training or competitive scenarios,
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.440]   this has been explored a lot in men,
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.640]   but I'm wondering if it's also been explored now in women,
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.240]   that androgens go up?
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.440]   I mean, there's been these studies,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.800]   I don't know how good they are,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.200]   of people on the stock exchange
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.040]   watching their stress fluctuations, measuring testosterone.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.600]   I think most of those studies were done in men,
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.640]   but other competitive scenarios,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:45.160]   even showing, for instance, that exogenous testosterone
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:49.140]   can increase altruism in men if men are competing
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:53.520]   for who's donating the most money at a philanthropic event.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.120]   But you put them in a different scenario
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.600]   where it's far less benevolent in goal,
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.960]   and then exogenous testosterone drives competitiveness
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.440]   towards things that are more traditionally thought of
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.640]   as male-male competition.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.840]   In other words, it's all context dependent.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.800]   Is there anything that kind of springs to mind
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.120]   of interesting studies as it relates to androgens
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.480]   or estrogens in women athletes,
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.200]   and as it relates to exercise?
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.880]   - They haven't done any specific studies like that in women.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.000]   We do see that under stress, the cortisol increases,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.400]   and if you have an adequate response to it
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.640]   and your body can overcome it,
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.880]   then yes, you get a boost in testosterone for women.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.700]   We see this in a lot of the night mission shift changes
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.460]   in tactical athletes.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:42.460]   There is also, I guess, a lessening of circulating estrogen
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:47.880]   so the pulse changes when we start getting to the end
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.500]   of a really strong training block,
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.360]   because we're starting to have a little bit
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   of a down regulation of our luteinizing hormone,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.580]   pulse, and estrogen.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.360]   But it shouldn't be severe enough
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.760]   to cause menstrual cycle dysfunction.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.300]   What we want people to do is look at the ratio
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.200]   of their estrogen, progesterone,
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.120]   and keeping track of luteinizing hormone
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.700]   if they're at that point where they are going
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.080]   to have a really big training block.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.480]   So we look at pre-season, during season, end of season,
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.960]   and people who might be at a higher risk factor
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.400]   for becoming amenorrheic, then we keep track that way.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.720]   Because it is the stress component that can down regulate,
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.080]   not actually causing a permanent change.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.320]   - As we talk about menstruation,
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.800]   we should probably talk about iron stores and iron.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.280]   - Yeah.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.240]   - Do women need to supplement iron,
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.200]   given that they lose iron during menstruation?
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.160]   - It's interesting because we have a change in hepcidin,
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.960]   or hepcidin, depending on which part
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.320]   of the world you come from.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.640]   Because it is increased under times of inflammation
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.800]   and decreased under times of iron loss.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.720]   So we see a significant change across the menstrual cycle.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.720]   So I tell women, if you are concerned with low ferritin,
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.400]   then we want you to take an iron supplement
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.000]   every other day, starting with the first day
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.120]   of your bleed for 10 days.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.280]   Because that's going to really allow your body
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.480]   to absorb it and stay on top of it.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.960]   After that, every other day, yeah,
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.920]   but you're not gonna be absorbing as much of it
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.120]   because hepcidin starts to come up after ovulation.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.240]   Again, you have a pro-inflammatory response,
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.400]   you have greater inflammation.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.960]   Do women blanket need to supplement?
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.360]   No, because we see fatigue isn't necessarily
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.960]   just iron related.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.680]   There's so many other reasons why women are fatigued.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.320]   The one problem is the baseline levels for like ferritin.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.040]   For active women, if you go in and you have a ferritin level
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.720]   of 20 to 25, they're gonna say it's normal.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.440]   But we'd rather see you up around 50.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.280]   So if you are in that low end of normal,
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.080]   then supplementing will help you get up into that 50
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.280]   and see if it makes a difference.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.920]   If a woman is going to get a blood test
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.120]   to evaluate testosterone, estrogen, lipids,
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.160]   metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.920]   and she can only afford to do that at one point
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.360]   during her cycle and compare at various times,
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.600]   maybe every six months, or once a year even,
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.160]   at that specific time of her cycle,
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.000]   is there a best time and cycle to do that blood test?
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.640]   If I'm limited to say that,
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.320]   then I would say five to seven days
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.840]   before her next period starts, so mid luteal,
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.800]   because then you can get a good indication
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.120]   of estrogen progesterone peak.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.960]   Testosterone doesn't fluctuate as much as those two,
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.240]   so you're gonna get a good idea
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.440]   what baseline testosterone is.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.960]   And we know that there's a greater inflammatory response,
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.080]   so anything that's outside of the norm
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.120]   of that upper elevation of inflammation,
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.840]   you're going to be able to pick out.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.880]   So yeah, I would say if you could only do it
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.840]   at one point in time, that would be the time to do it.
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.040]   - And if she can add a second blood test
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.120]   at a different phase of the menstrual cycle,
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.640]   where would you place that second test?
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   - Day two of the menstrual cycle, second day of bleeding,
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.400]   to get a really good indication
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.320]   of what your true estrogen level is at baseline.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.440]   - And if she measures her hormones
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.240]   at those two times within the cycle,
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.880]   do you think that's sufficient to get 75% plus
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.880]   of the relevant data?
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.360]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.200]   - Terrific.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.240]   Caffeine. - Yes.
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:38.360]   - In the old days, meaning when I was a kid,
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.480]   and not long ago, three weeks ago,
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.200]   we would hear these crazy statements about caffeine.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.880]   It pulls calcium out of the bones.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.240]   It's, you know, you'd hear this stuff.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.640]   I did a whole episode on caffeine.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.760]   I'm a big fan of caffeine,
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:56.440]   but I do warn people that if they suffer from anxiety
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:00.000]   or they're going through a particularly stressful life event,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.120]   it can raise the activity of the sympathetic arm
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.280]   or the autonomic nervous system.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.200]   You'll feel more nervous.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.560]   You're more prone to panic when you're drinking caffeine,
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.760]   but many people love caffeine.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:13.240]   I think 90% of the adult population of the world
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.880]   ingests some form of caffeine every single day.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.080]   - I'm in that 90%.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.600]   - Likewise, making it the most consumed drug worldwide.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.040]   - Is caffeine safe for women?
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.000]   I suspect, based on what you just said,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   that the answer will be yes,
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.720]   but are there case conditions
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.920]   where women should be cautious about their intake of caffeine
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.160]   independent of this anxiety thing?
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.000]   I mean, people probably shouldn't drink more caffeine
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.760]   than they can tolerate psychologically.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.640]   No one, male, female, young or old.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.840]   - Yeah, it's more of a genetic factor
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.240]   than it is a sex factor.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.960]   So, I mean, both men and women will be fast metabolizers,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.600]   slow metabolizers or not have an effect.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.040]   That becomes the bigger rock of them.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:02.520]   What we do find is in that perimenopausal state,
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.200]   women will become more sensitive
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.960]   to the blood sugar fluctuations that happen with caffeine.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.480]   So they're used to having coffee in the morning
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.600]   with something, then halfway through their workout,
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.200]   they become a little bit hypoglycemic
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   because there's changes in insulin sensitivity,
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.680]   insulin responses.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.440]   So there's changes also in blood sugar control
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.720]   and caffeine can exacerbate that.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.560]   So if you are someone who's like,
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:31.720]   oh, I always have a double espresso before I go workout
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.760]   and then halfway through, I'm really hypoglycemic.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.240]   I'm really dizzy and lightheaded.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.280]   I don't know what to do.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.360]   - Feel sick or nauseous.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.760]   - Eat some food.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.080]   Eat some food with it.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.680]   - What about sipping caffeine through the workout?
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.400]   You know, taking that coffee in
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.760]   and just having a sip between sets.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.520]   Can that offset some of that?
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.360]   - I don't think so.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.400]   - Okay.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.640]   I hear a lot that people who drink caffeine
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.600]   before a workout, you know, midway through,
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.760]   they're like, I don't feel good.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.520]   - 'Cause they don't eat.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.880]   - For me, that just stimulates the desire for more caffeine,
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.880]   but, or even, dare I say, a half piece of nicotine gum,
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.960]   which I experimented with, but I was told,
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.880]   and this is why I'm not going to continue to do it.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.580]   Not only is it very habit forming,
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.640]   it actually is such a vasoconstrictor
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.120]   that I was told by a dermatologist
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.240]   that it's terrible for skin,
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.920]   even if you're not getting your nicotine by smoking,
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.040]   vaping, dipping, or snuffing.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.400]   So this big trend now toward ingesting nicotine
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.480]   as a stimulant and cognitive enhancer
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.320]   and performance enhancer, I think people should
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:36.020]   at least be aware of the negative effects on skin.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:40.200]   - Never would have known 'cause I'm not a nicotine person.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.440]   - I'll tell you that half piece of nicotine gum
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.960]   is the first time you do it,
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:48.960]   it's an unbelievable experience.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:52.640]   It's like your first real cup of coffee.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.840]   - Oh, really wakes you up?
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.280]   - Yeah, and dials you in.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.220]   I recommend nobody do it because it feels that pleasant
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.400]   if you like caffeine.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.060]   - I like Shashandra for that reason.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:02.900]   - Shashandra?
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.720]   - Yeah.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.560]   - What's Shashandra?
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.400]   - It's an adaptogen.
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:06.220]   - Oh, I should know what this is.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:07.060]   - You should know what this is.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:07.900]   - I should know.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:08.720]   Well, I'm here to learn.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:10.120]   - Okay.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:10.960]   - Shashandra.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:15.960]   - Shashandra, yeah, so it is an adaptogenic plant.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.160]   So, you know, like ginseng, Siberian ginseng,
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:23.720]   maca, ashiganda, all those buzzwords out there.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.480]   Shashandra is another really well-studied adaptogen
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.640]   and I have friends who say it's like Adderall
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:32.720]   where you take it and it's immediate focus and function
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.120]   because its main goal is to regulate dopamine,
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.380]   serotonin and cortisol.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.940]   So it gives you, gets women and men out of that brain fog,
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:43.500]   gives them incredible focus.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.340]   - Do you use it?
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.160]   - Yep.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.140]   - Are you on it now?
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:47.500]   - I put it in my morning coffee.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.340]   - Okay.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:52.300]   You just sent people down the rabbit hole of the internet.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.140]   - The rabbit hole of Shashandra.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:53.960]   - Of the internet, all right.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:54.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.180]   - You heard it here first, Dr. Stacey Sims.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.360]   I'm gonna give it a try.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.300]   Because the nicotine thing is an interesting one
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.760]   and there are some cognitive enhancing effects of nicotine
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.580]   that perhaps in people 65 and older
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.380]   might actually be beneficial for offsetting
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.180]   some forms of neurodegeneration,
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.820]   but that needs to still be explored and researched.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.180]   Don't cut that and clip it and put it out there like so,
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.780]   that's happened already.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:17.620]   Very interesting.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.300]   All right, caffeine we both agree is great.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.540]   Shashandra.
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.380]   - You gotta try it.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.220]   - Check it out.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.040]   - Let me know.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:23.880]   - All right, will do.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.580]   Cold.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:26.400]   - Yeah.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.740]   - For reasons I still don't understand,
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.940]   people have associated me or this podcast
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.100]   with deliberate cold exposure.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.980]   I like deliberate cold exposure in the form of a cold shower
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:37.000]   or a cold plunge or an ice bath,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.900]   mostly for the effects that occur afterward,
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:44.780]   meaning more alertness, a kind of semi-euphoric buzz
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.100]   that goes on a long, long time.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.420]   No, I don't think it increases metabolism
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.740]   significantly enough to have a meaningful difference,
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:56.740]   but the long lasting increases in the so-called catecholamines
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:59.100]   dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.420]   to me are pretty impressive.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.280]   And I just like the way it makes me feel.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.200]   So that's the main reason I believe
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.040]   why people do deliberate cold exposure.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.340]   And every time I do a post about deliberate cold exposure,
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:14.160]   I get asked, understandably so,
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.880]   how does it affect women differently than men?
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.080]   And then I usually get questions about Raynaud's syndrome.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:19.920]   - Oh yeah.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.640]   - Yeah, so is there a difference
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.200]   in terms of how deliberate cold exposure impacts women?
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.560]   I have to imagine the answer is yes,
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.480]   given what you said earlier about vasoconstriction
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.800]   versus vasodilation, but deliberate cold exposure,
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.080]   like it, hate it.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:33.920]   What do you think?
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.600]   Do you recommend it for women?
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.920]   - I recommend it for open water swimmers
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.360]   who might experience that vagal response
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.520]   when they first dive into the cold.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.280]   I prefer heat for women.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.800]   Everyone's a responder to the heat.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.000]   You get better adaptations.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:48.960]   - So sauna?
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:49.800]   - Yep, sauna.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.880]   - Hot tub?
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.920]   - Yep, preferably a true finish sauna.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:56.200]   Infrared doesn't, it warms the skin, but not the core.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.120]   - Thank you for saying that.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.840]   I'm not a big fan of infrared sauna
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.000]   because it doesn't get hot enough.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:00.840]   - No.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.320]   You can bring an infrared light into a traditional sauna
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.680]   if it can tolerate the heat.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.000]   But finish sauna would be what?
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.320]   Something between 185 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.320]   and maybe 210 if you're really heat adapted.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.840]   - Yeah, I'm still working on metric.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.960]   Let me do the conversion.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.800]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:16.640]   Yeah, you're living down in New Zealand now.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.080]   - Yeah, so 60 to 80 degrees C.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:19.920]   - I need to look.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.520]   Every time I've tried to do math on the fly
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.360]   on this podcast in my head.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.680]   - I know, it's like, okay,
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.480]   times nine divided by five, plus 32, yeah.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.320]   - People can look it up.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.920]   - Yeah, look it up.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:33.280]   So the thing with cold water exposure
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.360]   is the whole conversation about ice cold, ice baths,
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.120]   and how cold it is, it's too cold for women.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.880]   Because when we're looking at that severe,
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.560]   immediate jump into that icy cold,
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.000]   it causes such severe constriction and shutdown.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.360]   So women do really well and get that whole dopamine response
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   and everything if the water is around 16 degrees C,
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.040]   which is 55 to 56 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.080]   - Which is chilly.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:04.920]   - It's chilly.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.760]   - It's not warm.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.160]   - No, it's go dive in San Francisco Bay, right?
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.320]   And that is enough to offset
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:15.160]   that severe constriction survival,
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.280]   but it is cold enough to invoke all the changes
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.920]   that we want with cold water exposure.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.240]   So it's a temperature nuance that sets sex difference.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.960]   And like I said, when I have open water swimmers
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.360]   who are going to do a long swim
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:36.000]   or they're going to do a triathlon and the water is colder,
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.920]   I have them do cold water exposure,
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:41.760]   especially face exposure into the cold water
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:46.760]   to get them habituated to that initial severe constriction
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.160]   and sympathetic activity
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:52.160]   that we don't want to happen before a race.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.240]   With heat being the truth,
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.840]   like true heat that we're talking about with sauna,
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.840]   we see a lot of metabolic changes for women.
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.800]   So we're having better insulin and glucose control.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.800]   We're seeing a better expression of our heat shock proteins
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.880]   and the uncoupling and the rebuilding of those proteins
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.480]   that are cardiovascular responses.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.000]   And then for women, as we get older
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.440]   and have the offshoot of hot flashes,
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.480]   night sweats, that kind of stuff.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.840]   If you're doing heat exposure,
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.000]   you're sending a stronger stimulus to the hypothalamus
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.680]   and you're also getting a better serotonin production
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.560]   from the gut because we have 95% of our serotonin
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.040]   produced from the gut,
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.760]   which lends to better temperature control
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.680]   and shuts down hot flashes.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:48.080]   - I think some people might be confused
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.480]   by the idea of using sauna
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.080]   in order to reduce the hot flashes.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.400]   So I'll just remind people that your brain
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.920]   has a set of neurons in the medial preoptic area
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.480]   that's sort of a thermostat, if you will,
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.200]   controlling core body temperature.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.000]   And if you heat the surface of your body,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.440]   your medial preoptic neurons say,
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.800]   "Oh, let's cool down the core of the body."
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.280]   Now, if you stay in that heat too long,
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.380]   you'll cook, your core body temperature will go up.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.680]   But conversely, if the surface of your body is made cold,
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.640]   the internal milieu of your body will heat up
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.220]   'cause those medial preoptic neurons will say,
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:27.920]   "Oh, this is like putting an ice pack on the thermostat,"
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.720]   which is what graduate students and postdocs
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.120]   used to do in the lab side working
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.880]   'cause it was a battle over the heater, right?
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.440]   Some people were in hot, some people were in cold.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.480]   So it was always this business.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.160]   In any event, so it's not that you disapprove
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.240]   of using deliberate cold exposure.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:47.280]   You just recommend that women do deliberate cold exposure
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.520]   with temperatures that are maybe
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:53.040]   in the low 50 degree Fahrenheit range,
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.620]   as opposed to the really, frankly,
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.500]   just painfully cold for anybody,
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:05.200]   38 to 50 degree temperatures, is that right?
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.860]   - We did a pilot study looking,
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.280]   'cause Wim Hof has been down to New Zealand quite a bit.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.320]   And so his breathing and ice bath stuff
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.920]   has been making the rounds.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.720]   And working in the high performance,
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.940]   people wanted to do that.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.260]   But we have few athletes
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:22.540]   that have really severe endometriosis.
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:24.700]   It's like, well, we could look at using cold exposure
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.180]   to help control that.
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.760]   And what we found over the course of this study
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:31.980]   was that if we were to do deliberate cold exposure
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:37.560]   around ovulation and then hold it for 10 days
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.160]   over the course of three menstrual cycles,
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:43.420]   it attenuated the endometriosis.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:46.700]   'Cause endometriosis is an inflammatory disease, right?
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.780]   So if we're looking at inflammation process
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.380]   and growing the tissue,
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:51.960]   if we can dampen that inflammation
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:55.700]   and create a response that learns that inflammation
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:59.220]   and dampens it, then it helps with endometriosis.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.060]   - Very interesting.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.980]   - So that's another avenue that we really wanna take
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:06.700]   when we're looking at deliberate cold exposure.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.960]   - Wow, fascinating.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.180]   As a cautionary note,
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:13.940]   if anyone is going to explore Wim Hof type methods,
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:17.340]   please, please, please do not combine
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:21.020]   cyclic hyperventilation or hyperventilation of any kind
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.900]   with breath holds and water exposure,
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:25.460]   not even in the depth of a puddle.
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:27.340]   There have been drownings associated
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.380]   with people doing cyclic hyperventilation
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.900]   in various contexts, not just related to Hof breathing,
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.400]   but basically people who are not skilled
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.820]   and even some who are skilled
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.740]   combining cyclic hyperventilation, breath holds and water
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.460]   in any form, cold or warm water.
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:43.380]   - Bad idea. - Just don't.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:44.620]   If you're going to do any kind
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:46.020]   of cyclic hyperventilation breathing,
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.860]   and my lab's actually published on this in a clinical trial,
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:51.420]   do it on dry land or don't do it at all.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:54.040]   And if you're going to do deliberate cold exposure,
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.860]   limit your breathing to slow, deep breaths,
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:00.980]   make sure that you're well-supervised
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.300]   and just stay alive, please.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:06.220]   - Yeah, we didn't incorporate any of the Wim Hof breathing.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.020]   We just incorporated the deliberate water,
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:10.500]   cold water exposures.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.140]   - Cold and temperature generally
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:13.660]   is such a potent stimulus.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.060]   And it's exciting that people are starting to explore this,
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.340]   especially the, in my opinion, the sauna work.
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:21.780]   One thing I suppose that we should discuss
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.080]   very briefly before we move on,
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.780]   since we've been talking about resistance training,
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:29.060]   we've been talking about deliberate cold exposure.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:32.580]   There is evidence that doing deliberate cold exposure,
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.100]   not so much in the form of a cold shower,
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.660]   but in the form of a submersion up to the neck,
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:40.020]   post-strength or resistance training,
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:42.180]   say in the four, but probably the eight hours
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:43.220]   after resistance training,
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:45.960]   because of the attenuation of the inflammatory response,
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.420]   which sounds like a great thing,
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.380]   it actually can inhibit some of the strength
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:52.420]   and hypertrophy gains that one would otherwise experience.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:55.340]   So if you're going to do deliberate cold exposure,
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:57.620]   best to not do it in the eight hours
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:01.980]   or even on the same day after resistance training
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.500]   geared towards developing strength
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.000]   and hypertrophy increases.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.480]   No problem to do it first.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.600]   In fact, maybe even some performance enhancing effects
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.440]   of doing it first.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:10.820]   There's some athletes at Stanford doing that,
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:12.220]   but just want to throw that out there.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.860]   Is there anything else you want to add to that?
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.500]   - Which is different from heat exposure,
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.020]   because heat exposure you want to do afterwards.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:19.860]   - Get the vasodilation.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:23.740]   - Yeah, because it extends that training stimulus
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:28.100]   and also the passive dehydration from training
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:31.500]   will stimulate greater blood volume improvements.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.620]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.860]   So after a good weight training session,
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.340]   if one has the luxury of doing it,
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.060]   get into the sauna for-
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.340]   - Up to 30 minutes.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.200]   - Make sure you're hydrating.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.940]   - You want slow rehydration
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.660]   because part of it is that dehydration
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:49.480]   and the decrease of oxygen at the level of the kidney
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:51.340]   to stimulate more EPO.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.820]   So with more red cell production,
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:55.060]   you have natural increase in plasma volume.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.700]   So it's a blood volume expander.
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:57.620]   - Ooh, so now we're getting
[01:43:57.620 --> 01:43:59.300]   into real performance enhancement.
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.700]   Is this true for men and for women?
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:01.860]   - Yep, yep.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.260]   - Let's walk through this protocol.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.820]   I like this.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.460]   This has not been discussed on this podcast.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:11.300]   So somebody does their resistance training,
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:15.660]   finishes up, drinks eight or 16 ounces of water
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.440]   with a little salt in it maybe,
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.320]   and then hops in the sauna.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.160]   - Yep.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.580]   - For how long?
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:22.860]   - Up to 30 minutes.
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:23.700]   - Okay.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.520]   - No longer.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:25.360]   - No longer.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.200]   - No longer, yeah.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.140]   - They'll probably be a little bit thirsty in there.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.060]   You're looking for a little low level dehydration.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.020]   Is that right?
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:31.860]   - Yep.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:32.960]   - Okay.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:36.060]   The ranges that I've seen published in the finished studies
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:39.020]   are, as I recall, and I'll double-check these numbers,
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:44.180]   186 degrees Fahrenheit up to about 210 Fahrenheit.
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:48.560]   And the higher end only being for those
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.140]   that are heat adapted.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:51.160]   - Yeah.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.580]   - One can cover their head with a towel
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.020]   and actually feel more comfortable
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:55.260]   because the brain is insulated.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.160]   This surprises people.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.340]   They think putting something on their head
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.520]   would make it excessively warm.
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.360]   - Yeah.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.260]   - But you actually are protecting your brain
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:03.300]   from some of the heat.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:04.900]   - And people will put a towel over it
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.380]   so that when they breathe it doesn't burn
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:10.620]   the inside of their nose and their mouth either.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.300]   I'm always like, if you're gonna be in and it's that hot,
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.540]   just move down a level.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.220]   So then--
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.040]   - Down on the floor?
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:18.220]   - Yep.
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:20.920]   - And this stimulates the production
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.380]   of more red blood cells?
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.220]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:24.040]   - Okay.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.620]   Which then translates to what
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.900]   in terms of athletic performance?
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.500]   - You have an increase in your cardiovascular effort.
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.100]   And because you have a greater amount of blood volumes,
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:37.580]   you have greater amount of pretty much blood circulating.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:42.580]   So you have more available for muscle metabolism, heat loss.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:46.740]   So it's akin to going to altitude.
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.620]   So people will go to altitude
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.260]   to get that blood volume boost,
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.940]   but not everyone responds to altitude
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.020]   'cause you have responders,
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.940]   non-responders over responders.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.760]   - Okay.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.940]   This is why when I go to Colorado,
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:59.940]   I'm gasping for air while I do a walk,
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:03.140]   but then I come back to sea level and I feel better.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:03.980]   My endurance is better,
[01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:05.980]   but some people might not experience that effect.
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:06.820]   - True.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.380]   This is, I was telling the guys before we started
[01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:10.620]   that I've been in our sauna at home
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.900]   in preparation for going to Park City
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:16.300]   because I live at a beach town and going to Park City,
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:19.420]   I am a significant responder to altitude
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:22.540]   and I won't be able to have coherent meetings at altitude
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:25.140]   if I am not adapted, so.
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:25.980]   - Okay.
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:26.800]   - Yeah.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.300]   - So this explains why when I've gone to meetings
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.620]   in Colorado at altitude,
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.420]   some people can have a drink that first night
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.440]   and they're perfectly fine,
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.260]   even though they normally live at sea level
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.020]   and I'm trying to see the stairs correctly,
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.380]   even though I don't drink.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:40.180]   - Yep, that would be it.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.020]   - Very interesting.
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:44.260]   So you can use post-resistance training sauna exposure
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:47.420]   to improve performance.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:48.260]   - Yeah.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:51.460]   And you can use it post-cardio as well.
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:54.860]   So anything that is giving you that passive dehydration
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.340]   from training 'cause you're not,
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:58.460]   because you will become passively dehydrated
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:46:59.380]   when you're training, right?
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:02.760]   You can't keep in as much fluid.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.240]   So I'm saying passive as in,
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.080]   you're not able to stop that dehydration.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.200]   And then you go into the sauna
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.920]   and you are extending that training stimulus
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.280]   'cause your heart rate is elevated.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:18.480]   You're putting your body under stress from dehydration
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.540]   and the body responds in kind of we need more blood volume.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.880]   So let's jumpstart that.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.700]   - I love it.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:29.280]   Logically watertight and I'm gonna give it a try.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.240]   - Yeah.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.320]   - What other training tricks, tips
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.600]   do you have up your sleeve, Dr. Sims?
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:36.000]   - What you wanna talk about?
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.760]   - Do you have any favorites besides that?
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.100]   I delight in these and I know other people will as well.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:44.200]   Do any come to mind?
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.300]   I mean, you've taught us about Shashandra,
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:51.200]   about post-training sauna exposure to improve performance
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.120]   by increasing red blood cell count.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:54.760]   Is there anything else that kind of springs to mind?
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.980]   No pressure.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.240]   - I'm a fan of what I call the track stack
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.880]   that we used to use for track athletes,
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.880]   but then for really significant high intensity work.
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:10.300]   So track stack is kind of the idea
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:11.780]   from the old bodybuilding set
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:15.260]   where you're taking 200 milligrams of caffeine,
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:20.440]   low dose baby aspirin, but then I add beta alanine.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:21.680]   - Used to be ephedrine.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.520]   - I know.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.720]   - So I'm old enough to remember when they would sell it
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.240]   as the triple stack with ephedrine,
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.760]   but some people dropped dead
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:30.280]   and they took it off the market.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.840]   - Hey, it came back on the market in New Zealand last week.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:33.660]   - Did it really?
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.500]   - Yeah.
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.320]   - It gets you going.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.160]   - Yes, it does.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.800]   - It's speedy.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.440]   It's dangerous.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.820]   - But the track stack, which has beta alanine
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:47.400]   and not ephedrine is really good
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.360]   at encouraging an extra top end effect
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.560]   'cause you're having the caffeine,
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.280]   you're having a little bit of the blood thin
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.320]   from the aspirin and then the vasodilatory properties
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:03.140]   and the carnosine aspect for muscle contraction
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:04.800]   from the beta alanine.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.720]   And so like training for gravel races in the top end sprint,
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.680]   you do a couple of sprint sessions with that
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.120]   and it's increasing your training stress
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:14.960]   during the training.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.000]   So your adaptation is to that higher stress.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.080]   - Should anything be done in terms of recovery
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.280]   to make sure that you offset that additional stress?
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.040]   That's achieved with this track stack.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:29.920]   - Yeah, just making sure that you're not stacking
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.320]   two days in a row of high intensity work,
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.360]   like really making sure that you're recovering well
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.360]   'cause it is a significant stress on the body.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:38.440]   - What about sleep?
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440]   We hear so much these days about the importance of sleep
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.080]   for mental health, physical health, performance.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.840]   I think this is a great thing, a great trend.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.040]   Are there female specific requirements for sleep
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.100]   that vary across the menstrual cycle and or by age
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.400]   or just generally, do men and women need to think about
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.000]   the need for sleep differently?
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.500]   - Yeah, part of it is the obvious.
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:04.340]   Like when you're talking about sleep temperature, right?
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:08.360]   Women and men have variations in their sleep temperature
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:09.200]   and what's optimal.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.480]   So looking at that, like you need to create an environment
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.440]   for you that is cool, comfortable,
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:17.600]   which is probably gonna be different from your partner
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.040]   who might be sharing your bed.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.760]   So that becomes a sticky point.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:22.140]   When we talk about the menstrual cycle,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.760]   there are definitive changes in sleep architecture.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:30.280]   We're seeing that in around the mid luteal
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.540]   to the premenstrual.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:36.300]   So you know that about 10 days before your period starts.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:39.280]   Significant change in your slow wave sleep.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.520]   There's less of it.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.220]   Latency is increased.
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.160]   So you have a longer time to get to sleep
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.560]   and you have more light sleep.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:49.300]   So overall, you know, less of that deep recovery sleep.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:52.100]   And this is where women tend to have more
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:54.140]   of their mood issues too,
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:57.760]   because of estrogens play with serotonin in the brain.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.500]   So we really need to nail down our sleep hygiene
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:01.780]   in that time period.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:07.380]   So looking at things like L-theanine and apigenin
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:11.840]   and looking at your room temperature and the screens
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.780]   and all the things that you've talked about
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.340]   for the most part about sleep and sleep hygiene.
[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:17.580]   Super important.
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:19.420]   And then of course, as you get older,
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:21.980]   in both men and women, it becomes more difficult to sleep.
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:25.380]   But we see a significant issue with insomnia
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.060]   in women who have really bad hot flushes
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.820]   and significant menopausal symptoms.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:34.580]   And again, this has to do with lots of the perturbations
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:39.020]   from temperatures, night sweats, increased sympathetic load,
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:41.820]   not being able to get into a parasympathetic state.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:44.920]   So this is where working with a specific sleep specialist
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.180]   might come into play.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.220]   We can also look at using some adaptogens,
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.940]   the rhodiola stacked with theanine,
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:55.060]   and looking at the cold temperature,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.980]   getting people to use the non-sleep deep rest
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:01.360]   or yoga nidra or some other kind of meditative property
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:04.220]   that they can then access when they're in bed.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.620]   So there's a lot of different things
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:06.980]   that we have to be aware of.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:10.440]   And again, in that perimenopausal state,
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.540]   we see that significant change in sleep
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.500]   and sleep architecture and quality of the sleep,
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.260]   but men don't have the same thing.
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.660]   So women have to be a little bit more aligned
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.460]   with what's happening from a hormonal profile standpoint,
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:26.860]   because it does definitively affect serotonin, melatonin,
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:29.540]   and sleep architecture because of the interplay
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:33.100]   that estrogen has on the brain and the receptors.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.140]   - That makes very good sense.
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.900]   We'll put a link in the show notes captions
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.080]   to some zero-cost non-sleep deep rest yoga nidras.
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:41.260]   We've put out a couple with my voice,
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.040]   if you prefer another voice.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.500]   I'm a big fan of the ones by Kelly Boyes,
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.780]   who's contributed to the Waking Up app.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.820]   It also has terrific non-sleep deep rest yoga nidras
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:54.140]   out there, and there are others as well.
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:55.900]   You mentioned a few supplements.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:00.700]   Theanine, epigenin, which is chamomile extract.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:02.940]   Maybe let's just have a general conversation
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:03.780]   about supplements.
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:06.020]   What's your thought on supplements?
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.780]   How do you place them into the landscape of nutrition?
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.900]   They are after all supplements, not replacements.
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:13.240]   But the word supplements, I believe,
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.600]   is a little bit misleading
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.320]   because there are food-based supplements,
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.380]   like a protein powder.
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:21.760]   There are supplements designed to achieve
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.820]   a specific outcome, and then there are supplements
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:27.080]   that are designed to be a more support
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:29.600]   for a bunch of things, kind of insurance policy.
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:33.600]   What are some of your favorite supplements
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   in any of those categories, specifically for women,
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:39.340]   and perhaps even specifically during certain phases
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:42.280]   of the menstrual cycle and/or perimenopause menopause?
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:44.880]   I just threw about nine questions at you.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.340]   Okay, the number one is creatine.
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:50.220]   Creatine for women, doesn't matter what age.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:52.840]   It's really important, we're seeing a lot,
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:57.240]   for brain mood and actually gut health.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:00.080]   So five grams of creatine monohydrate per day,
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.100]   sort of typical? Three to five.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.800]   Three to five? Yep.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:04.360]   Preferably, of course, Creapure
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.920]   'cause of the way it's produced.
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.400]   So if you're looking at Creapure,
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.600]   it's the German company that produces it,
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.880]   uses a water-based wash to produce the creatine.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.720]   Interesting.
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.880]   Whereas others use an acid-based wash,
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:18.340]   and we see a lot of side effects with the acid-based wash.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:19.720]   Like gastric distress. Yeah.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:21.120]   So people are like, "Oh, I'm really bloated,
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:23.200]   "and I have nausea and stuff from taking creatine."
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.620]   I'm like, "Is it Creapure?"
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:26.720]   Actually, no, it's like switch to Creapure.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.880]   And so they switch, and they're like,
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.400]   "Oh my gosh, I feel so much better."
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.400]   Noted. Yeah.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:35.440]   And then vitamin D3, really important,
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:39.520]   especially when we're looking at all the information
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.880]   that's coming out from cardiovascular, muscle, brain,
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.080]   everything that goes with vitamin D, also with iron.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.720]   So vitamin D is really important
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:50.300]   for absorbing and maintaining iron stores.
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.480]   So those are the two big ones, and then-
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.840]   Sorry, I just want to stop you for a moment.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.720]   As it relates to creatine,
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:00.720]   I hear two general lines of concern.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:03.920]   One, I hear more often from women.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.600]   My understanding is that because creatine
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.080]   brings water into the muscle,
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:09.320]   as well as supporting the phosphocreatine system
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.080]   of the brain, the water into the muscle component means,
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:18.080]   yes, people who take creatine, three to five grams per day,
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:21.080]   will gain a few pounds of body weight.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.040]   That's solid body weight in the form of water
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:26.320]   within the muscle, so solid in air quotes.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.260]   It's water, but it's within the muscle.
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:31.480]   So they should know that.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:33.660]   It's not a given, though.
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:34.500]   - Interesting.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.320]   - It's not a given.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.500]   There are some women on the lower dose of three
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.460]   that don't experience the water gain.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:42.640]   - Okay, and this is not bloat, like water,
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.280]   subcutaneous water.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.960]   This is water within the muscles.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.040]   So it will be stored within lean tissue.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.200]   And then I do hear concerns
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.560]   about creatine causing hair loss.
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.640]   My understanding is there is zero evidence for that.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.180]   There is a smidgen of evidence
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:02.480]   that it might increase dihydrotestosterone levels,
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:05.320]   but it's like one study, marginal increase,
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:08.560]   and then people linked dihydrotestosterone to hair loss.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:11.040]   And so then the conclusion people drew
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.160]   was that somehow creatine increases hair loss.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.000]   But you're saying zero evidence.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]   - No evidence.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.920]   We see that women who start taking it midlife
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.160]   are complaining about it,
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:24.220]   but it's actually a progestin-driven thing.
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:27.400]   We see progesterone and fluctuation of progesterone
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:30.080]   can exacerbate any hair loss.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.840]   So if women are experiencing that
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.600]   and they're saying, "Oh, it's creatine.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.160]   "I've read all this stuff on creatine."
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.400]   No, it's not.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.420]   - Okay, so we've got creatine D3,
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.200]   1,000 IUs per day, 5,000 IUs.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:43.360]   I guess it depends a little bit.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.760]   - Yeah.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.760]   Being very close to Antarctica
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:49.440]   in the Southern Hemisphere in the winter,
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.600]   very low sunlight exposure,
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.440]   looking at around the 5,000.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:58.360]   Same with Upper Northern Hemisphere, UK,
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.360]   that kind of stuff.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.880]   The closer you get to the equator, the less you need.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.440]   The one concern is like a day here where it's foggy
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:05.520]   and it's supposed to be sunny.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.040]   And people are like, "Great, I don't have to worry
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.560]   "about going out in sun exposure."
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.320]   But then the next day it's bright and sunny.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.120]   And they're like, "Ooh, sunscreen."
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:15.200]   So they put sunscreen on
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:16.680]   and not getting the right sun exposure.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.960]   So then again, it is a lifestyle thing.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.280]   So basic is two to 5,000.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.320]   - Great.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:25.040]   Okay, so we've got creatine, vitamin D3.
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.560]   What are some of the other supplements
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:30.640]   that you take or that you, I don't know if we say suggest,
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.000]   but that you perhaps suggest women consider?
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.440]   - Yeah, so protein powder, really good high quality
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.040]   because the amount of protein that women should be getting
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.640]   is often difficult to eat.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.560]   So again, supplementing, not using it as the mainstay.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:50.160]   That's one to consider.
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:53.040]   And then again, I'm about adaptogens.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.400]   So looking at the different adaptogens,
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:57.000]   ashwagandha is a good one.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.160]   Holy basil or tulsi is another one, shishandra.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.520]   And then getting into some of your medicinal mushrooms,
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.840]   lion's mane, reishi.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.940]   Those are the two big ones that I look to
[01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:09.720]   and often have women use.
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.800]   - If these adaptogens blunt cortisol,
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:17.160]   because certain ones do like ashwagandha,
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:19.080]   which by the way, I do think people should cycle
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.240]   if they're gonna take it high doses, right?
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.480]   'Cause there are some issues with liver.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.320]   - And thyroid.
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:26.960]   - And thyroid problems if people take ashwagandha
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.640]   at high doses for too long.
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:31.760]   So that's important to note.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:34.240]   But assuming that the adaptogens
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:37.520]   are reducing cortisol levels,
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:38.860]   in addition to doing other things,
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.340]   is there a particular time of day or night
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:43.520]   that people should consider taking them?
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.280]   Should they avoid taking it early in the day?
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:49.200]   My understanding was that you want a bit of that cortisol
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.320]   bump early in the day,
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:53.040]   but you certainly want cortisol lower later in the day.
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:55.940]   - Yep, and I think the problem is people think
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:57.560]   that they don't want any cortisol.
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.400]   And they think--
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.220]   - That would be bad.
[01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:00.060]   - That would be bad.
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:02.320]   They don't understand that the body has fluctuations
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:05.180]   of cortisol throughout the day and that's normal.
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:07.600]   If we're looking at having issues with sleeping
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:11.540]   and that anxiety provoke from that sympathetic drive
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:13.240]   and elevation of cortisol,
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.440]   let it peak in the morning after you're waking up
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:19.480]   and look late afternoon, like four o'clock
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.560]   when it starts to dip, to take your adaptogens then.
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.120]   'Cause then it feeds forward to being able to relax more,
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.480]   which feeds forward to better sleep.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:29.600]   For something like Shoshandra,
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:32.200]   where you're looking for that brain focus,
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.240]   you can have it in the morning.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:37.560]   It doesn't necessarily have as big an impact on cortisol
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:41.560]   that you see with something like Tulsi or Ashwagandha.
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:44.540]   'Cause Shoshandra's more stimulatory.
[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:46.840]   The other two are more calming.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:49.620]   I put some in my morning coffee and then in the afternoon,
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:51.760]   when I need to pick me up instead of more caffeine,
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:53.160]   I'll use Shoshandra.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:55.520]   'Cause it gives you that boost without the effects
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.680]   of caffeine and it doesn't interfere with sleep.
[01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:59.400]   So there's a time and a place to take them.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:01.080]   And yes, some need to be cycled on,
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.640]   some need to be cycled off.
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:05.820]   But I tell women, what are your main symptoms?
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:07.760]   What are the things you're looking to control?
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.560]   And we can look and see what kind of adaptogens we can use
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.280]   and how we place them.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:15.840]   - What's the story with pregnancy and training?
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:16.680]   - Yeah.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:19.560]   - Is there an official word on this?
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:22.880]   Assuming a woman knows that she's pregnant
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:26.480]   from the very beginning of missing a period
[02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:28.400]   where she's in a position to make decisions
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.040]   about training or not training,
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:32.540]   training at a given intensity or not.
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:35.640]   What are your recommendations?
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:38.160]   - The human body is really interesting.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:39.280]   And when you get pregnant,
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.680]   your body tells you what you can do.
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.760]   So we see that you have a reduction
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.220]   in your anaerobic capacity on purpose.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.760]   Your body's trying to be protective.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.360]   You do have an expansion of your blood volume.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:51.960]   So endurance is really good,
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.900]   but you can't do high intensity.
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:56.940]   When we're looking at the general guidelines
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:58.360]   that are out there,
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.520]   they've gotten rid of the heart rate rule.
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:04.040]   They are now telling women to be as active as they can be
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:09.040]   without creating injury and without trying to make gains.
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:10.860]   So that means if you're in the weight room,
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:14.380]   you're not looking to improve, you're looking to maintain.
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:16.800]   If you're doing cardiovascular work
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:19.660]   and you have a specific class that you'd love to go to,
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.960]   yeah, but don't beat yourself up
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:22.400]   that you can't hit that high intensity.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.400]   You're going for the social aspect.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.180]   You're not trying to gain fitness.
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:27.720]   You're trying to maintain.
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:30.080]   I think the very worst possible scenario
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.200]   is someone is super active and stops doing everything
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.480]   because they're afraid.
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.900]   'Cause then they get deconditioned
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:38.360]   and then they end up in a worse state
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.360]   than someone who was sedentary,
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:42.920]   who's now encouraged to walk during exercise.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.280]   It hasn't been well-researched
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:47.000]   because you can't get ethics
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.160]   to study pregnant women very well.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.220]   So we go on a lot on case studies and case study notes.
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:56.620]   And the bottom line of it all is you stay active
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:01:58.340]   and you can do resistance training.
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:00.260]   You can do all the cardiovascular work
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:03.820]   and your body will tell you what you can and can't do.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:06.900]   - I've been asked whether or not pregnant women
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:09.460]   can do deliberate cold exposure
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:14.380]   probably no fewer than 2,500 times on social media.
[02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:16.020]   And I never have an answer,
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:19.940]   but I always default to the cautious answer,
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:22.520]   which is please don't until you talk to somebody
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.120]   who actually has an answer.
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.380]   Just because it sounds like a very precarious situation,
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:27.980]   but in all honesty, I don't know.
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:30.020]   I'm just biding time there and just saying,
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:30.900]   please go ask somebody
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:32.540]   who can give you a definitive answer.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:36.380]   - Yeah, so we see women who have a high risk for miscarriage
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:39.020]   that anything that they do that's incredibly stressful
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.200]   for the first 12 to 20 weeks,
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.240]   will put them at a higher risk for it.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:48.760]   So while being very cautious, especially with cold,
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.140]   because we know that there are so many different nuances,
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:54.980]   doing something like hot yoga when you're pregnant
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.500]   is not, there is research, so it's not detrimental.
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:02:59.860]   - Really? - Yeah.
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:03.500]   Because when we're looking at blood flow diversion that way,
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:08.500]   when you have slight hypoxia to the placenta and to the baby,
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:14.180]   there is a rebound effect that increases the vascularization
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:17.520]   so that the baby has better nutrients.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:21.120]   We see this also with exercise and exercise intensities.
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:22.500]   This is why people are now saying
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:25.080]   you need to have some kind of blood flow change
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.960]   and increase in core temperature
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.520]   to create these vascular effects within the placenta
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.960]   to improve nutrient and nutrient delivery
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.300]   to the developing fetus.
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.440]   So heat's good.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:39.480]   Cold, I'm not so sure of.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.100]   - But probably not extreme heat.
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:42.320]   - Not extreme heat.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:43.760]   So that's why I mean like hot yoga
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:45.580]   is not going to the sauna.
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:48.680]   Hot yoga sits around 40 degrees Celsius.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.520]   So what is that?
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:52.200]   Just around 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.680]   And in that situation, if you're feeling too hot,
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:58.200]   you leave, you lie down on the floor,
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:00.880]   don't try to stay for the whole class,
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:03.280]   but it's not going to be detrimental
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.460]   unless you're pushing yourself too much.
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:06.800]   Again, everything in moderation,
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:08.360]   especially when you're pregnant.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.560]   - It's almost the inverse of what we know for males,
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:14.000]   which is if men want to conceive,
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.740]   they should avoid the sauna
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:18.640]   because we know that heat is detrimental
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:22.240]   to sperm viability in a real way.
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:25.080]   So much so that I tell guys
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.420]   if they are trying to get their partner pregnant
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:29.560]   that they should bring an ice pack into the sauna.
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:31.200]   They should insulate that ice pack.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:34.000]   Don't put it directly on the scrotum for other reasons,
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.700]   but that the effects of heat,
[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:39.580]   the negative effects of heat on sperm are real.
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:41.880]   But there's also an interesting, it's not just a trend.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.200]   There's actually some research showing
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:47.360]   that cooling the testicles
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:50.720]   leads to increases in testosterone,
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:55.480]   which is on the face of it kind of counterintuitive
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:59.840]   because it turns out that it's about the vasoconstriction
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:04.320]   causing the subsequent increase in blood flow,
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.600]   increased vasodilation.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.440]   So the inverse of what you just said,
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:09.620]   which is that during the heating process,
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:13.620]   the hypoxia induces more vascularization of the placenta.
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:15.740]   So when talking about temperature,
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:17.780]   one always has to think about the surface of the body
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:19.940]   versus the brain response, as we talked about earlier.
[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:22.100]   And then what's happening during the deliberate heat
[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:23.940]   or deliberate cold versus what's happening
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.100]   after the deliberate heat or deliberate cold, right?
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.580]   Everything in biology is a process, not an event.
[02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:31.220]   - Yeah, and I should make full disclosure.
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:34.020]   I started as an environmental exercise physiologist
[02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:37.180]   and my PhD was all in heat and heat research.
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:40.100]   So I'm a little bit biased towards heat,
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:43.140]   but I've done a significant amount of research
[02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:44.340]   in the hot and cold.
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:45.580]   - Thank you for the disclosure.
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:49.800]   I see it more as an indication of real knowledge.
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.640]   So thank you.
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:52.740]   This is an aspect of your training I knew a little bit about
[02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:53.740]   based on your publications,
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:55.200]   but I didn't realize the depth of knowledge.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.380]   So we're all benefiting here,
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:59.740]   including this earlier protocol of sauna post-training.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:00.640]   You can bet a lot of people
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:02.020]   are gonna start incorporating that.
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:03.660]   I think we might need to name that.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:06.300]   I've done this from time to time, named protocols,
[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:08.420]   because people are reluctant to name them after themselves.
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:11.820]   Maybe we call that the SIMS protocol
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:13.020]   or something like that.
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:14.420]   (laughs)
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:17.460]   Anyway, your discomfort will be other people's benefit.
[02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:20.420]   Now seems like a good time
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:22.860]   to address some specific questions
[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:27.860]   related to the age brackets that you mentioned earlier.
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:30.180]   In anticipation of sitting down with you today,
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:32.860]   I asked some different women that I know,
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:34.780]   if you could ask the world expert
[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:39.780]   in exercise physiology, hormones, and nutrition, et cetera,
[02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:42.660]   as it relates to women, one question, what would it be?
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:44.660]   And one of the most common questions I got
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:48.540]   in the 50 and up category was,
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:50.620]   what is the most efficient way
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:53.220]   for a woman older than 50 to train
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:57.140]   for the maximum healthspan and lifespan benefits?
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.460]   - I love this question 'cause I get it all the time.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:02.420]   We have to turn our brains away from everything
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:05.380]   that's been predicated before to this point.
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:07.020]   So if we're looking for longevity
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.540]   and we're looking at what we want to do
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:11.380]   when we're 80 or 90, we want to be independently living,
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:13.620]   we want to have good proprioception balance,
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:16.840]   we want to have good bones, and we want to be strong.
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:19.500]   So this is where we look at 10 minutes,
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:21.680]   three times a week, jump training.
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:24.640]   So this isn't your landing softly in our knees.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:27.960]   This is like impact in the skeletal system.
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:30.980]   A colleague and friend of mine, Tracy Klissel,
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:35.260]   did a PhD and post, not a post-doc,
[02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:39.100]   but post-research on this and is developing an app on it
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:42.460]   to show women how to jump to improve bone mineral density.
[02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:45.300]   Over the course of four months of this type of training,
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:49.700]   people have gone from being osteopeniac
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:51.140]   to normal bone density.
[02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:53.200]   So it's a different type of stress.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.460]   So if your concern is that,
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:56.700]   which a lot of women do have a concern
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:59.180]   'cause they lose about 1/3 of their bone mass
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:01.420]   at the onset of menopause.
[02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:02.380]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.420]   Significant amount. - 1/3?
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:04.340]   - Yeah.
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:05.180]   - Goodness gracious.
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:06.860]   - If you don't do something as an intervention.
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.500]   So we see a lot of women are like,
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:11.260]   "Oh, I'm going to go on menopause hormone therapy
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.420]   "to stop bone loss."
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.580]   Yeah, it can be a treatment,
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:18.260]   but I always look at an external stress
[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:19.380]   that we can put on the body
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:22.880]   that's gonna invoke a change without pharmaceuticals.
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:26.460]   So jump training, heavy resistance training,
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:27.900]   and sprint interval training.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:30.020]   Those are the three key things.
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:32.140]   And from a training standpoint,
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:35.420]   and then from a nutrition standpoint, getting protein.
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:37.100]   Protein is so important.
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:39.300]   When you start telling women they need to look at
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:43.420]   around one to 1.1 grams per pound,
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:47.380]   which is around that two to 2.3 grams per kilo per day,
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:49.540]   they're like, "Whoa, that's a lot of protein."
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:52.380]   It is because we haven't been conditioned to eat it,
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:53.900]   but reality- - It's a few scrambled eggs.
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:54.900]   - Yeah. - It's a chicken breast
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:55.740]   at lunch. - Yeah.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:57.300]   - It's a small steak at dinner.
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:58.460]   - Yeah. - Plus other things.
[02:08:58.460 --> 02:08:59.300]   - Right, exactly.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:00.980]   And it doesn't all have to be animal products.
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.500]   I mean, you're looking at all the different beans
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:04.100]   and things that you can put together,
[02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:05.460]   and that's the other big thing,
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:07.580]   that in order to build the muscle
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:10.500]   and to keep the body composition in a state
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:13.420]   that we want it to keep going for longevity,
[02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:15.140]   those are the big rocks.
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:16.340]   The sprint interval training,
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.780]   the heavy resistance training,
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:20.060]   the jump training, and the protein.
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.020]   - I'm thinking about this,
[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:24.100]   and I'm thinking about my mother who's 79 years old.
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:28.300]   She'll be 80 at the end of June and is in good health,
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.500]   walks a lot, gardens, does some yoga,
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:33.060]   but does none of the things that you're describing.
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.060]   So mom, please, I'm gonna send her to listen to this.
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:37.900]   - I got my mom to switch.
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:40.140]   - In the same vein,
[02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:45.340]   what about the women out there age 20 to,
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.340]   maybe we make it the 20 to 40 bracket.
[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:51.040]   And if we need to divide that more finely, we can.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.680]   What is the most efficient way for them to train
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:57.520]   for health, vigor, and longevity?
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:01.200]   - Making things fun for the most part.
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.920]   I don't want people to think that it's a chore.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:05.280]   So if you're someone who's been told you need to run
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:07.520]   and you hate running, then don't run.
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.720]   That's common sense.
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:11.440]   And I say that because I see little kids
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:15.960]   in non-US countries that have to run across country.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:19.320]   And you see these kids when they're six years old
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.720]   and they're all running around the field,
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:22.320]   and they're the kids that hate running
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.280]   that aren't natural runners.
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:24.560]   And then they hate physical activity
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:26.000]   for the rest of their life.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.840]   So I put that in, like when you are exercising,
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:31.200]   you wanna find something that you find fun.
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.720]   When you're in your 20s to 40s,
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:35.320]   you have more room to get away with things
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.500]   that might not be optimal for you
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:39.580]   when you start to get older.
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:41.640]   Big rock again is resistance training.
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:43.560]   It doesn't have to be heavy resistance training.
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.200]   Like I said earlier, to failure, you're periodizing.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:49.120]   If you wanna do a block of Olympic lifting, go for it.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:50.540]   If you're like, I'm not comfortable
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:51.720]   doing that kind of lifting,
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:54.360]   I wanna do more machine stuff, great.
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.080]   But we wanna make sure that you're changing it up
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.980]   all the time to keep things moving and shaking
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:01.600]   with regards to strength and hypertrophy.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.700]   And then it becomes more of,
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:05.680]   are you training for something that's endurance?
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:09.460]   Are you looking for just longevity for brain health?
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:12.120]   We need to have some lactate production.
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:14.680]   Because women, as I said at the beginning of the podcast,
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.920]   are more oxidative.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:18.280]   We don't have as many of those glycolytic fibers.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:20.160]   So what we're finding in older research
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:24.060]   is that there's a misstep in brain lactate metabolism.
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:26.120]   Because the brain hasn't been exposed to it,
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:28.560]   especially for looking at women who are being studied now,
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:31.160]   it hasn't been in a societal context
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:33.100]   to do that kind of work.
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.440]   The younger we are and the more that we can keep
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:39.420]   our glycolytic fibers going by doing high intensity work,
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:42.100]   the more we're exposing our brain to lactate,
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:43.960]   the better we see fast forward
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:46.120]   to attenuating cognitive decline
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:49.560]   and reducing the plaque development of Alzheimer's.
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.740]   This is why women who are in their 40s plus,
[02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:54.260]   I want them to do the sprint and the high intensity work
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:55.880]   for that lactate production.
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:58.280]   Start early, because then you can take
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:00.020]   some of those type two B fibers
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:02.400]   that could either go more aerobic or anaerobic
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.120]   and make them more anaerobic.
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.080]   So those are the two big things for women who are younger.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.360]   And then you can play around with the other things
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:13.260]   if you want to be an ultra endurance athlete.
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:15.840]   Yeah, not really ideal, but yeah,
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.840]   you can do that, that's fine, you'll recover well.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:21.040]   - Now, forgive me because you've said it several times
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:22.280]   throughout today's discussion,
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.560]   but I really want to drive home a key point
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.400]   that I think for most people, men and women,
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.560]   is not obvious, but is really important.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.520]   When you say high intensity,
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:38.520]   you don't mean a class or a run
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:40.680]   where you're drenched in sweat
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:44.000]   and gasping for air at the end, necessarily.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.360]   Let's disambiguate high intensity
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.400]   from what most people think of high intensity,
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:50.120]   which is a really hard workout,
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:53.080]   a tough class where they had me moving the whole time,
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:54.920]   doing a circuit, et cetera.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:58.360]   What is the appropriate high intensity workout look like?
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:01.240]   - Okay, so if I talk about
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.800]   true high intensity interval training,
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:05.560]   if you're a runner, it's going to the track
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.040]   and doing sets of 400 to 800s.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.560]   - Okay, so 400, a lap.
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.080]   - Yep. - 800, two laps.
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:16.920]   So you're looking at between a minute and four minutes
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:21.680]   of hard work at 80% or more with variable recovery.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.920]   So that's why I use a track as an example.
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:26.120]   So if you do one lap and you're like,
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.440]   I'm going to walk half a lap and then do it again,
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:29.680]   that's adequate recovery.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:31.640]   - Pretty tough. - Yeah, it's hard.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:33.640]   But it's not like you're going to be there for 90 minutes
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:35.720]   doing as many 400s as you can.
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:37.440]   Because you have that variable recovery,
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:40.360]   it might take a half an hour to 40 minutes max,
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:43.440]   and then you're gassed out, you can't do it anymore.
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:45.980]   If we're looking at a gym situation,
[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:50.200]   I like to look at something like every minute on the minute,
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:54.160]   where you might be doing 10 deadlifts
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:56.040]   at moderate intensity weight.
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.960]   - 10 repetitions. - Yeah.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.600]   So it takes you 50 seconds to complete that.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.120]   Then you have 10 seconds to move to the next exercise
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.640]   that might be thrusters.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.160]   So, you know, a squat clean thruster.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:09.840]   So it's a squat, pulling the weight up overhead.
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:13.280]   So you're doing maybe eight of those in that minute,
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.100]   and you might have 10 second recovery.
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:20.100]   You go to the next exercise that might be kettlebell swings,
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:22.760]   and you're doing explosive kettlebell swings,
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:26.260]   and you'll finish, you know, 10 seconds to go.
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:28.680]   You go to the fourth exercise, I don't know,
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:30.680]   toes to bar or some other kind of V-up,
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:32.440]   some other high intensity.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.840]   And then you have one minute completely off.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.260]   So you've had four minutes of really heavy work
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:40.240]   with maybe 10 seconds to move to the next exercise,
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:41.760]   one minute completely off,
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:43.640]   and then you repeat that three times.
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:45.500]   - And this is high intensity interval training.
[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:47.760]   This is not what you would consider resistance training
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.520]   for sake of building muscle or strength.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.320]   - Correct, this is the cardio. - You're using these loads,
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:54.720]   these machines, the pike, you know, hanging from the bar
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.520]   and bringing your knees up or L-sit or something
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.880]   as a tool to get the heart rate up continually.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:01.400]   - Yep, yep. - Very different
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:02.960]   than resistance training
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.240]   the way most people think about it.
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:06.360]   - Correct, so this is the cardiovascular
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:07.980]   high intensity interval training.
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:11.320]   And the subset of that is sprint interval training.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:13.580]   And this is something that's really, really hard
[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:14.420]   and people don't get it.
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:16.500]   I don't necessarily mean running.
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:18.880]   It can be whatever mode of activity,
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:22.340]   but it's 30 seconds or less as hard as you can go.
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.140]   So this is your nine or 10
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:28.260]   on your rating of perceived exertion, 110%, it's max effort.
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:30.500]   - On the rower, on the Airdyne bike.
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:32.020]   - Yeah. - Running if you like.
[02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:34.460]   - Yeah, any of those things. - The skier, yeah.
[02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:36.860]   - Battle ropes, battle ropes are big.
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:39.080]   - So 30 seconds all out, then rest, what?
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:41.460]   10, 15 seconds, repeat? - No, no.
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:44.660]   You want to, 'cause now we're looking at that top end
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:49.160]   where we want regeneration of your ATP, you know,
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:53.060]   all of that system and central nervous system recovery.
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:55.700]   So this is 30 seconds all out.
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:57.500]   It can be two or three minutes of recovery.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.740]   - Oh, nice. - 'Cause I'm not looking
[02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:01.620]   at Tabata where you're 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.820]   because that's not the intensity we want.
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:07.400]   We want you to go all out and recover well enough
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:09.660]   to be able to go all out again.
[02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:12.020]   You're not leaving anything in the tank.
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:15.580]   So those are what I mean by high intensity interval training
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:17.800]   or when you're looking at polarizing
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:20.340]   your cardiovascular work, that's the top end.
[02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:22.540]   Those are the two examples of your top end.
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:26.060]   And then your recovery is that long, slow walking
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:29.060]   on another day where you're not going and doing a tempo run.
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:31.500]   You're not doing a 5K easy jog
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:33.580]   'cause that puts you in that moderate intensity.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.500]   - And if I heard you correctly earlier,
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:39.460]   you are suggesting most women do one or two days
[02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:41.780]   of high intensity interval training
[02:16:41.780 --> 02:16:45.260]   plus three to four days of resistance training
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:47.060]   for sake of building strength and muscle,
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:48.180]   which looks very different.
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:53.180]   It's more warm up, do a couple work sets,
[02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:56.340]   you know, two to four work sets of, you know,
[02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:58.360]   an overhead press, two or four work sets
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:01.200]   of maybe a barbell curl, two or four sets of some dips
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:04.920]   or whatever one's, you know, personal choices.
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:05.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:07.260]   - Okay, got it.
[02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:11.400]   Very different, far and away different
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.700]   than what most people, men or women are doing out there,
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:19.640]   which is a lot of Stairmaster treadmill jogging,
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:22.320]   maybe some lifting for hypertrophy.
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:24.360]   - Because I look at the general consensus
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.820]   of what's out there in the fitness world
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:29.320]   is all based on aesthetics and body composition.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:31.360]   So people have this mentality of,
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.820]   I need to be hypertrophy to get swole,
[02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:36.380]   and I need to do long, slow stuff on the cardio machine
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:40.800]   to lose body fat, but that isn't what we're after.
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:45.500]   We're after, let's create really strong external stress
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.240]   to create adaptations, not only from a neural
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.720]   and a brain standpoint that's understanding it,
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:53.960]   but also feeding down to metabolic change.
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:57.020]   Because if you have a really significant high stress,
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:17:59.240]   we see epigenetic changes within the muscle
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:01.040]   that increase the amount of what we call
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:04.240]   the GLUT4 gates, so the proteins that open up
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.200]   that allow carbohydrate to come in without insulin.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.440]   So we're expanding that acute glucose uptake
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:13.320]   through an epigenetic change.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.320]   The other thing that it does is it causes
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.580]   an acute inflammatory response
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:19.000]   that your body learns to overcome,
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000]   and it's really important for women to do that.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.240]   Because as we start to lose estrogen,
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.000]   we lose a significant anti-inflammatory agent.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.080]   So this is why we see that increase in the visceral fat,
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:34.880]   especially when we're hitting your mid 40s onwards,
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.280]   is because now you have this increase in free fatty acids
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.200]   and the inability for inflammation to come down.
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:43.880]   So the muscle cell is going,
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:45.400]   "Hmm, I don't know what to do with this."
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:47.480]   So it gets circulated to the liver,
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:50.040]   and the liver stores it as visceral fat.
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:52.060]   Whereas if you do that high intensity work,
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:55.000]   it creates that change within the muscle to understand,
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.640]   pull that in, let's use it,
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:00.240]   let's also bring more carbohydrate in and more glucose in,
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:03.920]   use that, which helps use free fatty acids.
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:08.440]   And it also creates a significant anti-inflammatory response
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:12.320]   at the level of the mitochondria and within the cell itself,
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.400]   which is what estrogen used to do.
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:16.640]   So if we look at those external stresses,
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.320]   it's not about body comp and aesthetics per se,
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:23.400]   it's about the molecular changes that we want to invoke
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:26.500]   to get that body composition and the brain health
[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:30.840]   that allow us to be 80 or 90 and independently living.
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:32.040]   - And in terms of nutrition,
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:37.040]   you mentioned women should shoot for 1.1, 1.2 grams
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:40.980]   of quality protein per pound of body weight.
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:46.880]   What other types of foods do you like to see women ingesting?
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:49.560]   So are you a fan of fruit?
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.400]   - Yeah.
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.320]   - Great, well, these days you sort of have to ask
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:56.480]   in these circles, vegetables, fiber is important.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:02.240]   - And then in terms of starches to replace glycogen,
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.440]   especially if people are doing
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:05.320]   these high-intensity interval training sessions
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:10.040]   and the resistance training, what are your preferred sources?
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:12.120]   - Depends on who I'm working with.
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:15.800]   I have some people who love Cocoa Pops and kid cereal.
[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:17.960]   - Ooh, I cringe at that stuff,
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:20.440]   but I prefer rice and oatmeal
[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:22.840]   and I like a really good sourdough bread
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:24.320]   with butter or olive oil.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.160]   - Yeah.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:25.980]   - I'm guilty of that.
[02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:26.820]   - But there are some people
[02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:28.000]   who like the ultra-processed stuff.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.240]   So I'm like, okay, if you really, really need it,
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:32.560]   then you can put it on top of your yogurt
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.920]   after training as part of your carbohydrate uptake.
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:35.760]   It's the only time.
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.320]   - Because GLUT4 levels are so high,
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:39.040]   you're basically pulling everything into glycogen
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.080]   at that point anyway.
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:45.920]   - But ideally, carbs are all the different
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:47.560]   colorful fruit and veg.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:50.080]   And if we're looking at sweet potatoes
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.440]   or kumara if you're from other parts of the world,
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:56.240]   yams, all those kinds of things,
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:59.800]   sprouted bread, fantastic, quinoa, amaranth,
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.040]   all of those different types of things.
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:04.960]   It's just staying away from the ultra-processed.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:06.440]   And when we look at women,
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:09.760]   it's really important to have a very significant diversity
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:11.120]   in the gut microbiome.
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.200]   So we see there's a definitive decrease
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.320]   when we start to have hormonal shifts
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:18.520]   because of the way the gut bugs help deconjugate
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:20.400]   or unwrap some of our hormones
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.780]   and shoot them back out in the circulation.
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:26.720]   So as much fiber, colorful fruit and veg as you can,
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:28.920]   but also it's the 80/20 rule, right?
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:32.120]   80% of the time you're spot on, 20% is life
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:33.720]   'cause otherwise, where do we get our chocolate
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:35.240]   and our whiskey?
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.080]   - And there's some data that chocolate is good for us.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:38.920]   - It is.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.720]   - Especially the low sugar, dark chocolates.
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:43.920]   - I look at how it makes you feel, it makes you feel good.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:44.760]   - Right.
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:45.600]   - Yeah.
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:46.800]   - Yeah, one has to live.
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:47.920]   - Yeah.
[02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:51.120]   And fats, where do you like to see women
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:53.240]   get their fats from?
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:54.640]   - Again, I'll do a full disclosure.
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:58.240]   I have been vegan since I was in high school
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.520]   because of an incident of a field trip
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:03.640]   to a pig slaughterhouse and driving down the five,
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:05.440]   but that's my own preference.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.840]   So when we're looking at fats,
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:10.600]   it can be from a lot of different sources.
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:13.000]   I prefer women to have most their fats
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.480]   from plant-based stuff, not because I am plant-based,
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:17.600]   but because of the effect it has on the body.
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:20.880]   But there is a time and a place for animal fats too.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:24.440]   The whole fear mongering of saturated fatty acids
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:26.600]   from dairy has been disproven.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.800]   So if we're looking at what kinds of fats
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:30.240]   you want a conglomerate,
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:33.040]   but you want most of them to come from whole food,
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.960]   plant-based, not from ultra-processed.
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.200]   And then of course you're reaching for some real butter,
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:42.640]   you're reaching for some 4% fat yogurt
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:45.920]   or something like that to compliment your avocados,
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:48.280]   your nuts, your seeds, and your olive oils.
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:50.800]   - That all sounds very rational
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:52.720]   and delicious in my opinion.
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:54.760]   - Yeah, it's too common sense.
[02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:55.800]   People don't do it.
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:00.800]   - I think if people hear it from you, they'll do it.
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:02.240]   I think people just need to hear it
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:06.040]   in the context of a non-diet context.
[02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:07.760]   And you've done an amazing job today
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.040]   of explaining how nutrition fuels training,
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:13.040]   training fuels changes at the level of the muscle,
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:16.800]   the liver, et cetera, that allow one to ingest more fuel.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:18.400]   In fact, a lot of what I'm hearing
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:20.800]   is that women should probably ingest more quality fuels
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:23.160]   in order to offset these cortisol spikes
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:25.920]   and feel better while training and to train more,
[02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:27.560]   which everyone agrees,
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:30.000]   provided it's done properly is great for us.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.640]   Kind of a fun, hopefully fun question for you.
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:35.320]   If you had a magic wand
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:39.040]   and you could get all the women on earth now
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.920]   and going forward to make a change or changes,
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:44.400]   you don't have to pick just one,
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:46.520]   in terms of nutrition,
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:48.840]   how they think about their hormone cycle,
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:52.340]   exercise, health span, lifespan, what would it be?
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:56.600]   - I think I would have everyone understand
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:58.640]   their intrinsic selves
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:01.080]   because we have been inundated so much
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:05.160]   with sociocultural rhetoric and so much external noise
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:06.800]   that women have forgotten what it means
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:09.360]   to listen to themselves and their bodies.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.300]   I mean, that's the one thing
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:13.500]   that I have to reteach women to do so often.
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:15.640]   So if I could have a magic wand
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:17.800]   and have every woman understand
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:19.380]   what their bodies are saying
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:21.040]   and what their cycles are saying,
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.760]   and perimenopause is normal,
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:24.960]   everyone's gonna go through it
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:27.520]   if you have had a menstrual cycle,
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:30.560]   just to intrinsically understand what their body is,
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.400]   so then they have the tool
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.660]   to be able to implement external stressors
[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:36.460]   that's gonna be beneficial for them.
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:40.360]   - Well, Dr. Stacy Sims,
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:42.520]   this has been tremendously educational for me
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:45.800]   and I know for everybody listening and/or watching,
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:47.640]   you've taken us on an amazing tour
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:50.960]   of the best ways to train with cardiovascular training
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:52.900]   and resistance training,
[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:56.200]   those tailored specifically for women,
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:57.720]   as well as touching into some protocols
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:00.960]   for both men and women that are immensely powerful.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:02.560]   Talked a lot about the menstrual cycle.
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.760]   I get asked about the menstrual cycle
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:05.840]   and how it relates to training
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:08.160]   and vice versa so many times,
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:12.280]   and thank you for providing clear, actionable answers.
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:16.860]   And you've also educated us on caffeine supplements,
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:19.060]   including revealing some supplements
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:20.040]   that I didn't know existed,
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:23.400]   which is not a common occurrence for me.
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:24.240]   - Yay, I win.
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:27.520]   - And many wins, many, many wins, thanks to you,
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:28.400]   and on and on.
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:31.520]   So just such a rich data set here
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.740]   presented with such clarity and in an actionable way.
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:38.740]   So on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching,
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:40.480]   I just wanna say thank you.
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:41.960]   I know you've come a very long way
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:44.240]   from the other side of the equator, not just to see us,
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:47.080]   but given that your time is so precious
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:48.200]   that you've come to visit us
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:49.360]   and share with us your knowledge,
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.020]   I just wanna say a really deep, heartfelt thank you.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.040]   - Yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:54.880]   It's been fun.
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:56.040]   - Yeah, we'll have to have you back again.
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:57.360]   Maybe we'll come to New Zealand.
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:58.200]   - You should come down.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:59.520]   - All right. - Yeah, definitely.
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:00.360]   - Thank you.
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:02.400]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:03.920]   with Dr. Stacey Sims.

[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:34.440]   for the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:36.960]   please put those in the comments section on YouTube.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:38.800]   I do read all the comments.
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:39.940]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:41.140]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:42.760]   It's my very first book.
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.160]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:46.320]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:47.480]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:48.640]   for more than five years,
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:50.960]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:52.520]   of research and experience.
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:55.560]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:58.060]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:00.520]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.880]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:05.960]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:09.860]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:12.240]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:14.000]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.760]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:18.360]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.480]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:23.360]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.360]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:28.600]   Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:30.080]   And on all those platforms,
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:32.240]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:33.740]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:35.160]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:37.320]   but much of which is distinct from the contents
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.820]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:42.180]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:43.420]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:45.440]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:46.840]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:48.520]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.400]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:53.040]   as well as protocols in the form of brief PDFs
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:54.440]   of one to three pages,
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.320]   where I spell out the specific do's,
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:57.560]   and in some cases do nots,
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:59.520]   but mostly do's related to things like
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:01.120]   how to optimize your sleep,
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:03.160]   how to regulate your dopamine levels.
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:06.120]   There's a protocol for neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:08.280]   as well as protocols for fitness,
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:10.120]   which we call the Foundational Fitness Protocol,
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:12.620]   includes everything, sets, reps, cardiovascular training.
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:14.840]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:17.040]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:18.120]   go to the menu tab,
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.600]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide us your email.
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.680]   But I should point out,
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:23.900]   we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:25.220]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:27.900]   for today's discussion with Dr. Stacey Sims.
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:30.160]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:32.260]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:34.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:38.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
