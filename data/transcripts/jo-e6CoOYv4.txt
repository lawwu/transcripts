[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We have talked about jealousy in dating relationships.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   That was the main theme of episode 1177.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.720]   But we've never really talked about codependency in dating.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.520]   That theme is also important.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.880]   The question came in to us from a young man.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   No name was given.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.880]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.200]   Thank you for the APJ podcast.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   I have been in a relationship where my girlfriend has come to depend on me to what feels like
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.040]   an unhealthy extent.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.240]   She spends less and less time with her friends, even less and less time with her family, and
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.120]   increasingly relies on me as her sole relationship.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.480]   This does not seem healthy to me, is it?
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   And what should I do?"
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.960]   Even though this young man doesn't say so, I'm going to assume that part of what is behind
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.160]   this question is the prospect of marriage and the concern that this woman's excessive
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.920]   dependence on him might bode ill for what she would be like as a wife, as a partner
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.000]   for a lifetime.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.200]   Marriage is not an experiment.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.320]   It's a lifelong covenant.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.240]   It is good that the traditional wedding vows contain the phrase, "As long as we both
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.040]   shall live," or "Till death do us part."
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.360]   That kind of promise is biblically rooted.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360]   It's right.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   We should promise that at our wedding service.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.280]   So every man and woman who contemplates such a lifelong covenant should be looking for
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:55.480]   evidences of unshakable faith in Christ and deep roots of Christian character and strength.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:04.080]   Of course, no one is an infallible judge of faith and character, no one but God, which
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.440]   is why a Christian man and a Christian woman should be earnest in prayer that God would
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.680]   protect them from marrying someone who would destroy the marriage or who would make the
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.960]   relationship a dishonor to Christ.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.140]   So the young man who asked this question is putting his finger on the criteria that we
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.600]   should look for when dating someone who could become our spouse.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   He's putting his finger on what we might call this young woman's neediness.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.160]   Now I'm in no position to judge on the particular issue of this woman that he's talking about.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.680]   I know so little about her and so many factors can shape a person's behavior.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.800]   I would be foolish to pass any judgment on her.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.600]   So let me just speak generally about what he should be looking for, especially as it
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:17.360]   relates to spiritual or psychological neediness or what he's referring to, I think, as codependency.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.020]   I have five suggestions based on five passages of Scripture, and since it's a man who asked
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.900]   about a woman that he's dating, I'll state these suggestions in terms of the kind of
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.300]   woman that he should be looking for, even though in these five cases I think the same
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.780]   things apply to what a woman should be looking for in a man.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:52.640]   Number one, does she value Jesus and her relationship to Jesus as more precious than any other relationship
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   she has?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.220]   Philippians 3, 7, "Whatever gain I had, I counted as lost for the sake of Christ.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.060]   Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.220]   Jesus my Lord."
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.660]   This is the most important question.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.220]   Can you detect that you are number two in her life, not number one?
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:32.180]   Can you discern that she would rejoice to be number two in your life, not number one?
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:40.100]   If the supremacy of Christ is not firmly in place, nothing else in the relationship will
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.600]   be properly in place.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:53.720]   Number two, has Christ become so hope-giving and so stabilizing and so satisfying for her
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:02.880]   that you can see whether her strengths and her identity and her stability are undermined
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.240]   or not by low points and high points of her life?
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.440]   Philippians 4, 11, "Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.760]   situation I am to be content."
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.080]   Has she learned this?
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.760]   "I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.460]   and need.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.000]   I can do all things through him, namely Christ, who strengthens me."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.580]   Do you see this kind of inner strength coming from her faith in Christ so that she is functioning
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.480]   and fruitful as a person in the best of times and the worst of times?
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.360]   Number three, it is not unchristian.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:09.560]   I'll just admit this, it is not unchristian for a person to, in faith in Christ, feel
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.180]   the need for another person.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.460]   There is a biblical kind of need which is not the same as neediness.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:28.260]   Does she have the kind of need for you which is at root capable of honoring you, not using
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.260]   you?
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.780]   Now, here's where I'm getting that idea.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:41.220]   Consider the peculiar way that Paul argues in 1 Corinthians 12, 21 to 23.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.260]   In describing relationships between Christians in the body of Christ, he says this, "The
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:55.300]   eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have no need of you.'
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:04.180]   On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and on
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:11.420]   those parts of the body that we think are less honorable, we bestow the greater honor."
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:18.320]   In other words, he interprets the kind of need that a member of the body has for another
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.700]   member as a need which honors the other member.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.500]   That's really strange and wonderful.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.840]   That's a very unusual kind of need.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:41.620]   So the question for the young man is, is this young woman's need for him the kind of need
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.300]   that Paul's talking about?
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:52.380]   Does it have the capacity and the commitment not to consume him with neediness, but to
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.980]   confer on him honor?
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:04.180]   Number four, does she have the inner composure and resilience so that her joy in Christ is
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.740]   not ruined if she is rejected by other people?
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:19.100]   Luke 6:22, "Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.700]   on account of the Son of Man.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:31.860]   Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven."
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:37.300]   In other words, the reward is supposed to be so deep, so stabilizing, so satisfying
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.420]   that rejection by people does not undermine the joy.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:50.580]   Do you see evidence in her that she would respond the way Paul does in 1 Corinthians
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.580]   4.12?
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:09:01.140]   "When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat."
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:09.580]   Or do you see evidence that if she were treated that way, she would be emotionally incapacitated?
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:18.340]   Finally, number five, does she have some track record of the paradoxical Christian experience
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.540]   of sorrowful yet always rejoicing?
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:29.340]   2 Corinthians 6.10, Paul describes his own experience as sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:37.460]   In other words, no matter how real or painful the loss, the boulder of God's joy beneath
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.940]   the waves of the sorrow never moves.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:52.180]   So those five questions I would ask in trying to discern whether the emotional and relational
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:10:00.620]   dependence in a dating relationship is dysfunctional or unhealthy or codependent.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:09.180]   And if, as I can imagine, your response to these kinds of questions is to say, "Piper,
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.580]   nobody, nobody measures up to that standard."
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:22.980]   My response is, "To be sure, nobody is perfect in these five ways.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:34.340]   But a person who is truly born of God knows some measure of these things, has tasted them,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:43.140]   and does not shrink back from such questions, but really wants to grow in all these ways.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:51.980]   So look for this, and may God give you discernment in the second biggest decision of your life."
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.180]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.140]   And we have a dozen or so episodes in the archive right now on dating relationships.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.580]   You can check them out or send a follow-up question of your own.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:06.260]   You can do all that from our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.820]   And not to mention, we have many articles and books at the site too for those who are
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.820]   dating.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:11.860]   Check those out.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.860]   Well, do angels walk among us today?
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.860]   It's a classic Bible question, but one we haven't gotten to yet on the podcast.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   Until now, the question is about Hebrews 13.2.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.860]   That text says, "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.860]   angels unawares."
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.860]   So do angels walk among us today?
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.860]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.860]   We will see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.860]   Have a great weekend.
