[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   today on Grace To You. If you're going to show that the gospel transformed you,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.920]   you can't be a rebellious wife. There's the assumption that something in Christ is now
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.580]   possible that apart from Christ was not possible or not like.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.960]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.460]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.680]   Well, this morning we come to Ephesians 5 and the subject of marriage.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:11.060]   And this is going to be a very politically incorrect experience for all of you. Some
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.200]   of you need a seat belt because at some point you're going to feel like you need to get out of
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.740]   here and avoid any more of this offense. But it's critical that we understand
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.960]   that we need to get out of here. And I'm going to show you a little bit of a story.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.060]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. I'm going to show you a little bit of a story.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.160]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. I'm going to show you a little bit of a story.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.200]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. I'm going to show you a little bit of a story.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.240]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. I'm going to show you a little bit of a story.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. Exactly what our Lord is
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.920]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. Exactly what our Lord is
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.540]   I'm going to show you a little bit of a story. Exactly what our Lord is conveying to us with regard to
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   Exactly what our Lord is conveying to us with regard to
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620]   Exactly what our Lord is conveying to us with regard to living the Christian life. So let me
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.680]   conveying to us with regard to living the Christian life. So let me
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.540]   conveying to us with regard to living the Christian life. So let me begin reading this portion of
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.580]   living the Christian life. So let me begin reading this portion of
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.760]   living the Christian life. So let me begin reading this portion of Scripture at verse 18, Ephesians 5:18.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.820]   begin reading this portion of Scripture at verse 18, Ephesians 5:18.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.940]   I'll read down to the end of the chapter. "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.540]   dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns,
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.420]   and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord,
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.460]   always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God,
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.700]   even the Father. And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives, be subject to your own
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.580]   husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.780]   the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ,
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.580]   so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.940]   "Husbands,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.340]   love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.580]   so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word,
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.420]   that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.140]   or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought to
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.700]   also love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself,
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.420]   for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.100]   church, because we are members of His body. For this reason a man shall leave his father
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.420]   and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.740]   This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.140]   Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself,
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.380]   and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.660]   Now, I understand in the culture in which we live the outright offense of a portion of Scripture
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.500]   like this. We are living in a culture that is making a complete effort to destroy men,
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.660]   to destroy women, to destroy children, to destroy families, to destroy marriage. This
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.060]   is an all-out, massive assault. So this is going to sound like it came from an alien universe,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.820]   and in fact it did. It comes from heaven to us. And I want to talk about the duty of the wife,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.060]   and let's begin with the matter of submission, the matter of submission.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.180]   Notice it doesn't say, "Wives, obey your husbands." That's for children, chapter 6, verse 1,
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:41.540]   that's for slaves, chapter 6, verse 5, obedience. This is a softer word, "Be subject to your own
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:51.620]   husbands." And to soften it even further, "Subject to your own husbands." There's a sense in which
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.980]   you own your husband. He belongs to you, which then,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.860]   obviously, connects the fact that it benefits you to treat your husband the way God wants you to
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.180]   treat your husband, because there will be divine blessing following that.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.420]   So this is more intimate than obedience. This is more personal,
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:29.220]   more tender, more inward, more vital, more loving, your own husband. This is not about inferiority in
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.220]   any sense. But as simple as the command is, it's kind of hard to get women to do this all the time.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.460]   And I'm not picking on them. It's hard for men to be what they ought to be,
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.900]   but it's hard for women to be what they ought to be. We're all caught up in the fall, right?
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.220]   So we're struggling to be what the Lord wants us to be. But I want to take you back to Genesis,
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.700]   chapter 3 and verse 16, because I want you to know where this tendency toward rebellion comes from.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.460]   So if you are a woman and you feel like your husband irritates you, and you just don't feel
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:11.380]   like always complying with what he wants, you came by this basically because of Eve.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:20.100]   She did this to the women, and Adam followed suit. But back in Genesis 3, when Adam and Eve had sinned,
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.660]   God cursed the women, women in general. Verse 16 of Genesis 3, "The women," he said, "I will greatly
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.260]   multiply your pain in childhood."
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.100]   "Pain in childbirth." Is that true? Is that a reality? Of course, every woman who's ever had a
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.260]   child affirms that. So that's a validation of Scripture. Yes, that's true. "In pain,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.020]   you will bring forth children." And then there's a second part of it:
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.980]   "Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you." Now, what does that mean,
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.780]   "Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you"? That exact statement appears
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:12.020]   in chapter 4, verse 7, exact same Hebrew statement. Chapter 4, verse 7 is talking about sin,
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.100]   and it says in verse 7, middle of the verse, "Sin is crouching at the door,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:27.300]   and its desire is for you, but you must master it." It's the same phrase. Whatever sin wants
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:35.620]   to do is what the woman wants to do. It's not a desire that's physical. It's not a desire for
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.100]   intimacy that's being referred to here. It's a desire to overthrow. It's a desire to dominate.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.900]   That's what sin wants to do. "And you must master it." That's what the Lord said to Cain.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:56.820]   "You can't let sin master you. You must master it. Its desire is to overpower you." Same exact
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:05.140]   phrase speaking of women. "The desire for women will be to overpower the man, and he must rule
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:12.980]   over you." Well, that leads to rebellion in a marriage and even a kind of hostility
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:19.540]   on the part of the husband who is struggling to rule. That's the conflict in marriage. You have
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.340]   women innately in their fallenness not wanting to submit, and you have men in their fallenness wanting to die.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.380]   You have women wanting to dominate, and that's the battle of the sexes as it's known. But I want you
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.060]   to understand that that's all basically in the book of Genesis that is to be expected.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:47.140]   So in the woman submitting to her husband, there's the assumption that something in Christ is now
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:55.860]   possible that apart from Christ was not possible or not likely. You can do this now because of the
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:03.380]   indwelling Holy Spirit, because of the transformation of your life. And Colossians 3:18 says this:
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:10.180]   "Wives, be subject to your husbands." It's the same thing there. "Be subject to your husbands."
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:18.980]   Why is this? Why does it have to be this way? Well, by God's design. God has designed men and women
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:25.380]   differently, and of course this culture wants to overthrow all of that with a level of insanity that shocks us all.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:32.660]   But the headship of the man is built around this notion, and this is how you have to look at it: not
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:41.220]   smarter, not wiser, not more experienced, not more insightful, not more spiritual, not more valuable.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:52.420]   It is simply that God designed men to be physically stronger, constitutionally designed by God to work,
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.900]   to protect,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:03.460]   to provide for, to secure the wife whom the Holy Spirit calls in 1 Peter 3:7 the weaker vessel.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:09.860]   Not weaker intellectually, not weaker mentally, not weaker in wisdom or any virtue at all, but
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:17.780]   merely by God's design. And we get that. That's why there's such a furor when men want to participate
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:24.420]   in women's sports. Anybody gets that. It's obviously not a possible compatibility, but it's
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:32.420]   not a possibility because men have a completely different system that makes them stronger than women.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:41.300]   It's really nothing more than that. And so by divine design, Colossians 3:18 says, "It is
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:50.180]   fitting. It is fitting. It has always been this way. It's an imperfect, active, indicative. It's
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.220]   always been like this. It's always been this way."
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:02.100]   that men have been designed by God to be the providers, the protectors of women.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.520]   And you see that in 1 Timothy 2.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:11.420]   Look at 1 Timothy 2:11: "A woman must receive instruction with entire submissiveness."
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.860]   This is talking about the church.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:18.020]   "I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man but remain quiet."
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.100]   In the life of the church, there's no place for women preachers.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.160]   Women can teach women, of course.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.920]   Women can teach children.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.060]   We're going to look at Titus 2 in a minute, and women are instructed to teach women, but
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.220]   not to preach in the church.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.520]   Verse 12: "I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man but to remain
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   quiet."
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.700]   Is this cultural?
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.700]   No.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.820]   Verse 13: "It was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:51.160]   It was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression."
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.100]   Women need the presence of God.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.980]   It was the protection and the provision and the shelter of a strong man.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:03.860]   It was because Satan got Eve out from under Adam that she was deceived.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.060]   Adam was not deceived.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.180]   He was not deceived.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.660]   He bears the culpability for leading the race into sin, but he was not deceived.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.600]   The woman was deceived.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.020]   A remarkable illustration of the fact that women need the protection that men can provide
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.560]   for them.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.100]   But unless you think that's true, you're wrong.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.000]   I don't think that that makes women second class.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.280]   Verse 15 says, "But women will be preserved or saved or delivered" - from what?
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.960]   - "from second class status."
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.040]   How?
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.960]   "Through the bearing of children, if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   self-restraint."
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:48.240]   Ask yourself this question: When you think about a godly child who grows up to love the
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.100]   Lord Jesus Christ, would you assume that?
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.380]   That the greatest impression made upon that child was its father or mother?
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:04.840]   Most likely it is the mother that comes to mind, because the mother who suckles that
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.800]   child, who nurses that child, the mother who cares for that little child, has the most
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.660]   intimate relationship with that child.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.340]   That balances off the male authority.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:20.100]   I mean, it's the NFL commercial, "Hi, Mom, never Hi, Dad," right?
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   No matter how...
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.080]   No matter how much gratitude you might have for your father, it's not the same as the
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.500]   gratitude you have for a godly mother who raised you in faith and love and sanctity.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.980]   And it says, "She will be saved through the bearing of children."
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.920]   Now there's been some confusion about that.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:43.060]   I was in Romania some years ago with a pastor's conference in a packed church in Bucharest,
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.280]   and they were having a Q&A, and one of the questions was, "What does that verse mean,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.420]   'Women will be saved through the bearing of children?'
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.100]   What does that mean?"
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:59.780]   And I was ignorant of the circumstances, so I just popped into a simple answer.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:06.620]   "Well, it certainly does not mean your soul is saved if you have a baby.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.740]   That's not possible because you're saved by grace through faith in Christ.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.060]   So it can't mean that.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.220]   It can't have anything to do with your salvation."
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.100]   And the translator translated that, and the room just went dead still.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:29.840]   I knew something was up, and the man who was trying to help me with this leaned over
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:36.520]   and said, "That was a blow that you wouldn't understand.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:43.460]   These people have been taught for years that if you do anything to prevent a pregnancy,
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.860]   you'll lose your salvation based on that verse."
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.100]   Yeah, if you do anything to prevent any normal thing.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.640]   Unless you want to get pregnant all the time, anything you do to avoid a pregnancy, you
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.420]   lose your salvation based on that verse.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.520]   And so I said, "Well, I need to say more then."
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:10.860]   So I doubled down on it, and I explained in detail that's not what it meant, and you couldn't
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:17.420]   lose your salvation anyway, certainly not because you decided not to get pregnant.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.100]   And by the time I got done with the explanation, you could see these women.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.340]   These pastor's wives who had between 12 and 16 children.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.720]   Yeah, looking at their husband and say, "So you had to be wrong about that verse?"
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:41.160]   I mean, couldn't you just get baptism wrong?
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:50.100]   "What have you done to me?"
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.100]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:59.680]   It means a woman is saved from any thought of second-class status by the fact that she
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:07.720]   bears the children, and she influences them in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.760]   Now I want to show you another passage as we move toward the end, Titus, chapter 2.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:22.100]   And we're still talking about the matter of submission and how consistent Scripture is.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.100]   And I want to show you another passage as we move toward the end, Titus, chapter 2.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.920]   It's talking about things that are proper, things that fit sound doctrine.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:38.780]   And among them is a word to the women in verse 3 to 5: "Older women likewise are to be reverent
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:46.940]   in their behavior, not malicious gossips, nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.940]   good."
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.100]   So yes, is there a place for women teaching in the church?
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.100]   Of course.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.460]   "They are to be reverent in their behavior and teaching what is good, so that they may
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.440]   encourage the young women."
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   So older women teach the young women to do what?
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:10.700]   To love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, pure workers at home, kind,
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.720]   being subject to their own husbands, so that the Word of God will not be dishonored.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.880]   And again, it comes back to what kind of testimony you give.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.100]   If you're going to show that the gospel transcends.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.100]   If you're going to show that the gospel transcends.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.100]   If you're going to show that the gospel transcends.

[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100]   If you're going to show that the gospel transcends.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100]   If you're going to show that the gospel transcends.
