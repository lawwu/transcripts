[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.860]   That was intense.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.080]   This video is a Judo training session with Travis Stevens from a while back.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.320]   He's a 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo and one of the greatest American Jidoka ever.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.000]   I've trained Judo and Jiu-Jitsu for many years and took some time off on the Judo side, focusing
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.080]   more on submission grappling than throwing.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.640]   But I'm hoping to get back into it with Jimmy Pedro, the legendary Judo coach out in Boston.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.240]   I love Judo too much.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.480]   I miss it.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.280]   Big thank you to Craig Jones and the B Team for letting us use their gym for this Judo
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.480]   session and I should also say that Austin in general is amazing for martial arts.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.200]   We've got 10th Planet with Gabe Tuttle, New Wave with John Donahart, Gordon Ryan, Nicholas
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.920]   Maragalli and others, B Team with Craig Jones, Nicky Rod, Nicky Ryan and others, and many
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   more.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.320]   I highly recommend you check out these places and who knows, maybe you'll see me there and
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.600]   we'll get a chance to train.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.440]   And now, dear friends, here's the 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo, Travis Stevens.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.160]   I've been a fan of yours for a long time.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.800]   Thank you for talking a little Judo with me today, man.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   Spread the knowledge.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   Here we go.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.160]   I'm going to make you go up and then I'm going to go under and then put you on your back
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   right where you're standing.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160]   That's the idea.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.480]   But I actually don't have to do much lifting, so when I come down and I split, I hold tight,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.400]   I get a strong pull, and when I back up, now you're right where you were standing.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.560]   The fundamental movement here is the splitting either the hips or you're doing like some
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560]   leg to the outside.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.920]   You always just got really good at doing this step and generating power from it where when
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.300]   I kick, I press it hard enough where I'm not overextending this leg and this moves.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.760]   What a lot of people try to do is they go here and they overcommit and obviously can't
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.080]   take that step.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.320]   I try to hike and let that slide into place naturally.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   It's important that the angle is here instead of straight on unless you're going to get
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.360]   me to turn and give you that angle.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.400]   It's very difficult for you if you take a grip here on the side and then you were to
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.080]   try to come in and split my legs right there.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.480]   You see how I can start to slide and there's a gap on this side.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.040]   A lot of times when I do this, people slip off to this side and you end up missing it.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   If I change your angle to here, now come in.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   See how you got my hip and so you're not worried about coming around because the second I try
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.160]   to lift and jump over, that leg will be sliding back and that's going to if I try to step
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.960]   over, my weight's going up.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.920]   When you back up, you're going to amplify that.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.100]   This is a dream come true by the way.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.040]   You're known for this interesting variation, which is the Seinagi throw where you grab
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   the lapel.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.720]   Can you explain how that works?
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.340]   In a basic sense, you're going to take a grip here.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.040]   Don't get pushed, like resist there and then this happens.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.080]   I get that back and forth push so that it's effortless on my front leg so that there.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.140]   See how you can actually get pulled through when I slip the pressure.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.640]   That's the basics of it.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.520]   Now I have to get you to a point where you can't sprawl and lower your center of gravity.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.120]   What I do for that is when I lower that weight and I lift that weight, I hold it.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.480]   That way when you pop up on your toes, the hand at the top of the arc holds you while
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.200]   I slip underneath and then I can catch you on my hips.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.120]   So I've got to get there before you get lower than I do.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.520]   And then you're doing this big.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.160]   Yes, so typically if I find my point at the center, my foot starts there and then I replace
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.760]   and I slip and then we come back up.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.280]   If you're gripping and I'm holding your hand, which sometimes I do, if I press you at some
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.160]   point, see how I'm getting you to stand up?
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   That leg is light.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   Now I can come back through.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.280]   Yes, but I press them until they press back hard enough where we go from this angle to
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.520]   up and then I can slide on the legs.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.880]   And let's say like, right, I can't attack because this leg is in front.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.640]   I also, if you have a good stable position, I can't necessarily move that foot, but you're
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.040]   off balance point is here at the front and there at the rear.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.840]   So if I take my pinky and I hit that point, you're going to turn and face me.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   Thank you.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.080]   Now it's not in front anymore.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.200]   So I didn't, I never had to move it.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.080]   So when you're in this position, go ahead and move off of that and then knock me to
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   that front position, wait, the second you see me starting to rotate, add to that.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   There we go.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   There you go.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   And then I don't feel the weight.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:31.120]   Thank you, brother.
