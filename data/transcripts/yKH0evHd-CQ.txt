[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Cal, I'm a Benedictine monk in Missouri. I have a disagreement with a part of your deep life stack
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.200]   Discipline is not an identity per se but rather a tool for developing and solidifying an identity
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.440]   You use value as a criteria for leading a meaningful and purposeful life shaped through code ritual and routine
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.840]   You readily assert that you need discipline for a value to take hold but discipline needs a reason
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.880]   Yeah, it's a good question
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.760]   I you know, I get this debate a lot is I think it's one of the more unique and controversial aspects of my conception of
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.680]   Cultivating a deep life where I say discipline comes first
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.800]   No, it's Ian here disagrees part of this is semantic. I
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.380]   Think discipline is an an overloaded word. We have a lot of connotations with it often
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.160]   negative
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.200]   We think about discipline sometimes as something being enforced upon us
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   The cruel headmaster disciplining the kids. We also have connotations with discipline with those who are
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.360]   Idolizing making a false god out of discipline itself
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.240]   where we have my all that matters is the
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.040]   Discipline of what I do and the harder things I do and other people won't do these things this hard and all of my self-worth
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   just comes entirely from
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   my discipline this is the sort of
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680]   David Goggins
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.840]   style philosophy of sort of building your identity around
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.720]   Extreme feats of discipline. This was an idea that was really big and supported by Instagram culture sort of over the last decade
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   So it's an overloaded term. So let's let's use a different term just for this conversation
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.040]   efficaciousness
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   So efficaciousness describes the degree to which you believe yourself able to actually
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.600]   Take action towards goals. If you're an efficacious person you say yes in general
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.880]   I am someone who if I have something I want to do and it's reasonable I can do it
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   I can figure out how to do it
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.640]   my argument having spent a lot of time with people who are trying to turn around their lives is that
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.560]   That is missing a lot of times and if that is missing nothing else works
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.800]   even trying to determine what your values are and
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.000]   Believing that you can build your life around those values even that seemingly fundamental decision
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.880]   lays on a foundation of efficaciousness
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.800]   If you do not see yourself as someone who can take action towards important things
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.640]   Even if it's not obligated and even if it's hard if you do not see yourself as a person who can do that
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.540]   Almost any other self developmental activity is going to be derailed. It's going to dissipate before it actually takes hold
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.820]   Now there's other people and probably a ton. I mean you're you're a Benedictine monk
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.580]   So you're probably an exemplar of this other type of person where they just have the strong sense of efficaciousness
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.700]   And so what matters like right off the bat then is like, okay
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.140]   Let me figure out my values and build my life around it
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.540]   But most people the average person stumbles before they get there. So when I say discipline is an identity what I don't mean is
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.220]   What matters is that you build your identity around discipline?
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.900]   That you become David Goggins or Cameron Haynes that like how you define yourself and your value is through your discipline and I agree with
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.140]   You fully there at team that that's not
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.220]   That's false idol. That's not going to get you there
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.540]   But on the other hand, I think until you have built a minor foundation of efficaciousness
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.300]   Your efforts are likely going to be wasted the average person's efforts are likely going to be wasted
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.060]   So that's why I put discipline first. You have to just start by convincing yourself
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.980]   I can do things and there's an excitement and a motivation and a clarity and a drive that comes out of that that when you then
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.980]   Say, okay. So what do I care about?
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.060]   You actually care about that question and
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.820]   You take it more seriously and the answers actually stick
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.900]   I'm so kind of convinced about this foundational idea that I've been recently playing around with my deep life stack and
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   One of the configurations I've been playing around with more recently actually has a much clearer division
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.820]   between laying the foundations and
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.220]   Then cultivating depth now and I'm not this is very early stages. I'm just throwing out ideas here
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.140]   But one of the reconfigurations I've been playing with in my notebooks recently is one where it's not just discipline comes first
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.300]   But maybe we're gonna do discipline control and maybe even throw in something like craft
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.900]   So first of all, how do I convince myself? I'm efficacious second of all
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.340]   How do I just take control of all the stuff in my life learn how to have control over what's on my plate and how?
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.020]   It's going to get done and and how to take things off of my plate
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.580]   And maybe throw in their craft. Okay. Now, let me teach
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.340]   Let me take this out for a spin and show myself that I can actually get good at something
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.580]   When I set my mind to it and almost seeing that in this new configuration, I'm playing with that's the foundation
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.100]   Now with that foundation set let's get serious about that and that's step two now. It's okay. What do I what do I really value?
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.100]   Now I'm ready to tackle that question seriously
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.140]   Sacrifice how am I sacrificing my time and attention on behalf of other people?
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.580]   Community around me people I care about let's get serious about that
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.540]   there's no meaning without that and then finally escape or remark ability then now, how do I
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.660]   Leave my legacy. How do I create the remarkable aspects of my life built around these values?
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.700]   I mean I'm almost seeing now is like a very clear separation where there's this long process of just becoming to borrow a term from
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.780]   Jocko an exceptionally capable human being
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.740]   And then once you do that you say now I could become an exceptionally deep human being and I think when we sometimes swap these
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.600]   Things around it's not successful for people some people it is but I think a lot of people starting with the depth before they have the capability
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.400]   Leads to a lot of self recrimination and dissipation. It might lead people to believe I'm just not able to do this
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   I'm just fundamentally a broken person. I
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.340]   I'm trying to like build my life around values. I can't identify him. I don't trust the values
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.080]   I pick it can almost be harmful if you jump right to the cultivating depth before you've done the
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.360]   Boring hard work of becoming a capable human being in the first place
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360]   So, I don't know I'm still playing with these thoughts of teen so I'd like the excuse
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.660]   To just discuss and get some more feedback and I love this type of feedback
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.900]   But that's a little bit of an insight into how I've been thinking about this recently
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.340]   All right, let's do one more question before we do our live call-in case study which I'm excited about
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.080]   Sounds good next questions from Yalan. Hi Cal until three years ago. I used to be a deep life person
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.180]   I had a schedule for each day. I studied a lot slept
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.340]   Well, my phone was on airplane or silent mode for most of the day the usual stuff
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.500]   But since then I've been losing my charm
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.580]   I'm having a really hard time making time for studying or even reading
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.760]   I almost never plan anything ahead anymore and I've been seriously addicted to video games
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.100]   I'm an English teacher and I have my obligations, but I never do anything beyond the
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.380]   Obligatory area what's more being a teacher in Israel makes you become hooked on your phone because there are so many
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.800]   Notifications updates regarding what's going on with the school. You have to be aware of what's going on
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.200]   I want to get back on track and it feels extremely hard and sometimes even impossible
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.160]   You know, just what's interesting about that is a couple nights ago
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.580]   I was giving a talk up at my kids school about
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.560]   Smartphones and kids and social media and kids and I was talking to a family afterwards who just moved here from Israel
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.960]   And they actually had the same point. They said, you know in in Israel the phone culture is like inescapable
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.280]   And they said here they actually felt like so their kid their middle schooler had a phone and everything said in Israel like everything is built
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.440]   around like whatsapp
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:35.080]   Notifications and how the schools operate and everything is built around the phone for all these various different reasons and here it feels like it's possible
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.080]   Not to do that. And so they were wondering can we pull it back?
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.320]   We had that, you know, so it's interesting something about Israel
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.840]   Did you read that on New Yorker article like last month about the Chinese school and like all the what's app and how there's a thousand?
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.240]   Messages day for the parents. Yeah, I was like completely overwhelmed like the same thing. Yeah. Yeah
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.120]   So I think cultural differences and tech patterns is an interesting one, but to get back to the bigger issue here
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.240]   I think this goes right back to the question with the Benedictine monk that we just answered
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.920]   So what we see here is kind of the opposite
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.560]   so so the the Benedictine monk, this is basically what I mean here is this is sort of
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:17.240]   What's the right way to put this Yalan I believe has done the become a capable person piece
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.860]   Of the deep life stack you as he talks about he previously
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.640]   Had it all dialed in he's organized
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.480]   He has control over his time and activities and schedules and is careful about how he uses his tools
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.880]   But then he stopped before getting to the stuff that he Tom the Benedictine monk said is important
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.160]   To figuring out your values your vision for your legacy and purpose on earth building your life around that
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.840]   So this is a really interesting point because what it shows is if you just do the first part in my plan
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.120]   Which is like you got to be capable before you can really figure out how to be deep if you just do the capable part
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.840]   You don't know that's going to stick
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.320]   so what happened here you did the capable part and your mind is basically the what purpose and
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.920]   So you began escaping back in the video games and found sort of the capability stuff starting to
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.000]   dissipate again
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.920]   So Yalan what you need to do is keep moving up the deep life stack
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:20.000]   So once you regain, you know how to do this, so just get back to like, okay intentional multi-scale planning careful about my tools
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.740]   Great. Now, you got to keep moving up the stack. Now, you got to get really engaged on your values
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:31.720]   What's my code? What are the rituals I use to remind myself of the value of this code on a regular basis?
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.680]   What is this this vision on which I'm going to build my my lifestyle my purpose on earth?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.120]   Maybe then throw in some sacrifice if you're not
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.040]   Sacrificing non-trivial time and attention on behalf of other people. You're not going to feel fully alive as a human
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.400]   So you're a teacher
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.360]   So there's many ways for you to reintegrate this into your life
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.400]   And then finally you have this sort of escape or mark ability legacy piece where you have some ambitious plans
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.160]   That you put into your life that are meant that are meant to actually
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.100]   Take these things you care about and push them to new extremes and now you're working towards something your
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:13.800]   Capability your ability to be organized on top of things is being deployed towards something that's important to you. I think that's what's missing
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.240]   So in the last question I said if you just do the second part but not the first part
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.980]   That's a problem because it's very hard to actually seek depth and sacrifice and have these legacy building projects if you're not a capable human
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.320]   But we're seeing here is if you just do the first part that's not enough either
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.320]   You're being productive for the sake of being productive is eventually going to probably be something that is not fulfilling
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.640]   So we got to see both sides of the stack
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.880]   Neither of them can act in isolation. You need both of them
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.000]   So you'll on I'm glad glad to give me a chance to talk about that. Hey, if you like this video
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.360]   I think you'll really like this one as well. Check it out
