[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   A listener to the podcast named Travis in Turlock, California writes in with a really
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040]   good question.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040]   Here it is, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.660]   "There are Scripture passages like Hebrews 2.11 and Romans 8.29 that speak of Jesus as
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.320]   our brother.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.600]   There seem to be some opinions on how we might interpret this.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200]   So my question to you is this.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.860]   In what sense is Jesus my brother, and how does the brotherhood of Jesus add weight and
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.040]   wonder and affection to our worship?"
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.240]   Well I love the way that question is framed.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:45.660]   How does the brotherhood of Jesus to us add weight and wonder and affection to our worship?
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.240]   That's exactly the right question.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.680]   Oh, that all of our questions were framed that way.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.800]   I am sure that my thoughts about this are utterly inadequate to the greatness of the
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.160]   Son of God being my brother.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:16.800]   I mean, that is such a staggering thought that what I'm about to say feels to me inadequate.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.200]   But he asked, we have a Bible, God doesn't give us the legitimacy of staying silent.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.280]   So Travis mentioned—I'm going to look at maybe two or three texts and see if I can
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.160]   just let these texts do the work.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.720]   Travis mentioned Hebrews 2.11, so let's read it and maybe verses 10 and 11 together because
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   I think the key is in the way verse 11 relates to verse 10.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.520]   For it was fitting, it was fitting that he, this is God the Father, for whom and by whom
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.720]   all things exist in bringing many sons to glory should make the founder.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   So it was fitting that he should make the founder, that's Jesus, it's fitting that
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.840]   he should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:14.680]   So God thought it fitting, suitable, appropriate, beautiful to complete, to make perfect the
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.040]   beauty of Christ through suffering, and here comes the ground.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.880]   Because verse 11, because he who sanctifies, we know that's Jesus because of the way
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.680]   chapter 13.12 refers to the he who sanctifies.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   For Jesus, he who sanctifies, and those who are sanctified, his emerging sons of God and
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.560]   brothers are all of one.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.440]   That's difficult to know what that refers to, but it could be all of one Father or all
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.080]   of one human nature, all of one.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.240]   That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:09.200]   So he's not ashamed to call us brothers because in bringing us to sanctification through Jesus'
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.000]   death for us, which was fitting in bringing many sons to glory, therefore he's not ashamed
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.160]   to call us brothers.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   So the writer is giving a reason for why it was fitting that Christ lead many sons to
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.480]   glory through sufferings.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:38.840]   And one great aim of God in salvation is that he have a great unified family of children
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   with Jesus Christ being both essentially different from and yet deeply united to his other human
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.760]   brothers and sisters, both really different and really like.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.160]   But if all the brothers and sisters in the family have experienced suffering except one,
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.200]   then the unity is jeopardized, and so for the sake of a common spirit of unity and sympathy
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:21.060]   and camaraderie even in suffering, Christ takes on human nature and he leads many sons
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.840]   to glory and into his brotherhood through suffering and death.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.960]   In other words, the reason it's fitting for Christ to suffer to lead many sons to glory
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   and many brothers into brotherhood to glory is that this suffering expresses his being
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.480]   a good, beautiful comrade, brother.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:56.280]   All of this hangs on God's aim to create a family that's so unified and so deeply interwoven
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.200]   and empathetic that the family would be jeopardized, would be undermined if the perfect oldest
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.080]   brother does not go through all the pain of the rest of the children.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   So to answer Travis's question, what adds weight and wonder and affection to our worship
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:29.720]   of Christ is that it's the combination of the exalted uniqueness of Jesus as the Son
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:39.560]   of God, the Son of God, on the one hand, and his utter condescension to share our nature
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:49.800]   as humans and our suffering as fallen, mortal, all so that he could be included and we could
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   be included in the divine family with Christ as the ever-exalted and superior, unique,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.000]   divine older brother.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.920]   That's my best shot at Hebrews 2.11, and it is a glorious picture.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.320]   And here's Romans 8.29, which he also mentioned, and I think it's essentially the same argument.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.160]   He says, "For those whom he, God, foreknew, he predestined to be conformed to the image
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.280]   of his Son in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.840]   Now there's a double purpose there, a double purpose of God in predestination.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.280]   One is conformity to the image of the Son of God so that we can actually be called brothers
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   because of this unity, this conformity, this union with Christ.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.800]   We're brothers by likeness, not just legally, but by likeness to his image.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.520]   But the stress also falls on the fact that Jesus is the firstborn among the brothers,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.880]   and that term "firstborn" should probably have here the complete weight that it had
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   in the Old Testament, like Psalm 89.27, where it says, "And I will make him the firstborn,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.600]   the highest of the kings of the earth."
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.520]   That's not a small word in Paul's vocabulary.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:28.320]   So the reason this gives weight and wonder to our worship of the Son is, again, the combination
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.600]   of oneness with us as we are conformed to his image and difference from us in being
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.840]   the firstborn in the fullest sense of the highest of the kings of the earth.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   Our elder brother is one with us and yet infinitely above us, and it's the conjunction of those
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:58.600]   two things that is peculiar—I like to say the peculiar glory—that we worship.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.840]   And if we let ourselves linger in Romans 8 for just a bit, we'll remember in verses
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:15.180]   16 and 17 that being a brother of Christ means being a fellow heir with him.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.240]   So Paul says, "The Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   God, and if children, then heirs," and then he adds, "fellow heirs with Christ."
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.480]   That's what brothers are.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.600]   They are fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.840]   Now that is simply breathtaking for us poor, weak, sinful, ignorant humans.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:47.960]   Fellow heirs with the Son of God because we're in the family by the Spirit of adoption.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.280]   What's a state that we inherit with Jesus is the universe.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.640]   It's everything that exists except God.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:04.880]   And the implications of this is a weight of worship that should make us humble, joyful
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   worshipers on Sunday and should make us the most free from materialism.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.400]   We own everything by inheritance, free from materialism, radical lives of love.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.280]   And maybe one last text because I love this one.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.200]   I preached a sermon one time called "How to Become the Mother of Jesus," and I could
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.760]   have preached on how to be the brother of Jesus because they're both in the same text.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.520]   Mark 3, 32 to 35, there was a crowd around Jesus and they said, "Hey, your mother and
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.280]   your brothers are outside seeking you."
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.880]   In other words, the people that are closest to you, that seem to have the closest human
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.040]   ties, they want to talk to you.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.840]   Now Jesus' answer is simply stunning.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.760]   He says, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.000]   And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   brothers.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.280]   For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.440]   So how to be the mother of Jesus is to obey God, and you'll be the mother of Jesus.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.120]   Well, what does that mean?
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.880]   Be the mother or sister or brother of Jesus?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.480]   It doesn't mean you'll be as close to him as you can get.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.800]   Your intimacy of relationship will be very, very, very close.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.920]   There will be privilege, there will be access, there'll be protection.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.800]   It's wonderful to have a big brother who's strong when you're getting in a fight on the
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.920]   playground.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.120]   It's wonderful if you're watching your son die to have him care for you and put John
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.800]   in charge of you because he's a good caregiver to his mother.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   You want Jesus to be a good caregiver to you?
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.200]   Then become the mother or the brother of Jesus by obeying the will of God.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:59.680]   So weight and wonder, like Travis says, the weight and the wonder of our worship of Jesus
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:07.420]   is always a mingling of trembling reverence at the unique divine greatness of the one
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:16.240]   who is and the unspeakable loneliness that unites him to us in a shared human nature
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.120]   and suffering and amazingly intimate friendship.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.000]   Marvelous implications here, Pastor John.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.880]   Thank you for unpacking these loaded passages on this precious truth.

[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.520]   when it comes to the hardening of our hearts and the softening of our hearts, what can
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.660]   we do to make our own hearts softer?
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.000]   Is there anything we can do?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And if so, what is it?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Friday.
