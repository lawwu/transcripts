[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780]   All right, so Jesse, I was thinking about trying a new segment.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.580]   It's named, I mean, it's an old name.
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.600]   We used to call Thursday episodes this, but I was thinking about calling the segment Habit
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.220]   Tune Up.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.640]   And the idea was I just take a piece of advice from the types of advice I give and just get
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   into it a little bit.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.700]   So let's just take a piece of, take of advice out of my toolkit and get into it a little
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.720]   bit even without a question to prompt it.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.560]   So we're going to give that a try.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.640]   Today's Habit Tune Up is going to be about one of my longest running productivity strategies.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   So in terms of strategies that I have run in my own life, this is pretty high up on
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.500]   the list of things I've been doing for the longest amount of time, and that is fixed
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.040]   schedule productivity.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.060]   All right, so what is fixed schedule productivity?
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.040]   It's a simple idea where it says you fix the hours that you want to work.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.540]   So like on a typical day, here's the length I want for my work day.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.480]   And then you work backwards and do what you have to do to make the work actually fit.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.380]   So that's primary fixed schedule productivity.
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.080]   I work 830 to 430.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.080]   I work nine to five.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.080]   I work eight to six.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   You fix the hours and say, that is my line in the sand.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.360]   Now I have to do what I can to make that fit.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.600]   There's then secondary fixed schedule productivity, which is where you take specific types of
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.780]   work you do on a recurring basis and give that an even smaller boundary.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.280]   In our life, my biggest example of that is probably this podcast.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.080]   It exists for me in a half day.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.640]   It gets a half day per week.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.800]   And as Jesse knows, we will work backwards to fit whatever it takes.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   We will work backwards.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.720]   And sometimes it takes some scrambling, but we work backwards to make things fit.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.640]   I mean, that's why, for example, now that we're going down to one episode, we had to
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.680]   go down to one episode to spend more time thinking about the show because the fixed
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.840]   schedule productivity, secondary fixed schedule productivity I'm running here says half day
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   for the show.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.160]   So if we want to spend more time prepping and record two shows, we would break that
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   boundary.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   So we had to change something else.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   So it forced to change.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.840]   So this is one of my oldest ideas.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.360]   I wrote about this way early in my blog.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   I'm thinking back 2007, 2008, I was writing about this idea.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.620]   This works for a few reasons.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.540]   One is you can consider it a meta productivity strategy because it is a high level commitment
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.060]   that's going to induce a lot of low level specific changes.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.020]   When you have the boundary you have to hit, to hit that boundary, you end up having to
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.820]   do lots of evidence based custom fit tactics that are custom fit to your particular life.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.420]   You quickly sort out the stuff that works that doesn't work.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.380]   It really is a great way of inducing a lot of small changes.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.020]   If instead you try to come up with a lot of ideas from scratch of what you think will
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.780]   help you manage your time or be more productive, you're just throwing darts.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.740]   So fixed schedule productivity is a meta productivity habit and it helps lead to good low level
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.740]   tactics.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.700]   It's also a forcing function to help keep your load sustainable.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.220]   So it'll enforce better productivity ideas in the low level.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.540]   It'll also lead you to say no to more, get a better sense of what your load is.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.460]   When you have these limits, that pushes back and it keeps you or makes it harder for you
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.420]   to overload yourself, which is likely to lead to burnout.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.700]   It also helps you better take advantage of seasonality.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.300]   So you go through a period where maybe things are lighter, you're in between jobs, you're
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.160]   in a quiet season of the job.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.940]   With fixed schedule productivity, if you're used to this, you can take advantage of that
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.180]   situation by collapsing in your fixed schedule.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.620]   Now that you could fit your work in less time and you get used to fitting in less time and
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.940]   you can take advantage of the new time that frees up.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.940]   It's like me in the summer.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.420]   I have less demands because I don't work for Georgetown in the summer.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.500]   I'm on my own dime.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.640]   So I can bring in my working schedule and I do to be much smaller.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.180]   And because I'm used to fixed schedule productivity, I do what I need to fit it in there and I'm
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.460]   able to take advantage of the extra flexibility in summer.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.780]   It is so easy without that to just fill in your time because there's always more things
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.300]   possible for you to do than you have time to accomplish.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.660]   So without these boundaries, it is going to fill up.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.460]   So here are some innovations that have come out of my own commitment to fixed schedule
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.380]   productivity.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.900]   It's where all of my multi-scale planning ideas were formed.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.540]   Semester planning, weekly planning, daily time block planning, all of that was forged
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.740]   in the fires of fixed schedule productivity.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.420]   How do I make my 75 jobs fit in the small time I work?
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.140]   For me, it's roughly 9 to 5, 9 to 5.30 and Sunday mornings is my roughly my main work
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   blocks.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.260]   That's where that came out of is because that's what allowed me to actually fit a reasonable
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.940]   amount of work in there.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.700]   Ruthless quotas and reduction in what's on my plate.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.500]   Fixed schedule productivity pushes that for me and I think it helps keep me away from
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   burnout.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.860]   If I can't make it fit, even with my good productivity systems, I have to quit.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.860]   I can't do this.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.860]   I need to step away from this.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.020]   I need to take a break from that.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.580]   I'm much more likely to have a sustainable load of work because I have this forcing function
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.380]   of it has to fit during these hours.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.460]   It also helped me lead to more efficient processes.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.340]   The type of things I talk about in my book, A World Without Email, come from the demands
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.620]   of I can't just be going back and forth with you all day on email because my time is really
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.620]   precious.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.480]   I have to get a lot in here because I have to stop work at 5.30.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.380]   So we got to figure out a better way to collaborate.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.740]   Again, this back pressure from these boundaries really causes a lot of good.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.740]   All right.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.260]   So I'm a big fan in working backwards from the hours.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.060]   The secondary and tertiary positive effects it has on your life can be quite big.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:08.420]   You know, Jesse, I'll have to say fixed schedule productivity is at the source of the amusement
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.780]   and confusion I often get.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.680]   We talk about this sometimes on the show, but there's a very common critique of me.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.920]   When people hear about the work I do or the type of things I talk about, it's a very common
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.600]   critique where they say, well, you can do that probably because of your wife.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.240]   There must be some sort of unusual support, maybe someone else having to sacrifice in
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.760]   order for you to work on these different things and do this deep work.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   So this comes up a lot.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.960]   Shout out to my friend Scott, who likes to collect these references.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   There's one this week.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.680]   I forgot who it was, but someone on a podcast, he collected a new example of someone saying
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.200]   like, yeah, I'd like this stuff, but I think the real hero is probably his wife.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.640]   The reason why it always baffles me in the moment is because since I've been a working
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.560]   adult, practice fixed schedule productivity, my work hours are just normal standard.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.800]   I'm a government worker, nine to five style work hours.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.540]   I just work the same work hours as like any other normal job.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.160]   So it's not like there's some weird Herculean support I need from other people beyond just
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.400]   the standard thing that everyone who works has to do.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.720]   Like my kids need to be in school and that type of thing.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   So I'm always baffled.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   It's like, well, what do you mean?
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.280]   Like I work actually probably less hours than most people I know.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.320]   And what does the fact that during my normal working hours, I'm very focused, I don't
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.560]   see what that has to do with needing external support.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.200]   But the reason why I think people fall back on that critique is that most people don't
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.260]   do fixed schedule productivity.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.440]   And when you don't do fixed schedule productivity, the assumption is because it's what you're
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.120]   used to.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.840]   More things means more time.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.640]   And if you're doing like a kind of like an impressive thing or an impressive number of
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.580]   things, there must be some impressive time commitment.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.000]   You must be Einstein in the 1920s, you know, disappearing until your office till three
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.440]   in the morning.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.800]   But the thing is with fixed schedule productivity, it does work.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   You can actually get a lot of interesting stuff happening in a very normal, reasonable
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.280]   amount of time that does not require unusual support, does not require unusually long working
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   hours.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.040]   Fixed schedule productivity does really work because that back pressure gets you to focus.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040]   It gets you structured.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   It gets you organized.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   It gets you to essentialize.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   It really is like a tonic, really is like a tonic for productivity.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.360]   Do you remember what the podcast replaced before you did the podcast?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   Like that half day?
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.560]   Was it just writing or?
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.360]   It's a good question because I started it during the early days of the pandemic.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.240]   So you weren't going to Georgetown and stuff.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.640]   I wasn't going to Georgetown.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640]   So I didn't.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   So it's a good point.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.880]   So I didn't have the fixed schedules around the podcast at first because I started it
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.300]   during the summer of 2020.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.120]   So I had a lot of time and we went into the fall, still a lot of time.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.080]   Georgetown was remote.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.800]   And so I wasn't going in.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.520]   And then I was on leave that spring.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   Like my book came out.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.920]   So I had I had a lot of time.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.520]   The half day came in once we got back to the normal schedule, which was like this fall.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.520]   I got to go in.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   I got to teach.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   I'm on committees again.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.360]   And that's like, OK, I have to I have to corral this more.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.760]   So yeah, it's a half day of time.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.000]   There's a lot of things I could easily spend a half day of time on.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.840]   I think it honestly is I went on after my last book launch.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.080]   I'm not as you know, I'm not doing a bunch of interviews right now.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.720]   I'm not I'm thinking about all the time I would be doing podcast interviews or reading
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.920]   interviews, I do a little bit.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.560]   I was on when you were away last week in Canada.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.880]   Their their main morning radio show on CBC, The Current.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   So I did a 30 minute.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   So I do a few things.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.520]   I do a few things.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.680]   That's probably where a lot of the time comes from is I focused in my writing life to the
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   podcast as a half day and then I might my book and article writing.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.320]   So.
