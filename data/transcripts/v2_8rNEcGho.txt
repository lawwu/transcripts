[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.760]   - A very common question we receive is reflected
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.420]   in a question from a podcast listener named Ruth,
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.480]   who asked this, "Pastor John, how should we respond
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.420]   "when LGBT friends want us to refer to them
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420]   "by a different opposite gender name,
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.280]   "like when a female asks everyone
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.920]   "to now call her by a male name?
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.680]   "Should we call them by that male name?"
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.180]   Samantha likewise asks this,
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.960]   "In light of the Bruce Jenner interview
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.300]   "and other celebrities pushing the LGBT agenda,
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.740]   "how should a Christian treat a person
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.060]   "who identifies under one of these labels?
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.000]   "Should I treat a transgender person
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.480]   "as the gender they choose
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660]   "or the one they were born with?
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.640]   "Pastor John, help us with these questions."
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.280]   - Before I give three guidelines that I thought of
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.440]   that would guide behavior in specific response
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.280]   to those questions,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400]   I really do need to lay the foundations here
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.280]   because we're assuming some things
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.960]   that would not be assumed by a lot of people
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.860]   and we need to give an account for why we assume them.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.440]   I'm going to assume,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   I'm gonna try to argue for now, biblically,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   that gender, even though the world considers it
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   distinct from sex, for the Christian,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.480]   should be in sync with the biological genetic sex
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.060]   and there are biblical reasons for that.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.800]   Manhood and womanhood are understood and intended,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.200]   in the Bible that is, intended by God, our creator,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.920]   as biologically or genetically,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.280]   of course the biblical authors
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.560]   didn't know anything about genetics,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440]   but I'm throwing it in because we do
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.360]   and it's in sync with biology, which they did know.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.400]   They're assuming, the biblical writers
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.120]   are intending and assuming that our sex
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.300]   is biologically or genetically identified.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300]   There is vastly more to the meaning of manhood
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.320]   and womanhood than biology and genetics
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.840]   in the way we relate to each other, but not less.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.040]   In other words, manhood and womanhood
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   are glorious, personal realities that transcend genetics
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   and biology, but are never intended to be severed
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.720]   from biology and one of the clearest ways
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.440]   to see this in the Bible is that there are
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   so many references to male child or female child.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.420]   I did this, I looked 'em up just to make sure.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.000]   This is so obvious that people wonder,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.020]   why are you even arguing, but we need to.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.840]   In other words, before children were old enough
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.240]   to express any gender-specific behaviors
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.000]   or desires or preferences, they were identified
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   as male and female and this identity defined their lives.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.240]   For example, sometimes in matters of inheritance
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.780]   and others, other ways.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.480]   There is no thought in the Bible of the possibility
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.360]   that the sex biologically identified
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.200]   could change because of its rooting in biology.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000]   And when Genesis 1:27, therefore, says,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.760]   "God created us male and female,"
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.000]   there is every reason to think that this included
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   our biological genetic nature at the root
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.660]   of all the other transcendent aspects
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.400]   of male and female personhood.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.680]   So we have a pervasive biblical warrant
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   to say that God wills for our sexual identity
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.320]   to be one, to be of one piece
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.640]   with our biological genetic identity.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.880]   Now that's my biblical premise.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.220]   And let me just mention an exception.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.220]   We all know that there are very, very rare situations
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.320]   of heartbreaking biological anomalies
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.040]   where the anatomical sexual organs
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.660]   are ambiguous or compromised.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.120]   In those cases, we face very unusual challenges.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.440]   And if I were a parent and a child was born
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.400]   in that situation, I think I would ask for,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.760]   which you couldn't do generations ago,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.520]   genetic testing and opt for surgery
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.320]   that suits the child best for what his genetics say
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   he or she is, and then raise him or her
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.480]   with that expectation.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.080]   But that is very, very rare.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   And we are talking mainly here
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.440]   about clearly identifiable sexual organs
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.360]   at birth and through life that should define
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800]   the trajectory of the sexual and gender life
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.160]   and understanding.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.000]   Now, how does all that play out in culture
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.500]   where there is an increasingly aggressive effort
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.760]   to force all of us to treat so-called same sex,
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.360]   I mean, so-called sex change surgeries
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.280]   as really changing the sex of a person?
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.680]   Or even short of surgery, we're being asked in Minnesota
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.100]   to treat boys as girls who want to be treated as girls
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.520]   and vice versa so that it determines
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.040]   what team they play on in high school,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.280]   the girls team or the boy team,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.960]   and what locker room they use, what restrooms they use.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.200]   And as Ruth said, who asked this question,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.960]   we're being asked to call Bob, Mary, and Sally, Jim.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.840]   And this will make obedience to Jesus
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.960]   in the coming days increasingly costly for us.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.600]   So now finally, here are my three guidelines.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   Number one, in one sense, the names Sally or Jim
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.340]   are culturally arbitrary.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.940]   And we can name our kids whatever we want.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.660]   We can name them after cars, planets,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.460]   or Greek virtues, or grandma.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.540]   And calling someone by that arbitrary name
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.080]   that their parents may have chosen
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.100]   or they may choose halfway through life
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.740]   may not imply agreement with all that
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.660]   that name was created to signify by the person.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.620]   So if I had a neighbor next door to me,
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.600]   which is very feasible, who was biologically male
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.560]   and everybody knew it,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.300]   and he introduced himself to me as Sally,
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.980]   I met him for the first time, and I saw him the next day,
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.140]   I might avoid calling him anything,
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.180]   but I would probably default to Sally.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.140]   I probably would until there was a relationship
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.300]   that would go deeper to see whether I could be of any help.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.700]   So that's one concession I'm gonna make
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.640]   because of the arbitrary nature of names.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.960]   And then it's gonna get a little more dicey and divisive.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.700]   Number two, however, if in the office where we worked,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.500]   I was compelled to identify
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.900]   every so-called transgendered person by the pronoun
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.220]   they preferred in all of my emails or conversations,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.760]   suppose in emails and conversations,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.700]   I had to use she for a he or he for a she,
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.820]   or I'd get disciplined in the office,
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.260]   at that point, I would say to my superiors,
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.980]   I cannot treat he's as she's and she's as he's.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.300]   I cannot buy the whole package.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.260]   I would be lying.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.100]   I would be lying to call a he a she.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.060]   I'm not lying to call a male Sally.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.460]   That's a culturally arbitrary, weird fluke.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.200]   But I'm lying if I say about a true Jim
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.340]   who wants to be called Sally, she.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.700]   And it would be contrary to my understanding of sexuality,
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.940]   and I would start looking for another job.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.700]   Third, same thing with regard to bathrooms,
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.520]   locker rooms, hotel rooms,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.700]   with women who identify as men or vice versa.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.020]   I would refuse to have a roommate,
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.020]   have a hotel roommate who said she was a man.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.060]   Even though I share a room,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.940]   I travels with my assistant all the time,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.240]   he's a man and I know he's a man,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.600]   and that's a perfectly normal thing to do.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   But if they insisted that I share the same bathroom,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.220]   share the same locker room, share the same hotel room,
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.500]   I'm looking for another job.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.580]   So in summary then, the question is,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.580]   are we forced to call them a name that they prefer,
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.260]   which I'm going to go ahead and probably in the short run,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.640]   at least submit to,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.500]   or are we forced to identify them as a different sex
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.460]   than they really are?
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.620]   Naming may have a certain ambiguity
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.000]   and arbitrariness to it,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.140]   but the language of he and she
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.560]   and the use of bathrooms and hotel rooms does not.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.980]   And I will anyway, draw a line and say,
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.060]   I will not call he, she, I will not call she, he,
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.860]   and I will not intrude on the sexual privacy
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.200]   of a person of the opposite sex
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.860]   or walk into a situation where they would intrude upon mine.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.660]   - That is wise.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.020]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.500]   We live in an age where these questions
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.540]   are going to keep coming at us
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.500]   and then they'll need a thorough biblical response.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.260]   Questions like whether or not
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.340]   we should attend a gay marriage ceremony.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.400]   That was a question we addressed in episode 191
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.820]   and you can find it in the archive.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.980]   Go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.020]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.120]   I'll see you tomorrow.
