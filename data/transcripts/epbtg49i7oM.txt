[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (hip hop music)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:11.560]   - Welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   I am here with my boy, my friend, the GOAT designer,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   up and coming best designer ever, Donnie Nemeus.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.600]   I appreciate you getting on the show, my boy.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   - Thank you for having me, my boy.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.640]   - Let's do it.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640]   So yeah, before we get into the fashion space
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.240]   and everything you got going on,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.160]   I think it's important, you know,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.540]   everybody kind of gets to know you.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.040]   So what was your childhood like growing up?
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.720]   You know, I feel like people with the creative mind
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.480]   that you have always have an interesting childhood
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.520]   and think outside the box.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.280]   So kind of walk me through that.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.720]   - Yeah, growing up, I grew up in a small beach town
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.360]   called Santa Barbara.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.640]   It's about two hours north of Los Angeles.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.960]   Super small community, but I really just grew up
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.360]   skateboarding, spent some time surfing.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.760]   And I was kind of just a--
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.680]   - A free spirit?
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.560]   - Just a free spirit, getting into some trouble as a kid,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.640]   just, you know, getting through school as I could.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.720]   And, you know, I love to play basketball
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.520]   and just kind of hang around and cruise around the city
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.000]   on my skateboard.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.560]   - Was it, so did you go to public school or were you,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.280]   how was that dynamic?
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.920]   - I went to public school.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.280]   I went to Santa Barbara High School,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.800]   Santa Barbara Junior High,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120]   and just kind of breezed my way through.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.120]   I was never really the most academic student, I would say.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.760]   - So at what point then, growing up,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.720]   did you decide like, oh, fashion is important to me.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.640]   I wanna get into this.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.680]   I know you probably didn't have the vision
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   for like a whole brand yet,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.680]   but when did you realize fashion was kind of important to you?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.400]   - Yeah, I really didn't know much about fashion,
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.280]   especially in Santa Barbara.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.240]   There's not much designer stores.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.920]   There's no Saks Fifth Avenue or anything like that.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.120]   We had like a Macy's.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.800]   So I didn't know much about fashion,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.560]   but as I started to spend time at the skate park
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.640]   or at school, I did notice myself looking at
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.200]   what other people were wearing
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.440]   and maybe not as much the brands
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.640]   'cause I didn't know much about that,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.160]   but how they were wearing their clothes,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.640]   how baggy they were,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.840]   were they rolling the cuffs at the bottom?
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.720]   Were they, you know, double layering their t-shirts
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.200]   and how does the collars look?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.640]   So it was more, I started to pay attention
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.360]   to kind of like the silhouettes of what people were wearing
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.320]   and noticed what I liked and didn't like.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.360]   And I think that was my first kind of like
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   instinctive, like loving fashion or how things were worn.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.320]   - Right.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.440]   And like, obviously, you know,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.080]   you have this big brand now that's booming.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   You know, things are going well for you.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.120]   - It's getting there.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.480]   - It didn't always start out like that.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   You don't just become the entrepreneur you are.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.600]   You had to start somewhere.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.800]   So like walk me through like, okay, you know,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.240]   high school, college,
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.920]   and then did you have to do some interning
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.200]   or what did that kind of,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.800]   how did that journey look for you?
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.680]   - I was definitely just a self-taught designer.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.080]   I had no clue what I was doing.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.760]   I knew I wanted to do it.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.680]   So I initially started by just kind of,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.840]   my first garments was I was sewing pockets on t-shirts.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.000]   I was going to craft stores,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   picking some interesting fabrics I liked
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.000]   and sewing pockets on shirts.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.640]   I was screen printing
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.920]   and I was just trying to sell these to friends and family.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.840]   And just at the time I thought it was cool,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.760]   but looking back,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.600]   it's almost embarrassing what some of the stuff looked like,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.120]   but you got to start somewhere.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.560]   But every piece I did,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.720]   I started to learn what made it better and better.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.440]   And it just took years of evolving to understand
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.040]   like how to get to a luxury brand level
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   versus a very amateur kid starting a brand.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   - Yeah, anyone who starts their own business,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.240]   like I have a lot of respect for,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.480]   'cause it's just so many hoops you have to jump through.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   What was something that was like harder than you thought
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.200]   about inventing your own thing like from scratch?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.480]   Is it the hiring of people?
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.200]   'Cause I mean, I've been to your warehouse plenty of times.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.080]   It's a lot going on.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.040]   What was some of those kind of early on struggles
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.480]   and things of like literally starting from the ground up?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.720]   - I think the hardest thing
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.520]   is really finding your voice as a designer.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.680]   I think starting out,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.840]   all I was doing at the beginning
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.280]   was looking at all the other designers,
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.480]   like who's winning, who's working and what are they doing?
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.200]   And I'd be like trying to rework
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.960]   what was already out on the market.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.600]   And I think once my brand started to grow
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.640]   was when I stopped looking at what other people were doing
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.400]   and taking inspiration from them,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.120]   but diving into myself for inspiration
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.640]   and making unique original pieces that were true to me.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.360]   So I think things started to work
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.160]   as you learn to be more authentic
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.600]   and find your own brand DNA
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.000]   versus being influenced by others.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.560]   I think everyone starts that way.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560]   Everyone starts by loving something
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   and taking it from there,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.960]   but then you'll learn to create your own as you go.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.600]   - And man, there's so many brands now,
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.520]   so many people trying to dip their feet
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.360]   in the fashion world
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.520]   that it's probably hard to even come up with creative ideas.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.600]   I mean, but me and you have talked about,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.840]   and it's similar in basketball,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.920]   like when you feel refreshed
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.480]   or you feel like mentally, physically, emotionally,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.560]   like stress-free, you come up with your best ideas.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.080]   And like I said, I've been to your warehouse
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.640]   and there's so many unique pieces.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.240]   Like how do you even come up with these concepts?
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.080]   Is it just sitting there
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.440]   and kind of like sitting still and meditating
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.480]   and just thinking of things,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.080]   or is it just like they come to you on the fly?
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.440]   How is that process?
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.560]   - Yeah, it'll come in waves.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.800]   Like there'll be days or weeks even where I'm just slumped.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.960]   I can't think of anything.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.520]   Like I'll just be so consumed by the business as a whole
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.800]   and the operations and having to answer to so many people.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.760]   But then there's days that I'll go up to Santa Barbara
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.080]   for the weekend, let my mind and like my brain
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.760]   kind of turn off and like my brain will just start firing.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.440]   And I'll just take a bunch of notes on my phone
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.800]   or sketch something out real quick.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.680]   And like I could get a whole collection done
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.120]   in a matter of a few days,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.040]   but sometimes it could take a few weeks just to be like,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.720]   figure out what the fuck am I doing with these genes.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.280]   So I think mental clarity is key.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.200]   And this industry is like so stressful.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.580]   So it's really important to figure out times
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.800]   that you can be alone and just let your mind rest.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.760]   'Cause that's when you'll perform the best.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.560]   I'm sure same with basketball.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   - It's that inner work and that inner peace
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.920]   that then allows you to go do the physical thing
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   at a high level.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.120]   It's super true.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.000]   You talk about the stress of this industry.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I mean, everyone kind of looks at their own
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.400]   kind of like the area they're in in life.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.000]   Athletes think that we have it the worst
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.500]   and it's so stressful and we have so much pressure.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.480]   Other people working a nine to five
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.200]   think they got it rough.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.240]   And then you talk about the stresses
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.520]   and I guess the anxieties of like your industry,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.320]   kind of what makes the fashion industry
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.800]   so competitive and so hard?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.320]   I mean, there's only so many dope designer brands
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.800]   that people like to wear.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   Is that the hardest thing
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.360]   or what do you think makes it so stressful?
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.960]   - I think it's so competitive
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.320]   in the sense, I mean, even comparing it to basketball,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.760]   like there's so many hoopers out there
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.000]   and there's so many incredible basketball players,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.640]   but only like few can shine through that.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.520]   And that might be through work ethic or not giving up
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.320]   or a certain style or a certain swagger
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   that make people connect to it more.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.360]   And I think same with fashion.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.660]   There is so many brands.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.680]   I think almost every kid grows up,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.160]   like I wanna have a brand.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.880]   Like it's such a common thing.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.800]   So I think just being able to figure out
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.640]   how to shine through the rest
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.400]   and it's really about being different
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.560]   and pushing boundaries.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.080]   And like, you can't be afraid.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.480]   Just like in basketball,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.280]   you can't be afraid to take that last shot.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.800]   If you miss, you miss.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.520]   Like people might hate on you at that moment,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.960]   but if you make it, you're great.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.340]   And so I think same with putting out collections.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.380]   You can't be timid.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.720]   You gotta just really put something out that feels good
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.320]   and it might be a little scary to put out
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.720]   'cause maybe people respond poorly to it,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.060]   but maybe they absolutely love you for it.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.160]   So just put it, you know.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.520]   - That's a really good point
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.460]   because like I was watching some interview
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.300]   and it really connected with me.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.320]   And it was like the best players, basketball players,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.820]   and I'm sure, you know, it's weird.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.120]   Like in the NBA, every player at some point
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.560]   was the man on their team.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.320]   So they had this trait at some point.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.340]   They probably were taking the last shot at some point,
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.620]   but the trait of being able to take on the risk
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.020]   and being confident enough to fail
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.820]   is really what makes the superstars in the NBA.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.420]   It makes the great players in the NBA.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.340]   And I'm sure it's similar like in your space,
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.780]   like being confident enough in your ability
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.100]   that you're okay failing and you're okay with the backlash.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.160]   I feel like a lot of complacent people in life,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.100]   that's one of the things they lack is--
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.940]   - For sure.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.200]   - And that makes them fly under the radar.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.580]   But being able to take on that risk is an important trait.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.540]   - Yeah, the amount of failures I've had is like,
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.620]   there's been thousands.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.240]   So I've taken every failure as a way to learn,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.060]   but yeah, it's damn near impossible
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.300]   to succeed in this business.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.980]   So just being able to eat shit day in and day out
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.780]   and just keep pushing and keep trying.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.820]   And if you give up, that's when you won't make it.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.220]   But if you keep pushing, like there is a finish line
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.860]   or not necessarily a finish line,
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.680]   but you're gonna get somewhere as long as you keep pushing
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.120]   and you gotta be able to handle the failures
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   and the people that are against you.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.920]   And people will come in waves of loving you or hating you
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.260]   or loving the product or hating the product.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.100]   - Yeah.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.040]   - So.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.000]   - That does seem stressful.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.220]   What is your ways you think of being able to deal with that?
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.840]   I mean, basketball athletes have their own ways.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.740]   I'm sure you have your way.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.160]   How do you, 'cause it's a lot.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.000]   And to even maintain like joy and happiness in life,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.060]   you gotta have, is it your family, your friend?
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.900]   What is it?
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.060]   - That's what I'm, this year,
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.420]   like just this past few months is like,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.420]   I'm really learning to be present and enjoy life for,
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.580]   yeah, family, find the friends that you love
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.600]   and figure out the things that give you peace
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.020]   and do those things.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.480]   Because I got caught, got so caught up
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.300]   just being stressed about wanting to perform
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.460]   and make sure I'd be so successful
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.380]   and I'd get this pop-up and my clothes would be
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.220]   in this store.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.960]   But in the end, you get those things
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.420]   and like nothing really changed about your life
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.060]   or your heart or your wellbeing.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.060]   So the things that really mattered
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.420]   would be spending that time with your family
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.580]   and friends and loved ones.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.300]   And that's what really matters.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.380]   And then making sure your business,
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.580]   your business will perform better
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.020]   if you put more attention into those things,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.340]   you know, 'cause you'll be more at peace.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.900]   And it's just kind of having that carefree feeling.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.380]   Like if it works, it works.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.500]   If it doesn't, it doesn't.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.060]   But I love what I'm doing.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.100]   And like, that's how your mentality should be.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.180]   - It is true.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.020]   And it's weird.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.820]   Like when people talk about even the law of attraction
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.460]   and things like this, the more you want something,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.820]   sometimes the more it evades you.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.300]   But the more you kind of like, you know,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.120]   put your energy into other things as well
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.620]   and kind of just, you know, like you said,
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.700]   that carefree mentality.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.460]   And this is something I think I've spoken
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.820]   on another podcast, but how when you're so focused
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.220]   on chasing something or like an end goal,
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.580]   sometimes we get those things
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.380]   and it doesn't change anything about how happy we are,
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.460]   how peaceful we are.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.260]   And it's weird how some people go through their whole life
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.300]   and they think if I get this or I get this or this,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   that will make me happy.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.980]   You know, as a basketball player,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.460]   I've talked about this before, you know,
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.540]   your whole life, you wanna be a D1 player,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.900]   whatever it is, you get that.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.460]   Then you're like, man, I really wanna get drafted.
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.780]   If I get drafted and I get some money
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.780]   and I can help my family out, then I'll be happy.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.060]   Then you get in the NBA and you're not playing.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.060]   Then you're like, oh, if I could just get on the court
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.340]   and be in the rotation, I'll be happy.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.180]   Then it's, I wanna be a star, I wanna be.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.180]   And so the whole point is like, it never stops.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.140]   - It never stops.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.220]   - That's the human kind of mind.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.620]   I don't know, like, I feel like in a,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.500]   over here in the Western world,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.060]   that's probably just more of like the hustler mindset,
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.160]   the American dream, like go get it mindset,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.180]   but it really kills a lot of people's ability
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.140]   to achieve peace and happiness.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.980]   So I think--
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.300]   - It's so hard to be happy, yeah.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.140]   - I think, you know, in an industry as stressful as yours,
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.540]   and we've talked about this in the sauna at Voda,
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.780]   shout out to Voda Spa.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.620]   - Voda.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.180]   - We go there and we have good conversations.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.140]   - Voda.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.140]   - Yeah, we've just talked about like,
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.180]   how do you have happiness and peace
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.660]   through the midst of like the entire
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   stressful process of life?
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.580]   And you kind of have come to that realization,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.060]   which I feel like is important.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.620]   - So now I'm just learning how to tackle that
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.980]   the best of my ability, like going back on that.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.940]   For instance, we just opened up our own pop-up takeover
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.460]   at Maxfield in Los Angeles,
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.100]   one of the best boutiques in the world.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.940]   Like since I started, that was my dream.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.100]   It's like, I want my name on the window of Maxfield.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.220]   I wanna do an installation.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.740]   I wanna have a collection with them.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.780]   We just had that.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.620]   The opening night was just the other night
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.620]   and it was amazing, but it happened and now it's gone.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.040]   I mean, it's still up, but it just like,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.700]   that moment happened and it's just like, now what?
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.420]   Like now what?
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.020]   And so like, but then I had a night with my family
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.420]   and friends and we celebrated and being at home with them
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.940]   was almost the better moment than the event itself.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   You know, like, so just finding ways to step back
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.260]   and breathe and just, I think being present
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.340]   is the hardest part 'cause we're always consumed
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.420]   like on what's next or how am I gonna make this better?
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.500]   Are people gonna like it?
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.540]   And it's really just about like when I spend time with you,
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.560]   it's like, it's just different, you know?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.740]   - Bro, same thing.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.580]   Like I would compare your Maxfield opening
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.460]   to like us winning the finals, right?
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.500]   Every NBA player's goal is to win a championship, you know?
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.660]   And then you do that and then you celebrate the next day
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.380]   and the next two days, bro, you're just at home.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.820]   Like what's next?
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.900]   Like what?
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.820]   And then, you know, you get to celebrate with your family
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.060]   and you know, you have the memories,
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.660]   but even when like I saw like the Chiefs, for example,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.380]   like Patrick Mahomes and then win the Super Bowl
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.180]   this past year and he was in the press conference,
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.820]   he was like, "We're gonna get a third one next year."
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.700]   But you just won that one and it's hard
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.780]   to even like enjoy the moment.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.100]   So it's a whole, it's just a,
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.280]   it's a crazy mindset that we have as humans.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.700]   But going back to, like you said,
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.660]   you just opened up your pop-up shop at Maxfield
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.980]   and that's a big deal.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.020]   - It's the Mecca.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.100]   It's like every designer's dream
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.500]   is to do a takeover with Maxfield.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.380]   - Yeah, that's huge.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.420]   How did that kind of like come about
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.980]   and how do you see that kind of springboarding your brand
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.700]   even to bigger heights than it is?
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.220]   - I mean, that came, that's just a million baby steps
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.220]   getting to this point.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.180]   Like I posted on my social media
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.460]   along with the photo of me at Maxfield
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.460]   with a swipe to the email showing in 2016, 2017, 2018,
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.660]   asking the buyers just for a chance,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.580]   just to show them the collection.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.100]   Like I was just banging my foot on the door.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.980]   And so it was just years of perseverance
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.680]   and not giving up and the time will come.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.100]   So I think it was just that matter
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.020]   of just not giving up on that.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.300]   - Yeah, I can't wait to go check it out.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.300]   We're gonna go check it out tomorrow morning.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.300]   You got the big apple in there in the store.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.140]   Talk about that.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.340]   What is the meaning of that?
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.820]   - Yeah, I partnered with this amazing digital artist,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.860]   Andres Reisinger, and we were conceptualizing
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.460]   how to make something super special.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.100]   But for me, the apple is a representation
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.020]   of knowledge and happiness.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.860]   Like that's one of the two main things of the apple.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.820]   So having this moment in my career
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.680]   was like showing these past years of work.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.140]   It represents that knowledge has got me here.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.860]   And then just the happiness of being able to be here
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.420]   and have that moment.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.380]   So I thought it'd be so impactful
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.820]   to just take that huge apple and just plant it in the store,
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.660]   plant it in the window.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.980]   'Cause that's like, I would drive by this block
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.460]   and manifest it for years.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.820]   So then like now I can just see it
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.660]   and it's just in your face.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.820]   - You know, that's dope.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.740]   Yeah, I was wondering what that meant.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.700]   A couple other concepts that you've come up with
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.300]   is the Summerland.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.840]   You know, you got that on the hats, on the shirts.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.680]   Talk about that.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.900]   What is the meaning of Summerland?
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.580]   - Summerland, it's a small town within Santa Barbara.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.380]   I spent years growing up there.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.420]   And it's just like a small beach town,
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.260]   which I feel like is like, it defines California.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.460]   It's like a little beach ocean
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.620]   and then right behind you is the mountains.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.500]   And it's just so laid back and cool.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.820]   And I pull all my inspiration from it.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.460]   It's almost like this dreamland.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.580]   And I think a lot of people don't even know
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.060]   Summerland is a real town.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.900]   - Yeah, I gotta go check it out.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.440]   - So it's a real place and it's so small,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.980]   but it's like, it almost represents anything to anyone.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.940]   It's like, what is your dreamland?
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.300]   What's your dream state?
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.760]   Where do you want to be that makes you most at peace?
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.020]   And for me, it's going home.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.840]   - That's dope.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.740]   And then the other one is, you know,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.140]   you got it on your hat, the Miracle, the Miracle Academy.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.180]   You know, you have a miracle in a lot of your stuff.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.860]   What does that mean to you?
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.540]   - The Miracle to me is, I mean,
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.300]   I find it to be one of the most impactful words
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.500]   in the dictionary, it's just like,
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.100]   but the fact that I'm here today and doing what I'm doing,
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.740]   I had a phase as a kid in my upbringing.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.940]   I was a really troubled youth teenager.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.780]   I got into a ton of trouble.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.460]   I was sent to Utah for wilderness programs.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.060]   I went to juvenile hall.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.780]   Like I was like really a rough kid
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.860]   and I was really lost and confused
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.460]   and getting into a lot of things I shouldn't be doing.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.380]   So just the idea of being able to turn around from that
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.380]   and basically transform into the person I am today,
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.780]   I see as a miracle.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.720]   And that's just like my little story of it,
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.540]   but it works for the business and the brand as well.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.860]   'Cause I think so many people relate to it in so many ways.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.300]   I think everyone has their own kind of miracle
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.940]   that they can relate to in their lifetime.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.740]   So it just is, yeah.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.220]   - Do you feel like, how much do you connect that miracle to,
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.620]   do you connect it to coincidence?
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.920]   Do you connect it to God?
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.340]   I mean, obviously me and you,
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.540]   we kick it with Jude all the time.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.540]   I know faith has become more important to you
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.820]   and you're still trying to figure it out,
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.080]   going to church and things like that,
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.780]   but kind of what is your thoughts in that space?
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.780]   - I connect it to a little of everything.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.700]   I think I connect it to faith.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.700]   I connect it to coincidence.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.820]   I connect it to work ethic.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.380]   I connect it to kindness.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.220]   I think really the way you treat people
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.060]   is almost one of the biggest parts.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.820]   If you're loving to people and you're always outgoing,
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.860]   making sure someone else is okay,
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.420]   I feel like that's the best way
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.020]   that this world can be a better place.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.620]   And so I think there'll be more miracles
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.100]   the more we can be better humans to everyone else.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.880]   'Cause I think it's getting pretty rough out there.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.460]   And I think a lot of people are getting more
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.940]   and more closed off and more out there for themselves.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.860]   And I think if we can change
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.940]   to where more people are worried about others,
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.320]   like still protect yourself,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.060]   but there's so many people just going through it.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.540]   So just checking in on them,
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.900]   it can change a lot for everybody.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.220]   - Well, you're amazing at that.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.300]   I mean, we've talked about this in the car.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.380]   I remember me, you and Judah were sitting there
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.020]   and we were like, what do you think is,
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.180]   we were going around asking what each one thought
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.860]   each other's strengths were.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.900]   And the word that kept coming up about you
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.780]   is just how caring you are for your friends
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.580]   and your people, and that's an obvious trait about you.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.220]   All this stuff is going on in your business and stuff,
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.100]   but you still find time to make sure
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.060]   everybody else is straight. - That's right.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.980]   - And I feel, bro, that's gonna come back around.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.540]   That's why you have so many relationships that you do.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.860]   Talk about that, the relationships
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.220]   with some of these celebrities.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.120]   You're close with Kodak, you're close with Chris Brown,
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.460]   some of the NBA players, Justin.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.860]   How do you feel like some of those relationships
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.780]   really came about?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.180]   Because I feel like a lot of people in this space
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.260]   are very closed off, but you come around
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.060]   and they are very open with you.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.340]   Why do you think that is?
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.380]   And how did those relationships kind of come about?
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.820]   - Man, I think I'm definitely just blessed
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.500]   in the sense of, I don't know, I think I definitely
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.860]   have a special trait of connecting with someone
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.580]   and just kind of feeling what's inside of them.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.680]   And I think they can almost see it or feel it.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.860]   I don't know what it is.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.180]   It might be a superpower I was given.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.220]   But for instance, my relationship with Kodak,
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   he's a very closed off guy.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.060]   He's got a very tight circle.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.340]   But since we met, we became like bonded brothers
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.300]   and he loved me and we would have great conversation.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.380]   Even his management is just like, I don't know what it is,
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.100]   but Bill loves you, you know?
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.340]   So I don't know, I think they just understand
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.700]   that I'm trying to care for them for them.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.800]   And it's like, you're an amazing rapper.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.220]   I love you for your music and your craft,
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.140]   but I also think you're great
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.840]   and I can tell you have a good heart.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.260]   So I think we connect on that level.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.340]   And that same with even Chris Brown
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.940]   and all these other guys and all these ball players.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.100]   I think I relate to a lot of these basketball guys.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.420]   I grew up playing basketball.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.220]   I'm not 6'10" like you, but I get buckets.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.460]   And I think I just relate.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.500]   I feel like I just connect and relate with these people
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.180]   on a natural and organic level.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.620]   And I think they just feel it.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.300]   And so it just works in my favor
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.860]   and hopefully theirs too, you know?
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.620]   It's just becomes real friendships.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.300]   - Yeah, nah, it's a gift you have for sure.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.000]   And I think in the industry you're in,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.100]   relationships is very important, you know?
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.420]   I mean, you're in the early stages
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.420]   of kind of what this is going to become.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.940]   And you're in the grinding stages.
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.500]   You may not be making like tons, millions of dollars.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.700]   But the relationships you have, the stuff that you make,
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.940]   it's only a matter of time.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.900]   So as stressful as it is, bro,
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.020]   it's inevitable that this is going to be the next thing.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.380]   You know, Joker talks about your stuff all the time.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.940]   You got Justin over here wearing it.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.140]   You know, Chris Brown, like you got the connections.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.940]   It's just keep it going, bro.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.120]   Your stuff is dope.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.980]   This is a question I want to ask you
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.140]   'cause you're in the fashion industry.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.260]   Why do you think that the fashion is going sometimes
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.340]   towards this, for men's wear,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.580]   towards kind of the, sometimes the feminine type of stuff?
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.820]   Like, and do you see yourself ever going in that direction
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.380]   with someone like the skirts
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.180]   or the stuff the dude's wearing fashion-wise?
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.020]   Do you see that?
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.840]   Why do you think that is?
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.900]   And do you see yourself ever going out?
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.820]   - I see that, but I would never go there.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.340]   I'm always going to stay authentic.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.060]   But I see, I think the skirts and all this stuff,
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.060]   I think that's just designers finding ways
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.980]   to push their boundaries.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.580]   How do we make something?
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.980]   How do we make some noise?
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.100]   How do we be different?
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.620]   And every designer has their way of doing it.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.260]   For me, I'm not going to put a man in a skirt.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.220]   - Yeah, or even like the fingernail polish.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.980]   What do you think about all that stuff?
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.740]   - It's just, it's their taste.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.500]   I think every human has their own flavor
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.060]   of like expressing themselves.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.900]   And I have nothing against any of it.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.820]   And some people can pull it off.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.560]   Like I could, I've seen, I think like Westbrook in a skirt
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.860]   and he kind of looks dope.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.260]   But it's not for me.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.260]   - Jordan Clarks and rocks sometimes.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.060]   - My brand's not going to go there, I don't think.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.620]   But who knows, maybe in two, three years,
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.620]   I have some weird face and I got men in dresses.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.660]   You never know, but.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.620]   - No, I feel you.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.700]   I just always wanted to ask that
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.300]   'cause it's so funny to me how.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.380]   - I find it funny.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.380]   I think the fashion game,
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.100]   I think there's so much real stuff in it,
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.620]   but I think there's so much comical artificial stuff
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.660]   in the fashion game too.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   I think there's designers that are true and authentic,
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.420]   and I think there's designers that are just,
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.020]   I don't know, just a bit comical
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.700]   and just a bit artificial.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.420]   - Why do you think, like fashion goes through phases.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.340]   It used to be the baggy, the baggy stuff,
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.340]   and then it went to guys wanting to skate.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.140]   - I know the theory.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.980]   For instance, you got a skate,
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.020]   I think true, real, cool culture.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.060]   I'm talking, I guess, on a California level first.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.860]   You got skaters wearing baggy jeans
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.820]   and these puffy skate shoes.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.900]   Designers now are doing these puffy skate shoes,
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.900]   baggy jeans, and now that everyone's wearing baggy,
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.980]   now these skate cats are real street kids
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.340]   that now they go back to skinny.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.740]   So I think it's almost like a chase
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.820]   of the cool kids trying to identify on their own level.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.020]   They're gonna dress their way.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.020]   That becomes commercialized,
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.700]   and then it almost just goes backwards.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.620]   It's gonna be a vicious cycle forever.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.780]   And I think it's just a matter of,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.980]   there's that core cool community that paves the lane,
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.500]   and then there's the designer houses
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.020]   and bigger conglomerates or whatever
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.620]   looking at what cool kids are doing,
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.660]   and then they're gonna recreate it.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.780]   Maybe not as well, but it's kind of just--
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.940]   - Do you see yourself going back to the,
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.260]   'cause it is crazy how it used to be baggy,
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.620]   and then that got weird kind of,
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.700]   and everyone was wearing the skinny stuff,
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.860]   even the joggers, you cuffed it in your shoes.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.540]   Now everybody wants the big sweats
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.380]   to go over their shoes.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.700]   Do you, when do you see it going back skinny,
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.780]   and do you see yourself following?
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.020]   I mean, I guess as a designer,
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.540]   you kind of gotta go with the culture,
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.460]   but when do you see that kind of happening?
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.100]   'Cause it's just, I feel like, it's so weird,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.420]   'cause I used to think skinny was so dope,
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.860]   and now I can't stand it.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.700]   - Can't stand it.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.540]   - And then we're baggy.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.660]   - People be looking goofy.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.540]   They look like Dr. Groom from the '80s.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.940]   - Right, when do you see it going back that way?
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.780]   - I mean, skinny's coming back.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.180]   I think there's always gonna be,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.260]   there's certain designers that'll stick to their core.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.180]   You got Hedy Slimane,
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.900]   like he's gonna have skinny jeans forever,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.060]   and there's other designers that will have skinny,
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.860]   but as a brand and a business in the end,
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.700]   they're gonna have to cater to an audience
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.740]   and sell what they can.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.740]   So I see skinny coming back in a sense.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.580]   I don't know if I'm gonna play with it,
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.100]   but I've always worn baggy clothes.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.020]   Even in high school, there was this phase of crew jeans,
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.700]   these crew skinny jeans.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.260]   I just made fun of my friends forever for it,
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.420]   and I just never got there,
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.780]   but everyone has their taste.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.620]   - Yeah, the baggy's definitely doper.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.060]   All right, man, my last question for you.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.020]   What is your overall vision for NMEA's
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.700]   and kinda your purpose for the brand overall,
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.300]   for you overall?
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.260]   What is your purpose,
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.700]   and then what is the vision for the entire brand?
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.700]   - My vision for the brand is to make it as big as possible,
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.660]   but still holding its authentic feel and love,
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.780]   and in the end, it is a business.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.980]   I want it to make money.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.140]   I want the world to know about it.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.660]   I want people to wear it and feel comfortable
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.660]   and confident wearing it.
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.740]   So as big as NMEA's can go,
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.660]   where it'll still feel authentic, I want it there,
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.020]   and me as a human and as a person with a purpose,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.620]   it's definitely going beyond clothing.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.700]   I wanna explore everything from fashion
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.100]   to charity to organization to furniture,
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.500]   different forms of art.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.780]   This is just the start for me,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.860]   and this is my home base to build myself as a person
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.820]   and then see what else I could do.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.300]   I got plenty of time.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.020]   I just turned 31,
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.340]   but I see something greater
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.540]   with this whole Miracle and Miracle Academy.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.700]   I see it as almost like a charity program or a situation.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.180]   We also have Miracle Garden,
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.620]   and it's like, so there's so many things I wanna play with
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.540]   and explore in the future beyond clothing.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.580]   - Yeah, and I mean, I just gotta point out
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.420]   something you just said that just hit me
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.780]   was the fact that you use this fashion brand
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.740]   and what you're doing to shape you as a human
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.340]   for some of the other things that you wanna do in life.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.220]   And for me or anyone, I think that's important,
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.060]   not letting what you do become your sole identity
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.140]   to where it's all-consuming.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.700]   Me, I should be using basketball to help me grow mentally,
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.460]   to help me fulfill my purpose in other areas,
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.220]   inspiring people, giving back to the people
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.140]   through charity and things.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.100]   So I think that's important 'cause a lot of people,
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.380]   what they do is who they are.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.980]   And you just said you use, Nimesh, you use this fashion
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.580]   to explore who you are, grow who you are
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.340]   so you can ultimately reach your purpose.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.740]   So man, I admire you, bro.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.580]   - I love you, bro.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.420]   - I appreciate you getting on the podcast, dog.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.260]   - I love you, bro.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.100]   - My man.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.140]   - I already gave up my dreams of being in the NBA,
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.500]   so at least I can make some clothes for the NBA players
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.460]   and everybody else.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.460]   - Appreciate you, dog.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.820]   Curious Mike out.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.940]   - I drink one of these smoothies every day.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.720]   Banana, blueberry.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.420]   It's tough, tough life out here.
