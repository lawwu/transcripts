[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.560]   - Welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   I am here with my boy, my friend, the GOAT designer,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   up and coming best designer ever, Donnie Nemeus.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.600]   I appreciate you getting on the show, my boy.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   - Thank you for having me, my boy.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.640]   - Let's do it.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640]   So yeah, before we get into the fashion space
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.240]   and everything you got going on,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.160]   I think it's important, you know,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.520]   everybody kind of gets to know you.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.000]   So what was your childhood like growing up?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.680]   You know, I feel like people with the creative mind
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.440]   that you have, always have an interesting childhood
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.480]   to think outside the box.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.280]   So kind of walk me through that.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.680]   - Yeah, growing up, I grew up in a small beach town
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   called Santa Barbara.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.600]   It's about two hours north of Los Angeles.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   Super small community, but I really just grew up
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.320]   skateboarding, spent some time surfing,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.720]   and I was kind of just a--
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.640]   - A free spirit?
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.520]   - Just a free spirit, getting into some trouble as a kid,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.600]   just, you know, getting through school as I could.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.680]   And, you know, I loved to play basketball
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.480]   and just kind of hang around and cruise around the city
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.920]   on my skateboard.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   - Was it, so did you go to public school
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.240]   or were you, how was that dynamic?
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.880]   - I went to public school.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.240]   I went to Santa Barbara High School,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.760]   Santa Barbara Junior High,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.040]   and just kind of breezed my way through.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   I was never really the most academic student, I would say.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.680]   - So at what point then, growing up,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.640]   did you decide like, oh, fashion is important to me.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.560]   I wanna get into this.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.600]   I know you probably didn't have the vision
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.200]   for like a whole brand yet,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560]   but when did you realize fashion was kind of important to you?
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.320]   - Yeah, I really didn't know much about fashion,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200]   especially in Santa Barbara.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.160]   There's not much designer stores.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.880]   There's no Saks Fifth Avenue or anything like that.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   We had like a Macy's.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.760]   So I didn't know much about fashion,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.520]   but as I started to spend time at the skate park
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.600]   or at school, I did notice myself looking at
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.160]   what other people were wearing
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.400]   and maybe not as much the brands,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.600]   'cause I didn't know much about that,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.120]   but how they were wearing their clothes,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.600]   how baggy they were,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.800]   were they rolling the cuffs at the bottom,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.640]   were they double layering their t-shirts,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.120]   and how does the collars look.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.560]   So it was more, I started to pay attention
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.280]   to kind of like the silhouettes of what people were wearing
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.240]   and noticed what I liked and didn't like.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.000]   And I think that was my first kind of like instinctive,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.400]   like loving fashion or how things were worn.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.360]   - Right, and like, obviously, you know,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.000]   you have this big brand now that's booming.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.840]   You know, things are going well.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.040]   - It's getting there.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.400]   - It didn't always start out like that.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   You don't just become the entrepreneur you are.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.560]   You had to start somewhere.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.720]   So like walk me through like, okay, you know,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.160]   high school, college,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   and then did you have to do some interning
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.160]   or what did that kind of,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.720]   how did that journey look for you?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.600]   - I was definitely just a self-taught designer.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.000]   I had no clue what I was doing.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.680]   I knew I wanted to do it.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.600]   So I initially started by just kind of,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.760]   my first garments was I was selling pockets on t-shirts.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.920]   I was going to craft stores,
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.520]   picking some interesting fabrics I liked
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.960]   and selling pockets on shirts.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.600]   I was screen printing
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.880]   and I was just trying to sell these to friends and family.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.800]   And just at the time I thought it was cool,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.720]   but looking back,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.560]   it's almost embarrassing what some of the stuff looked like,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   but you got to start somewhere.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.520]   But every piece I did,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.680]   I started to learn what made it better and better.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.400]   And it just took years of evolving to understand
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.000]   like how to get to a luxury brand level
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   versus a very amateur kid starting a brand.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   - Yeah, anyone who starts their own business,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.200]   like I have a lot of respect for,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.440]   'cause it's just so many hoops you have to jump through.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   What was something that was like harder than you thought
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.160]   about inventing your own thing, like from scratch?
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.440]   Is it the hiring of people?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.160]   'Cause I mean, I've been to your warehouse plenty of times.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.040]   It's a lot going on.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.000]   What was some of those kind of early on struggles
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.440]   and things of like literally starting from the ground up?
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.680]   - I think the hardest thing
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.480]   is really finding your voice as a designer.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.640]   I think starting out,
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.800]   all I was doing at the beginning
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.240]   was looking at all the other designers,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.440]   like who's winning, who's working and what are they doing?
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.160]   And I'd be like trying to rework
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.920]   what was already out on the market.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.560]   And I think once my brand started to grow
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.600]   was when I stopped looking at what other people were doing
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.360]   and taking inspiration from them,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080]   but diving into myself for inspiration
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.600]   and like making unique original pieces that were true to me.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.320]   So I think things started to work
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.120]   as you learn to be more authentic
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.560]   and find your own brand DNA
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.000]   versus being influenced by others.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.520]   I think everyone starts that way.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   Everyone starts by loving something
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   and taking it from there,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.920]   but then you'll learn to create your own as you go.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.560]   - And man, there's so many brands now,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.480]   so many people trying to dip their feet
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.320]   in the fashion world
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.480]   that it's probably hard to even come up with creative ideas.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.560]   I mean, but me and you have talked about,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.800]   and it's similar in basketball,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.880]   like when you feel refreshed
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.440]   or you feel like mentally, physically, emotionally,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   like stress-free, you come up with your best ideas.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.040]   And like I said, I've been to your warehouse
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.600]   and there's so many unique pieces.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.200]   Like how do you even come up with these concepts?
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.040]   Is it just sitting there
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.400]   and kind of like sitting still and meditating
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.440]   and just thinking of things,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.040]   or is it just like they come to you on the fly?
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   How is that process?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.520]   - Yeah, it'll come in waves.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.760]   Like there'll be days or weeks even where I'm just slumped.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.920]   I can't think of anything.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.480]   Like I'll just be so consumed by the business as a whole
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.760]   and the operations and having to answer to so many people.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.680]   But then there's days that
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.440]   I'll go up to Santa Barbara for the weekend,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.040]   let my mind and like my brain kind of turn off,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.720]   and like my brain will just start firing.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.400]   And I'll just take a bunch of notes on my phone
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.760]   or sketch something out real quick.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.640]   And like I could get a whole collection done
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.080]   in a matter of a few days,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.000]   but sometimes it could take a few weeks
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.600]   just to be like, figure out
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.680]   what the fuck am I doing with these genes, you know?
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.240]   So I think mental clarity is key.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.160]   And this industry is like so stressful.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.540]   So it's really important to figure out times
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.760]   that you can, you know, be alone
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   and just let your mind rest,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.720]   'cause that's when you'll perform the best.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.520]   I'm sure same with basketball, like.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.560]   - It's that inner work and that inner peace
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.880]   that then allows you to go do the physical thing
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.040]   at a high level.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.080]   It's super true.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.960]   You talk about the stress of this industry.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.960]   I mean, everyone kind of looks at their own
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.160]   kind of like the area they're in in life.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.960]   You know, athletes think that we have it the worst
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.160]   and it's so stressful and we have so much pressure.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.440]   You know, other people working a nine to five
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   think they got it rough, you know?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.200]   And then you talk about the stresses
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.480]   and I guess the anxieties of like your industry.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.280]   Kind of what makes the fashion industry
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.760]   so competitive and so hard?
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.280]   I mean, there's only so many dope designer brands
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.760]   that people like to wear.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.080]   Is that the hardest thing
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.320]   or what do you think makes it so stressful?
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.920]   - I think it's so competitive
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.280]   in the sense, I mean, even comparing it to basketball,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.720]   like there's so many hoopers out there
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.960]   and there's so many incredible basketball players,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.600]   but only like few can shine through that.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.480]   And that might be through work ethic or not giving up
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.280]   or a certain style or a certain swagger
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   that make people connect to it more.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.320]   And I think same with fashion.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.600]   There is so many brands.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.640]   I think almost every kid grows up,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.120]   like I wanna have a brand.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.840]   Like it's such a common thing.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.760]   So I think just being able to figure out
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.600]   how to shine through the rest
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.360]   and it's really about being different
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.520]   and pushing boundaries.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.040]   And like, you can't be afraid,
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.440]   just like in basketball,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.240]   you can't be afraid to take that last shot.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.760]   If you miss, you miss.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.480]   Like people might hate on you at that moment,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.920]   but if you make it, you're great.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.280]   And so I think same with putting out collections.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.360]   You can't be timid.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.680]   You gotta just really put something out that feels good
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.280]   and it might be a little scary to put out
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.680]   'cause maybe people respond poorly to it,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.040]   but maybe they absolutely love you for it.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.120]   So just put it, you know.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.480]   - That's not, that's a really good point
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.440]   because like I was watching some interview
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.360]   and it really connected with me.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.280]   And it was like the best players, basketball players,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.800]   and I'm sure, you know, it's weird.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.080]   Like an NBA, every player at some point
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.520]   was the man on their team.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.280]   So they had this trait at some point,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.320]   they probably were taking the last shot at some point,
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.560]   but the trait of being able to take on the risk
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.960]   and being confident enough to fail
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.760]   is really what makes the superstars in the NBA.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.360]   It makes the great players in the NBA.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.280]   And I'm sure it's similar like in your space,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.720]   like being confident enough in your ability
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.040]   that you're okay failing and you're okay with the backlash.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.120]   I feel like a lot of complacent people in life,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.000]   that's one of the things they lack is--
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.840]   - For sure.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.160]   - And that makes them fly under the radar.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.520]   But being able to take on that risk is an important trait.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   - Yeah, the amount of failures I've had is like,
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.560]   there's been thousands.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.200]   So I've taken every failure as a way to learn,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.040]   but yeah, it's damn near impossible
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.240]   to succeed in this business.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.920]   So just being able to eat shit day in and day out
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.760]   and just keep pushing and keep trying.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.760]   And if you give up, that's when you won't make it.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.200]   But if you keep pushing, like there is a finish line
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.840]   or not necessarily a finish line,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.640]   but you're gonna get somewhere as long as you keep pushing
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.080]   and you gotta be able to handle the failures
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.520]   and the people that are against you.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.880]   And people will come in waves of loving you or hating you
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.240]   or loving the product or hating the product.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.000]   - So.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   - That does seem stressful.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.200]   What is your ways you think of being able to deal with that?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.800]   I mean, basketball athletes have their own ways.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.680]   I'm sure you have your way.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.120]   How do you, 'cause it's a lot.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.960]   And to even maintain like joy and happiness in life,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.040]   you gotta have, is it your family, your friend?
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.880]   What is it?
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.040]   - That's what I'm, this year,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.400]   like just this past few months is like,
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   I'm really learning to be present and enjoy life for,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.560]   yeah, family, find the friends that you love
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   and figure out the things that give you peace
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.000]   and do those things.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.440]   Because I got caught, got so caught up
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.280]   just being stressed about wanting to perform
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.440]   and make sure I'd be so successful
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.360]   and I'd get this pop up and my clothes would be
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.200]   in this store.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.920]   But in the end, you get those things
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.360]   and like nothing really changed about your life
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.040]   or your heart or your wellbeing.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.480]   So the things that really mattered would be
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.880]   spending that time with your family and friends
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.720]   and loved ones.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.280]   And that's what really matters.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.320]   And then making sure your business,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.520]   your business will perform better
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.960]   if you put more attention into those things,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.280]   you know, 'cause you'll be more at peace.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.840]   And it's just kind of having that carefree feeling.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.320]   Like if it works, it works.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.440]   If it doesn't, it doesn't.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.000]   But I love what I'm doing.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.080]   And like, that's how your mentality should be.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.120]   - It's true.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.960]   And it's weird.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.760]   Like when people talk about even the law of attraction
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.400]   and things like this, the more you want something,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.800]   sometimes the more it evades you.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.240]   But the more you kind of like, you know,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.080]   put your energy into other things as well
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.560]   and kind of just, you know, like you said,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.680]   that carefree mentality.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.360]   And this is something I think I've spoken on another podcast
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.680]   but how when you're so focused on chasing something
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.560]   or like an end goal, sometimes we get those things
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.360]   and it doesn't change anything about how happy we are,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.440]   how peaceful we are.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.200]   And it's weird how some people go through their whole life
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.280]   and they think if I get this or I get this or this,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.260]   that will make me happy.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.960]   You know, as a basketball player,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.440]   I've talked about this before, you know,
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.520]   your whole life you wanna be a D1 player,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.880]   whatever it is, you get that.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.440]   Then you're like, man, I really wanna get drafted.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.760]   If I get drafted and I get some money
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.020]   and I can help my family out,
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.860]   then I'll be happy.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.020]   Then you get in the NBA and you're not playing.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.040]   Then you're like, oh, if I could just get on the court
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.300]   and be in the rotation, I'll be happy.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.440]   Then it's, I wanna be a starter.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.280]   I wanna be...
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.120]   And so the whole point is like, it never stops.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   - It never stops.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.200]   - That's the human kind of mind.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.600]   I don't know, like, I feel like in a,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.480]   over here in the Western world,
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.000]   that's probably just more of like the hustle mindset,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.120]   the American dream, like go get it mindset,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.120]   but it really kills a lot of people's ability
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   to achieve peace and happiness.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.260]   So I think-- - It's so hard to be happy, yeah.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.140]   - I think, you know, in an industry as stressful as yours,
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.500]   and we talked about this in the sauna at Voda,
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.260]   shout out to Voda Spa. - Voda.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.180]   - We go there and we have good conversations.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.100]   - Voda. - Yeah.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.720]   We just talked about like, how do you have happiness
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.940]   and peace through the midst of like
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.620]   the entire stressful process of life?
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.540]   And you kind of have come to that realization,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.020]   which I feel like is important.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.580]   - So now I'm just learning how to tackle that
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.980]   to the best of my ability, like going back on that.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.980]   For instance, we just opened up our own pop-up takeover
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.480]   at Maxfield in Los Angeles,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.100]   one of the best boutiques in the world.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.980]   Like, since I started, that was my dream.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.140]   It's like, I want my name on the window of Maxfield.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.260]   I wanna do an installation.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.780]   I wanna have a collection with them.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.820]   We just had that.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.660]   The opening night was just the other night,
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.660]   and it was amazing, but it happened, and now it's gone.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.060]   I mean, it's still up, but it just like,
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.720]   that moment happened, and it's just like, now what?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.460]   Like, now what?
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.260]   And so like, but then I had a night
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.940]   with my family and friends, and we celebrated,
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.060]   and being at home with them was almost the better moment
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.300]   than the event itself, you know?
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.740]   Like, so just finding ways to step back and breathe,
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.140]   and just, I think being present is the hardest part,
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.060]   'cause we're always consumed like on what's next,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.460]   or how am I gonna make this better?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.540]   Are people gonna like it?
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.460]   And it's really just about like,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.460]   when I spend time with you, it's just different, you know?
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.780]   - Bro, same thing.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.620]   Like, I would compare your Maxfield opening
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.500]   to like us winning the finals, right?
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.500]   Every NBA player's goal is to win a championship, you know?
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.700]   And then you do that, and then you celebrate the next day,
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.420]   and the next two days, bro, you're just at home.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.860]   Like, what's next?
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.940]   Like, what?
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.860]   And then, you know, you get to celebrate with your family,
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.060]   and you know, you have the memories,
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.660]   but even when like I saw like the Chiefs, for example,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.500]   like Patrick Mahomes,
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.940]   and then win the Super Bowl this past year,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.380]   and he was, in the press conference, he was like,
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.820]   like, we're gonna get a third one next year,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.220]   but you just won that one,
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.780]   and it's hard to even like enjoy the moment.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.140]   So it's a whole, it's just a,
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.300]   it's a crazy mindset that we have as humans.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.700]   But going back to, like you said,
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.660]   you just opened up your pop-up shop at Maxfield,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.980]   and that's a big deal, like, you know?
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.020]   - It's the Mecca.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.060]   It's like every designer's dream
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.460]   is to do a takeover with Maxfield.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.380]   - Yeah, that's huge.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.420]   How did that kind of like come about,
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.940]   and how do you see that kind of springboarding your brand
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.700]   even to bigger heights than it is?
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.180]   - I mean, that came, that's just a million baby steps,
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.180]   getting to this point.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.140]   Like, I posted on my social media,
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.420]   along with the photo of me at Maxfield,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.220]   with a swipe to the email,
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.340]   showing in 2016, 2017, 2018,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.620]   asking the buyers just for a chance,
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.540]   just to show them the collection.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.060]   Like, I was just banging my foot on the door.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.940]   And so it was just years of perseverance,
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.660]   and not giving up, and the time will come.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.060]   So I think it was just that matter
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.980]   of just not giving up on that.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.260]   - Yeah, I can't wait to go check it out.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260]   We're gonna go check it out tomorrow morning.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260]   You got the big apple in there, in the store.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.100]   Talk about that.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.300]   What is the meaning of that?
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.780]   - Yeah, I partnered with this amazing digital artist,
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.820]   Andres Rezinger, and we were conceptualizing
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.420]   how to make something super special.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.060]   But for me, the apple is a representation
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.980]   of knowledge and happiness.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.820]   Like, that's one of the two main things of the apple.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.780]   So having this moment in my career
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.620]   was like showing these past years of work.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.100]   It represents that knowledge has got me here.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.820]   And then just the happiness of being able to be here,
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.380]   and have that moment.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.340]   So I thought it'd be so impactful
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.780]   to just take that huge apple and just plant it in the store,
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.660]   plant it in the window.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.940]   'Cause that's how I would drive by this block
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.420]   and manifest it for years.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.660]   So then now I can just see it, and it's just in your face.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.820]   - Yeah, no, that's dope.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.700]   Yeah, I was wondering what that meant.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.700]   A couple other concepts that you've come up with
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.260]   is the Summerland.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.820]   You know, you got that on the hats, on the shirts.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.660]   Talk about that.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.860]   What is the meaning of Summerland?
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.580]   - Summerland, it's a small town within Santa Barbara.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.340]   I spent years growing up there.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.380]   And it's just like a small beach town,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.220]   which I feel like it defines California.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.420]   It's like a little beach, ocean,
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.580]   and then right behind you is the mountains.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.460]   And it's just so laid back and cool.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.780]   And I pull all my inspiration from it.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.420]   It's almost like this dreamland.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.540]   And I think a lot of people don't even know
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.020]   Summerland is a real town.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.860]   - Yeah, I gotta go check it out.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.380]   - So it's a real place, and it's so small,
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.940]   but it's like, it almost represents anything to anyone.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.900]   It's like, what is your dreamland?
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.220]   What's your dream state?
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.700]   Where do you want to be that makes you most at peace?
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.940]   And for me, it's going home.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.780]   - That's dope.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.700]   And then the other one is, you know,
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.900]   you got it on your hat, the miracle,
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.100]   the Miracle Academy.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.140]   You know, you have a miracle in a lot of your stuff.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.780]   What does that mean to you?
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.460]   - The miracle to me is, I mean,
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.220]   I find it to be one of the most impactful words
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.380]   in the dictionary, it's just like,
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.740]   but the fact that I'm here today
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.980]   and doing what I'm doing,
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.620]   I had a phase as a kid in my upbringing.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.820]   I was a really troubled youth teenager.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.660]   I got into a ton of trouble.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.340]   I was sent to Utah for wilderness programs.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.940]   I went to juvenile hall.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.660]   Like, I was like really a rough kid,
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.420]   and I was really lost and confused
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.340]   and getting into a lot of things I shouldn't be doing.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.260]   So just the idea of being able to turn around from that
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.260]   and basically transform into the person I am today,
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.660]   I see as a miracle.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.620]   And that's just like my little story of it,
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.460]   but it works for the business and the brand as well,
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.780]   'cause I think so many people relate to it in so many ways.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.220]   I think everyone has their own kind of miracle
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.860]   that they can relate to in their lifetime.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.660]   So it just is, yeah.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.660]   - Do you feel like,
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.140]   how much do you connect that miracle to,
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.580]   do you connect it to coincidence?
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.860]   Do you connect it to God?
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.300]   I mean, obviously me and you,
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.500]   we kick it with Jude all the time.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.500]   I know faith has become more important to you
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.780]   and you're still trying to figure it out,
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.020]   going to church and things like that,
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.740]   but kind of what is your thoughts in that space?
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   - I connect it to a little of everything.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.660]   I think I connect it to faith.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.660]   I connect it to coincidence.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.780]   I connect it to work ethic.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.300]   I connect it to kindness.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.140]   I think really the way you treat people
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.260]   is almost one of the biggest parts.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.780]   If you're loving to people and you're always outgoing,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.780]   making sure someone else is okay,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.340]   I feel like that's the best way
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.940]   that this world can be a better place.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.540]   And so I think there'll be more miracles
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.020]   the more we can be better humans to everyone else,
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.820]   'cause I think it's getting pretty rough out there.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.900]   And I think a lot of people
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.860]   are getting more and more closed off
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.860]   and more out there for themselves.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.780]   And I think if we can change
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.100]   to where more people are worried about others,
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.260]   still protect yourself,
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.020]   but there's so many people just going through it.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.260]   So just checking in on them,
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.820]   it can change a lot for everybody.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.180]   - Well, you're amazing at that.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.220]   I mean, we've talked about this in the car.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.300]   I remember me, you and Judah were sitting there
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.940]   and we were like, what do you think is,
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.100]   we were going around asking what each one thought
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.780]   each other's strengths were.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.820]   And the word that kept coming up about you
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.700]   is just how caring you are for your friends
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.500]   and your people, and that's an obvious trait about you.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.140]   All this stuff is going on in your business and stuff,
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.020]   but you still find time to make sure
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.940]   everybody else is straight. - That's right.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.900]   - And I feel, bro, that's gonna come back around.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.460]   That's why you have so many relationships that you do.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.780]   Talk about that, the relationships
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.180]   with some of these celebrities.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:53.060]   You're close with Kodak, you're close with Chris Brown,
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.380]   some of the NBA players, Justin.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.780]   How do you feel like some of those relationships
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.700]   really came about?
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.100]   Because I feel like a lot of people in this space
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.180]   are very closed off, but you come around
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.980]   and they are very open with you.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.260]   Why do you think that is?
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.300]   And how did those relationships kinda come about?
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.740]   - Man, I think I'm definitely just blessed
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.420]   in the sense of, I don't know, I think I definitely
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.780]   have a special trait of connecting with someone
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.500]   and just kind of feeling what's inside of them.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.620]   And I think they can almost see it or feel it.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.820]   I don't know what it is.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.140]   It might be a superpower I was given.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.180]   But for instance, my relationship with Kodak,
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.180]   he's a very closed off guy.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.020]   He's got a very tight circle.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.300]   But since we met, we became like bonded brothers
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.260]   and he loved me and we would have great conversation.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.340]   Even his management is just like, I don't know what it is,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.060]   but Bill loves you, you know?
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.300]   So I don't know, I think they just understand
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.660]   that I'm trying to care for them for them.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.780]   And it's like, you're an amazing rapper.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.180]   I love you for your music and your craft,
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.100]   but I also think you're great
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.780]   and I can tell you have a good heart.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.220]   So I think we connect on that level.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.300]   And that same with even Chris Brown
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.900]   and all these other guys and all these ballplayers.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.060]   I think I relate to a lot of these basketball guys.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.380]   I grew up playing basketball.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.180]   I'm not 6'10" like you, but I get buckets.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.420]   And I think I just relate.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.460]   I feel like I just connect and relate with these people
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.140]   on a natural and organic level.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.580]   And I think they just feel it.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.260]   And so it just works in my favor
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.820]   and hopefully theirs too, you know?
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.580]   It's just becomes real friendships.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.220]   - Yeah, nah, it's a gift you have for sure.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.940]   And I think in the industry you're in,
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.060]   relationships is very important, you know?
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.380]   I mean, you're in the early stages
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.220]   of kind of what this is gonna become.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.900]   And you're in the grinding stages.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.340]   You may not be making like tons, millions of dollars.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.660]   But the relationships you have, the stuff that you make,
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.900]   it's only a matter of time.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.860]   So as stressful as it is, bro,
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.980]   it's inevitable that this is gonna be the next thing.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.340]   You know, Joker talks about your stuff all the time.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.980]   You got Justin over here wearing it, Chris Brown.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.100]   You got the connections.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.900]   It's just keep it going, bro.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.100]   Your stuff is dope.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.940]   This is a question I wanna ask you
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.100]   'cause you're in the fashion industry.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.220]   Why do you think that the fashion is going sometimes
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.300]   towards this, for men's wear,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.980]   towards kind of sometimes the feminine type of stuff?
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.800]   And do you see yourself ever going in that direction
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.380]   with someone like the skirts
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.140]   or the stuff the dude's wearing fashion week?
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.980]   Do you see that?
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.820]   Why do you think that is?
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.860]   And do you see yourself ever going that way?
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.780]   - I see that, but I would never go there.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.300]   I'm always gonna stay authentic.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.020]   But I see, I think the skirts and all this stuff,
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.020]   I think that's just designers finding ways
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.980]   to push their boundaries.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.540]   How do we make something?
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.940]   How do we make some noise?
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.060]   How do we be different?
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.580]   And every designer has their way of doing it.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.580]   For me, I'm not gonna put a man in a skirt, but.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.180]   - Even like the fingernail polish,
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.940]   what do you think about all that stuff?
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.700]   - It's just, it's their taste.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.500]   I think every human has their own flavor
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.020]   of like expressing themselves.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.860]   And I have nothing against any of it.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.780]   And some people can pull it off.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.540]   Like I could, I've seen, I think like Westbrook in a skirt
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.220]   and he kind of looks dope, but it's not for me.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.260]   - Jordan Clarkson rocks sometimes.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.020]   - My brand's not gonna go there, I don't think.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.580]   But who knows, maybe in two, three years,
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:30.580]   I have some weird face and I got men in dresses.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.620]   You never know, but.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.580]   - No, I feel you.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.660]   I just always wanted to ask that
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.460]   'cause it's so funny to me how.
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.380]   - I find it funny.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.340]   I think the fashion game,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.060]   I think there's so much real stuff in it,
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.100]   but I think there's so much comical,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.660]   artificial stuff in the fashion game too.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.700]   I think there's designers that are true and authentic.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.460]   And I think there's designers that are just,
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.020]   I don't know, just a bit comical
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.740]   and just a bit artificial.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.460]   - Why do you think, like fashion goes through phases.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.380]   It used to be the baggy, the baggy stuff.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.620]   And then it went to guys wearing skinny jeans.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.180]   - I know the theory.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:14.180]   For instance, you got, I think, true, real, cool culture.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.020]   I'm talking, I guess, on a California level first.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.340]   You got skaters wearing baggy jeans
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.780]   and these puffy skate shoes.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.900]   Designers now are doing these puffy skate shoes,
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.900]   baggy jeans, and now that everyone's wearing baggy,
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.940]   now these skate cats are real street kids
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.300]   that now they go back to skinny.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.580]   So I think it's almost like a chase of the cool kids
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.780]   trying to identify on their own level.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.020]   They're going to dress their way.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.020]   That becomes commercialized.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.660]   And then it almost just goes backwards.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.740]   And it's going to be a vicious cycle forever.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.780]   And I think it's just a matter of,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.180]   there's like that core, cool community
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.980]   that paves the lane.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.460]   And then there's the designer houses
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.020]   and bigger conglomerates or whatever,
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.620]   looking at what cool kids are doing.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.660]   And then they're going to recreate it.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.820]   Maybe not as well, but it's kind of just--
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.940]   - Do you see yourself going back to the,
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.220]   'cause it is crazy how it used to be baggy.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.580]   And then that got weird kind of.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.660]   And everyone was wearing the skinny stuff,
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.820]   even the joggers, you cuff it in your shoes.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.500]   Now everybody wants the big sweats
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.340]   to go over their shoes.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.700]   Do you, when do you see it going back skinny?
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.780]   And do you see yourself following?
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.020]   I mean, I guess as a designer,
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.540]   you kind of got to go with the culture.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.420]   But when do you see that kind of happening?
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.060]   'Cause it's just, I feel like it's so weird.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.420]   'Cause I used to think skinny was so dope
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.740]   and now I can't stand it.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.580]   - Can't stand it.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.420]   - And then we're baggy.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.660]   - People be looking goofy.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.740]   They look like Dr. Grew from the '80s.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.580]   - Right.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.540]   When do you see it going back that way?
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.740]   - I mean, skinny's coming back.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.140]   I think there's always going to be,
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.220]   there's certain designers that'll stick to their core.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.140]   You got Hedy Slimane,
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.860]   like he's going to have skinny jeans forever.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.020]   And there's other designers that will have skinny,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.820]   but as a brand and a business in the end,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.660]   they're going to have to cater to an audience
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.700]   and sell what they can.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.700]   So I see skinny coming back in a sense.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.540]   I don't know if I'm going to play with it,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.060]   but I've always worn baggy clothes.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.020]   Even in high school,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.980]   there was like this phase of crew jeans,
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.660]   these crew skinny jeans.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.220]   I just made fun of my friends forever for it.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.380]   And I just never got there,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.740]   but everyone has their taste.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.580]   - Yeah, the baggy's definitely doper.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.020]   All right, man, my last question for you.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.980]   What is your overall vision for Nemeas
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.660]   and kind of your purpose for the brand overall,
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.260]   for you overall?
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.220]   What is your purpose?
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.660]   And then what is the vision for the entire brand?
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:42.660]   - My vision for the brand is to make it as big as possible,
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.620]   but still holding its authentic feel and love.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.740]   And like in the end, it is a business.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.940]   I want it to make money.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.100]   I want the world to know about it.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.900]   I want people to wear it and feel comfortable
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.620]   and confident wearing it.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.700]   So as big as Nemeas can go,
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.380]   where it'll still feel authentic,
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.620]   like I want it there.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.020]   And me as a human and as a person with a purpose,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.940]   it's definitely going beyond clothing.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.940]   I wanna explore everything from fashion to charity,
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.620]   to organization, to furniture, different forms of art.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.780]   Like this is just the start for me.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.860]   And this is like my home base to build myself as a person
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.820]   and then see what else I could do.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.300]   I got plenty of time.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.020]   I just turned 31.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.340]   But I see something greater
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.540]   with this whole Miracle and Miracle Academy.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.700]   I see it as a, almost like a charity program or a situation.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.100]   We also have Miracle Garden and it's like,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.620]   so there's so many things I wanna play with
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.540]   and explore in the future beyond clothing.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.580]   - Yeah, and I mean, I just gotta point out
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.420]   something you just said that just hit me
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.780]   was the fact that you use this fashion brand
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.740]   and what you're doing to shape you as a human
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.300]   for some of the other things that you wanna do in life.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.900]   And like for me or anyone, I think that's important.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.020]   Like not letting what you do become your sole identity
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.980]   to where it's all-consuming.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.540]   Like me, I should be using basketball
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.660]   to help me grow mentally,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.420]   to help me fulfill my purpose in other areas.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.140]   Inspiring people, giving back to the people
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.100]   through charity and things.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.060]   So I think that's important 'cause a lot of people,
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.340]   what they do is who they are.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.100]   And you just said, you know, you use,
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.940]   and it means you use this fashion
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.540]   to explore who you are, grow who you are
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.300]   so you can ultimately reach your purpose.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.740]   So man, I admire you, bro.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.580]   - I love you, bro.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.420]   - I appreciate you getting on the podcast, dog.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.260]   - I love you, bro.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.100]   - My man.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.100]   - I already gave up my dreams of being in the NBA,
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.460]   so at least I can make some clothes for the NBA players
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.420]   and everybody else.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.420]   - Appreciate you, dog.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.580]   Curious Mike out.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.900]   - I drink one of these smoothies every day.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.660]   Banana, blueberry.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:11.340]   It's tough, tough life out here.
