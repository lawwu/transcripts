[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.800]   All right, our first speaker, Mary Beth Franklin,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.740]   is a contributing editor at Investment News,
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.220]   specializes in Social Security,
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.040]   Medicare, and retirement income.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.820]   She's been a financial journalist for more than 40 years,
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.760]   and has covered everything from federal budget
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.960]   and tax policies to consumer finances.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.260]   She's been an editor at Kiplinger's.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.120]   She became a certified financial planner in 2015,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.460]   is now an in-demand speaker at conferences
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.100]   just like this one all over the place.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.040]   She's a frequent guest on radio and TV.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.340]   She's a host of the Retirement Repair Shop podcast.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.680]   In her free time, she likes to read, garden,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.980]   ski, and play the piano.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.620]   Mary Beth Franklin, come on up.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.180]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.220]   You probably heard yesterday that the cost
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.420]   of living adjustment for Social Security for 2024
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.400]   was just announced, 3.2% as we had expected.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.060]   Now, yeah, it's less than half than the 8.7%
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.500]   we got this year, but keep in mind,
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.840]   it's also larger than the average cost
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.380]   of living adjustments over the last 20 years,
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.780]   which was about 2.6%.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.520]   So, yay for people collecting Social Security.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.280]   They will actually get a bump about 59 bucks a month
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480]   for the average Social Security benefit.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520]   Now, of course, that's only one piece of the puzzle.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.780]   For those of you who are collecting Social Security,
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.120]   you know that your Medicare Part B premiums
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.560]   are deducted from those Social Security benefits.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.660]   Now, we normally don't know till about Thanksgiving
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.800]   what those premiums are going to be.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.100]   Always something to talk to your friends and family
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.400]   about at Thanksgiving.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.700]   But surprise, this morning on the way here,
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.780]   they announced the Medicare Part B premiums for next year.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.440]   And they are merely going up by about $10 a month.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.720]   So, that's good news.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.160]   The average Medicare Part B premium
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.560]   will be roughly $175 a month next year.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.120]   That goes up by 10 bucks.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.220]   The Social Security benefits going up by more than 50.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.400]   So, most of you will have a net increase
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.060]   in your Social Security benefits.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.900]   However, because you're successful investors
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.940]   and may be paying high income surcharges,
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.780]   known as Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, or IRMA,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.020]   as in a hurricane for your healthcare cost of retirement,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.620]   they also announced that the new IRMA surcharges
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.620]   will start at a new threshold of $103,000 a month for singles,
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.020]   $206,000 for married couples.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.860]   So, that may mean, depending on your income,
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.160]   that if you were paying IRMA this year,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.500]   you might slip into a lower bracket
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.540]   or possibly disappear altogether.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.300]   I know when I do my income taxes,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.640]   I care less about the tax brackets
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.540]   and a whole lot about those IRMA surcharges
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.040]   and do whatever I can as a self-employed person
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.780]   with a solo 401(k)
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420]   to get the numbers below those thresholds.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.880]   But today, we're really talking about Social Security.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.760]   And obviously, I'm clicker happy here.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.960]   We're gonna learn how the claiming age,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.360]   marital status, and earnings limit
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.000]   affect the amount of Social Security benefits.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.160]   You're also going to discover how claiming strategies
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.000]   for married couples, and in some cases,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.040]   eligible divorce spouses,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.100]   may be able to maximize Social Security benefits
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.120]   over two lifetimes.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.780]   And I really want you all to understand
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.480]   that Social Security retirement benefits
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.080]   and Social Security survivor benefits
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.320]   are two different pots of money.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.180]   And depending on your individual circumstances,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.960]   it's quite possible you may be able to claim
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.860]   one type of benefit first
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.960]   and switch to the other larger benefit later.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.000]   You can do it in either order.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.300]   And I'll give you an example in a few minutes.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.300]   The key is how do you become eligible for Social Security?
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.200]   This is you-must-pay-to-play kind of game.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.840]   You have to work in covered employment
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.220]   for essentially at least 10 years
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.060]   to earn the minimum number of 40 credits of covered work.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.660]   You can earn up to four credits per year.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.660]   Therefore, you have to work about 10 years
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.360]   to get these 40 credits.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.660]   But that does not tell you
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.060]   how much you will get in retirement.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.100]   Your actual benefits are based
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.540]   on your average lifetime earnings,
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.180]   which Social Security defines
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.980]   as your top 35 years of index earnings.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.780]   So you work 40 years,
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.120]   those low-earning years when you're flipping burgers
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.240]   and delivering newspapers.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.080]   Remember those?
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.420]   I used to write for those.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.220]   So those low-earning years go away
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.820]   and they base your future benefits
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.260]   on your highest 35 years.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.100]   But again, that still doesn't tell you
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.860]   how much you're going to get each month
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.240]   because the key is how old are you
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.600]   when you claim your benefits.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.040]   And you all know,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.240]   my clicker just stopped working.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.140]   Is that a reason?
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.040]   Okay, help from the back.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.540]   You all know that you can claim benefits as early,
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.920]   maybe it's a power thing.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.320]   Oh, that works.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.220]   You can claim benefits as early as age 62,
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.260]   but I bet a whole lot of people in this room
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.820]   don't plan to do that.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.460]   Because if you claim benefits at the earliest age of 62,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.860]   your benefits are permanently reduced
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.540]   by up to 30% for the rest of your life.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.680]   And if you claim benefits early and continue to work,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.640]   which I think is a really bad idea,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.420]   you are also subject to earnings restrictions.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.720]   If you make too much, which is about $22,000 a year now,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.580]   you will start losing some or all of your benefits,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.580]   at least temporarily, due to the earnings cap.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.620]   Now, if you wait to your full retirement age,
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.300]   which is anywhere between 66 and 67,
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.960]   depending on when you were born,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.660]   then you get 100% of those benefits
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.260]   that you worked so hard for
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.860]   and paid so much for in the form of FICA taxes.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.840]   And even if you continue to work,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   you can keep all those benefits
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.800]   because earnings restrictions go away
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.100]   once you reach your full retirement age.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.840]   But for those people who are willing and able
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.920]   to delay collecting up until age 70,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.220]   there is a huge bonus.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.220]   You earn an extra 8% per year.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.800]   For every year, you postpone claiming
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.300]   beyond your full retirement age up until age 70.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.000]   So for somebody like me, whose full retirement age is 66,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.700]   waiting till 70 means a 32% increase
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.500]   in my monthly benefits for the rest of my life.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.640]   Now, I suspect some of you in here
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.840]   were born in 1960 or later,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   in which case your full retirement age is 67.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.780]   It also means that, yes,
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.220]   you can earn delayed retirement credits,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.060]   but unlike me, you're not going to get a 32% increase
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.660]   because if your full retirement age is 67,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.520]   you only have three years between 67 and 70
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.100]   for a maximum of a 24% increase.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.060]   And people will often say to me,
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.540]   "Hey, my full retirement age is 67.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.900]   "Should I wait until 70 to claim?"
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.800]   And my answer is always the same.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.040]   I have no idea.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.840]   It will all depend on what interest rates are at the time.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.280]   Now, for the past decade,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.780]   we have been living in a zero interest rate environment.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.160]   So for people whose full retirement age was 66
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.960]   and who had other sources of income
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.720]   and were relatively healthy,
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.820]   hey, waiting till 70 to collect 8% a year
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.760]   was a slam dunk decision.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.800]   We are now getting to 5% plus in interest rates
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.100]   on fixed investments, like a CD.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.780]   So this decision may be a little less tantalizing
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.580]   going forward.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.320]   This is the most powerful graphic I can show you.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.680]   The difference between claiming your benefits
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.440]   as soon as possible at age 62
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.280]   versus waiting until the maximum age of 70
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.740]   increases your social security benefits
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.380]   by 76% per month for the rest of your life.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.460]   Now, as a certified financial planner,
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.560]   there is no investment I can suggest to you
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.120]   that is going to increase your income by 76%,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.100]   essentially over an eight-year investment period.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.660]   But instead of investing your money,
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.000]   you're investing your life.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.160]   Now, who gets those delayed retirement credits?
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.040]   It's very important to understand
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.900]   they are delayed retirement credits.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.180]   They only apply to a worker's own retirement benefit.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.420]   If I am not eligible for social security
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.880]   on my own earnings record,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.320]   or I am, but it's a small benefit,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.780]   and I'm married,
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.220]   well, I'm also entitled to a benefit as a spouse.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   My spousal benefit is worth up to 50% of my working spouse,
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.020]   my husband, my wife's full retirement age benefit.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.760]   But that maximum amount
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.100]   is if I claim at my full retirement age.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.480]   It does not continue to grow by 8% a year up until age 70.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.380]   That only applies to a worker's own benefit.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.040]   Same thing with survivor benefits.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   If I am a surviving spouse,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.720]   or in some cases, an eligible surviving ex-spouse,
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.420]   my survivor benefit is worth up to 100%
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.260]   of what my late husband, late wife, late ex
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.700]   was entitled to if I claim it at my full retirement age.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.700]   It does not continue to grow.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.300]   I cannot tell you how many financial advisors
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.660]   I have talked to who said,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.040]   well, my client was recently widowed,
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.700]   and I told her to wait till 70
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.140]   to get the biggest survivor benefit possible.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.140]   No, you don't.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.700]   The biggest survivor benefit
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.980]   is if he or she claims at her full retirement age.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.040]   It does not continue to grow.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.020]   So the big question for everybody here is should you delay?
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.720]   Certainly the pros are the longer you wait up until age 70,
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.620]   the bigger the benefit you get.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.820]   And by having a bigger benefit each year
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.800]   when there's a cost of living adjustment,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.260]   that percentage is applied to a bigger base.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.700]   So in dollar terms,
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.900]   you end up with a bigger increase each year.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.640]   It's also very important for married couples to consider,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.520]   because if you have at least one spouse,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.880]   preferably the one with the bigger Social Security benefit,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.680]   who tends to be the man, who is often the higher earner,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.360]   and who, sorry guys, actually is going to die first.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.620]   That's the person you want to wait till age 70,
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.560]   because you're creating the biggest retirement benefit
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.640]   during that person's lifetime.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.540]   And if that person dies first,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.580]   it is now creating the largest possible survivor benefit
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.700]   for the spouse left behind.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.140]   Now, it's not a slam dunk decision.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.120]   Hey, if you need the money, that's what it's there for.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.540]   Go ahead and take it.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.780]   And I'll tell you a few secrets at the end of this
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.520]   of how to reverse that decision if you change your mind.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.960]   If you're in poor health,
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.600]   the whole idea is waiting until age 70
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.660]   to collect the biggest benefit possible
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.340]   is a bit like the lottery.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.240]   You must be present to win.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.940]   If you don't think you're going to be around a long time,
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.740]   maybe you don't want to wait.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.900]   And a lot of people really freak out
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.140]   at the idea of dying before they claim.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.340]   I usually say to them, what do you care?
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.180]   You're dead.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.620]   Your spouse will be real happy if you wait until 70.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.900]   And then they say, well, what's the breakeven age?
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.220]   You're a bunch of engineers and nerds out there.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.820]   I know you asked that question.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.380]   So yeah, frankly, how long do I have to live
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.560]   to make the decision worthwhile to delay those benefits?
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.700]   The difference between claiming at 62
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.540]   and full retirement age is roughly you have to live till 78.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.300]   Anything past that is gravely you would have gotten more
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.660]   in social security benefits over your lifetime.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.120]   78 is less than the average life expectancy,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.780]   which is about 86 for a 65-year-old woman,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.540]   84 for a 65-year-old man.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.140]   What about the difference between claiming at 62 versus 70?
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.740]   Yes, you have to live till about 83
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.500]   to make that a worthwhile decision.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.020]   Again, less than average life expectancy.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.060]   Think about this from a married couple standpoint.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.500]   That breakeven age is essentially spread over two lives
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.680]   because someone is likely to get the survivor benefit.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.380]   I just briefly mentioned the earnings cap.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.060]   If you claim benefits before your full retirement age
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.500]   and continue to work and have earnings
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.180]   from a job or self-employment,
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.720]   not other types of earnings like pension,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.780]   other government benefits, investing, none of those count.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.980]   But if you claim benefits before your full retirement age
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.900]   and continue to work and make too much money,
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.380]   this year it's about $21,000 a year,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.020]   next year it's about $22,000 a year,
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.420]   now you're gonna lose some or all of your benefits,
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.880]   but not forever.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.140]   Once you reach your full retirement age,
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.020]   social security will recalculate your benefit
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.580]   and they'll say, "Hey, Mr. Johnson,
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.020]   "I see you claimed your benefits at 62
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   "and you took a 30% haircut.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.640]   "But I also see that over the last several years,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.260]   "you have forfeited two years worth of benefits
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.200]   "due to excess earnings."
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.920]   So now going forward, you reach your full retirement age,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.120]   we're gonna pretend that instead of claiming at 62
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.160]   and taking a 30% haircut,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.760]   you claimed at 64 and take a smaller haircut going forward.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.360]   So benefits you have lost due to excess earnings
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.740]   are restored to you in the form
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.000]   of larger monthly benefits going forward.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.240]   So my number one rule, as I mentioned before,
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.360]   is if you're gonna keep working,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.020]   don't collect social security.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.800]   It's simply an accounting nightmare and not worth it.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.860]   I also mentioned,
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.940]   and I'm trying to be really good on time here,
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.900]   strategies for married couples
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.380]   that it makes most sense for one spouse,
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.020]   preferably the one with the biggest benefit,
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.140]   to wait up until age 70,
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.580]   to lock in not only the maximum retirement benefit
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.740]   during your life,
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.940]   but potentially the largest survivor benefit
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.060]   for the spouse left behind.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.820]   But having said that,
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.420]   it might make sense for the other spouse,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.920]   the lower earning spouse,
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.620]   to go ahead and collect benefits early at 62,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.460]   if he or she is no longer working,
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.340]   or at full retirement age, if they are still working,
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.940]   it brings some cashflow into the household,
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.600]   takes away a bit of the sting
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.580]   of having the other spouse wait till 70,
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.300]   and there's no downside.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.260]   Because even though that wife, let's say,
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.700]   claims her own retirement benefits early at 62,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.700]   and those retirement benefits are permanently reduced
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.940]   for the rest of her life,
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.580]   it will have no impact on her survivor benefit
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.000]   if she is at least full retirement age at the time.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.640]   So she could collect reduced retirement benefits first,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.380]   and when she becomes widowed,
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.060]   she could collect full survivor benefits
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.320]   worth up to 100% of what her late spouse was collecting.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.340]   Now, if you're like a typical dual income couple,
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.200]   many wives have worked all their lives,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.980]   and often not making as much as their husband.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.580]   They may have their own retirement benefit,
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.100]   and they are also entitled to a spousal benefit
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   because they are married.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.860]   So if my own retirement benefit
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.200]   is bigger than half of my husband's,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.020]   that spousal benefit goes to waste.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.540]   I just get my own retirement benefit.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.900]   If, however, my own retirement benefit is smaller,
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.540]   and once my husband claims his,
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.220]   it's gonna trigger a spousal benefit for me.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.620]   So I am gonna get the larger of the two amounts.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.000]   But let's say I was a stay-at-home spouse,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   take care of the kids,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.940]   never earned my own retirement benefit.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.160]   Sure, I am entitled to a spousal benefit
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.620]   once my husband claims his to trigger a benefit for me.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.100]   So in couples like that,
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.060]   it might not make sense for the husband
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.960]   to wait till 70 to claim
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.500]   because the other spouse also has to wait
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.620]   for him to claim before she gets her benefit.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.540]   You might wanna look at
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.940]   your other sources of retirement income.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.260]   How do we make this plan work?
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.900]   The goal of most married couples should be
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.100]   how do I maximize the survivor benefit?
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.900]   I do this by having one spouse wait until 70
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.220]   to claim the biggest amount.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.740]   Now, here's my favorite part, rules for divorce spouses.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.180]   I will say that I personally have been married for 45 years,
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.580]   so it does not apply to me.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.420]   Yes, that is Purple Heart territory in some cases.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.220]   I have two best girlfriends
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.500]   who are each married nine and a half years,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.580]   and apparently their divorce attorney never told them
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.720]   that they had to be married at least 10 years
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.060]   in order to be able to claim benefits
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.340]   on an ex-spouse's record.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.020]   So if you remember nothing else from my presentation,
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.780]   tell your friends, families, girlfriends,
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.620]   everyone around here that the rule for social security
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.940]   is there must be at least a decade
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.860]   between I do and I don't.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.520]   If your marriage is falling apart in years eight and nine,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.540]   string out the paperwork.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.340]   The only dates that married
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.480]   are the day you walk down that aisle
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.180]   and the date of your final divorce decree.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.900]   I have had financial planners
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.220]   send me information about their clients,
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.260]   and I will see there might be nine years,
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.300]   11 months, in 29 days, they will get squat.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.540]   Don't let that happen to your friends and family.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.820]   So here's the basic rule.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.680]   If you had been married at least 10 years,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.180]   divorced, and currently single,
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:02.020]   you may be eligible to collect on your ex's earnings record
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.380]   if it is larger than your own.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.900]   Now, if you remember and mentioned that for married couples,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.580]   currently married couples,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.160]   if one spouse is not eligible
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.260]   for her own retirement benefit,
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.580]   she can still get it as a spouse.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.580]   Well, imagine a really nasty divorce,
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.500]   and one ex-spouse says to the other,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.140]   "I am never gonna retire,
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.460]   "and you are never gonna get a dime on my social security."
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.980]   Well, Congress thought that was a problem.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.820]   So among the 2,700 rules that govern social security benefits
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.460]   there are a lot of exceptions,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.660]   and a lot of the exceptions apply to divorced spouses.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.080]   So here's the first one.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.500]   In addition to being married at least 10 years,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.820]   divorced, and currently single,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.260]   if you had been divorced at least two years,
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.860]   and you're each at least 62 years old,
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.340]   and therefore eligible for social security,
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.100]   you can collect on your ex
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.580]   even if your ex has not yet claimed.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.500]   You are known as an independently entitled spouse.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.740]   Well, what about if your ex dies?
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.400]   This is the silver lining for divorced spouses.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.460]   Here's a little refresher course.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.140]   Your spousal benefit while your ex is alive
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.820]   is worth 50% of his or her full retirement benefit.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.540]   Your survivor benefit after your ex dies
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.180]   is worth 100% of your survivor benefits.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.580]   You're all math geniuses out there.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.260]   Yes, your ex is worth twice as much dead than alive.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.780]   But you probably knew that anyway.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.360]   One other weird little exception for divorced spouses,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.140]   I told you, you must be married at least 10 years,
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.340]   divorced, and currently single to collect on a living ex.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.700]   But guess what?
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.020]   If you wait till age 60 or later to remarry,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.140]   you still can't collect on a living ex,
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.460]   but you can collect on a dead ex
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.860]   even if you're married to someone else.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.220]   I don't make up the rules,
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.780]   I just try to explain the madness.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.700]   And as I mentioned, if you're entitled
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.820]   to a survivor benefit and a retirement benefit,
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.100]   you may be able to claim one first
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.260]   and switch to the other later.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.200]   Two minutes left?
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.700]   Four minutes, oh, I can do a lot in that.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.820]   For example, let's say my husband has died.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.460]   I'm a 62-year-old widow.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.220]   I have my own retirement benefit,
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.900]   but I'm not working at the moment.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.380]   My benefit as a survivor is much bigger.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.540]   What should I do?
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.100]   I would say claim your reduced retirement benefit right now,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.740]   and even though it's permanently reduced,
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.820]   don't worry about it
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.180]   because when you get to your full retirement age,
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.980]   you are now going to switch to your full survivor benefit
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.980]   worth 100% of what your late husband was entitled to
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.280]   or was claiming at the time he died.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.780]   But what happens if you're a business executive?
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.260]   You've lost your wife to breast cancer when she's young.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.980]   You're also entitled to a survivor benefit,
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.180]   but hey, you're still working,
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.680]   you're making a lot of money, what should you do?
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.700]   When you reach your full retirement age,
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.060]   when the earnings restrictions go away,
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.860]   you should claim your full survivor benefit.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.980]   But in the meantime, your own retirement benefit
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.260]   continues to grow by 8% a year up until age 70,
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.100]   and then at age 70, you would switch.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.220]   And for the singles out there, got nothing for you.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.220]   It all comes down to what is your average lifetime earnings
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.060]   and the age when you claim.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.140]   I would say absolutely try to wait
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.340]   till at least your full retirement age to claim.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.660]   Remember, that's when the earnings restrictions go away,
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.460]   so even if you continue to work,
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   you could claim at full retirement age.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.220]   Do you wanna wait till 70?
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.500]   That's a tougher decision for singles.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   Yes, certainly you will get a bigger benefit,
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.900]   but if you happen to die before you claim,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.760]   you do not have any survivors
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.980]   and that money just goes back into the social security pool.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.220]   So for a lot of singles, they feel more comfortable
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.780]   claiming at full retirement age,
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.700]   even if they don't need the money,
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.980]   and then they can bank it,
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.940]   and now at least you're gonna get about 5.5% in a CD.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.340]   For any of you people who were public employees
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.620]   in states that don't pay into the social security system,
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.540]   California, Texas, Louisiana,
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.800]   a bunch of the New England states, Illinois, Ohio,
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.460]   if you receive a public pension based on work
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.460]   where you didn't pay FICA taxes
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.340]   and you also entitled the social security benefit,
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.860]   you'll get it, but it will be reduced.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.620]   If on the other hand, you have a public pension
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.380]   based on work where you didn't pay FICA taxes
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.100]   and now you try to claim as a spouse or a survivor,
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.700]   probably not gonna get anything
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.820]   'cause the very onerous government pension offset,
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.900]   GPO, also known as grumpy partner rule,
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.060]   says that if I have a public pension
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.300]   based on work where I didn't pay FICA,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.340]   social security is first gonna reduce any potential benefit
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.480]   by 2/3 of the amount of my pension.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.360]   My pension is $6,000 a month,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.700]   2/3 of that is $4,000 a month,
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.420]   subtracted from a potential social security spousal,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.140]   survivor benefit, probably gonna wipe it out.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.380]   So the planning key there is if you're in a married couple
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.700]   where you have one public employee
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.340]   who is not likely to be eligible for a survivor benefit,
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.220]   then you and the private sector
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.460]   may not wanna delay till 70
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   because one of the goals
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.180]   is to maximize the survivor benefit.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.520]   But if your surviving spouse can't get it,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.840]   I'd say take it at full retirement age
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.660]   and enjoy your retirement.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.220]   I will stop there because I'm right at my time.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.980]   There are more slides here.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.460]   Feel free to review them and ask me questions later.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.300]   Thank you.

[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.460]   (audience cheering)
