[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:25.360]   going to have a lot of fun, so let's get started.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.440]   Hello Martinis and Your Money listeners. In case you didn't know, September is Life Insurance
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.840]   Awareness Month, and as a financial planner, life insurance is near and dear to my heart,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.040]   not only for my family's financial health, but also the financial health of my clients'
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.360]   families. So I'm excited to tell you that today's episode is being brought to you by

[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.360]   Today I'm talking to Joshua Sheets, founder of the website and podcast Radical Personal
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.200]   Finance about life insurance. I've talked about this topic on the podcast in the past
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.000]   and I wanted to go into greater depth with Joshua and speak more to the choices between
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.480]   whole life and term life and when life insurance makes sense as an investment. Josh's years
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.840]   of training and education in life insurance were clear in our conversation, and I think
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.040]   this is a valuable conversation for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with their life
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.440]   insurance knowledge. And now here's Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.120]   Welcome to the show, Josh.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.560]   I'm so glad to have you. It's been a year since we were sitting next to each other at
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.600]   FinCon when I was just starting to think about podcasting, and I'm excited to now have you
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   on my podcast.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.520]   I'm glad that you're doing it. We need lots and lots more people to build new financial
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.000]   blogs, new financial podcasts, and to diversify the sources of information. So I'm glad that
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   you're doing it. I'd love to see thousands more people step into this ring as well.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.880]   I totally agree. The more the merrier, right? Everybody's always like, "Oh, is it too saturated?"
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.520]   I feel like it's never saturated. Everybody's got a unique voice and perspective.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.200]   Right. There are different people who will come from different perspectives, and all
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.680]   of us are going to relate more with a certain background. So I've got a certain background
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   and a way of expressing thoughts that is perfect for some people, and there are some people
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   who cannot stand the low IT things. And I look at some financial shows out there and
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.960]   say, "I would never in my life listen to that show." But yet I know they have a real
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.880]   audience. And so I love the fact that we've eliminated the barrier between somebody who
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.000]   is an expert or a content creator and the individual listening. And so we need more
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.160]   and more competition. I'm a big free market guy, and I love the competition.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.040]   I love it. And you used to be a financial advisor like me, and we used to say in the
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.480]   industry, "There's a client for every advisor. There's someone for everyone." And my listeners
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.560]   are probably all people who love to drink, since I do.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   That works.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.880]   And I'm bringing you into the fold today. So what are you drinking with me today?
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.160]   I have got a beautiful, let's see, it's a blue hefty cup here filled with crystal clear,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160]   perfect water.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.440]   Wow. Is it Florida's finest?
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.840]   It is tap water run through my filtration system. I should have been better prepared
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.920]   and made myself a nice white Russian or something, but I didn't.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.640]   Wait, so is a white Russian your go-to drink if you were to have a cocktail?
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.320]   It is. And the story behind that, I'm not much of a drinker, but one time I had a sales
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   job when I was in college, and I really have never been a drinker. But at this job, part
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.000]   of my job description was to go to cocktail parties and do the how are you's and who are
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.160]   you's with some people who were there. And so I needed to have a drink in my hand, and
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.040]   I never ordered a drink in my life. And so I walked up to the bar to order a drink, and
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.000]   I didn't know what to order. So the guy beside me ordered a white Russian. And I was like,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.240]   I'll have a white Russian. So I got one and I tasted it. I said, wow, this is delicious.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.560]   And to this day, I don't know how many years later that still, if I'm going to order a
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.400]   drink, it's often going to be a white Russian or a glass of red wine.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.800]   That's hysterical. That's like how I got into Malibu Bay Breezes. That was my first underage
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.880]   drinking experience. I was like, oh yeah. Somebody's like, oh, just drink a Bay Breeze.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.720]   It doesn't taste like liquor at all. It's funny how much of drinking is all about the
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.880]   image and the status. And there I was. I didn't have a clue. Like, what are the names of drinks?
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.560]   I don't know. And the white Russian is such a peculiar drink, too. I mean, it's delicious.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.120]   It's like dessert in a drink. That's funny. I love it. Well, I'm drinking my go-to. Well,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.480]   I've got a lot of go-to's. This one is just a vodka tonic. I'm a big vodka fan. I'm a
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.320]   clear liquor fan. A long story that I don't think I've yet shared on the podcast. One
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.520]   day I will share it of why I only drink. I say it's the only way I'm prejudiced is in
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.600]   my alcohol. I only drink the clear stuff. So the brown stuff's got me in trouble in
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.640]   the past. I believe it. So, well, I'm excited to have you on because this show is airing
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.120]   in September. And September is Life Insurance Month, which is a very exciting topic to the
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.240]   two of us who are financial planners and know the importance of it, but probably not really
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.160]   exciting to the general population. I love the topic. Even if you're not excited, I'm
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.840]   pretty passionate about life insurance. So I'll do my best to make it interesting. I
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.480]   need you to bring your egg in because you used to work for Northwestern Mutual. Yeah,
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.200]   I spent six years as a financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual. And I probably, as an
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.120]   introduction to the topic of life insurance, I probably should give a quick background
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.080]   on my history in the industry.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.920]   Please do. I'd love it.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.360]   Because life insurance is one of the most emotionally charged issues. And people often
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.520]   have very strong opinions and perspectives on it, specifically with regard to what type
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.720]   of life insurance you should buy. There's a lot of reasons for it, but people have strong
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.560]   opinions. And what's interesting is, as a young man, I was always a buy term and invest
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.920]   the difference guy, which is one of the most strongly held perspectives. And I couldn't
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   conceive of why anybody would think anything else other than that because I was profoundly
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.880]   convinced that the only type of life insurance you ever bought was term life insurance and
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.680]   everything else was a total waste of money and a total rip off. And then I met people
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.880]   who were on exactly the opposite side who would say, "Why would anybody buy term insurance?"
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.000]   There are strong opinions.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.920]   Very strong. And so I was always a personal finance junkie. From my early teens, I was
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.680]   the nerd who probably when I should have been out playing football, I was reading books
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.000]   on personal finance. So at that time, I primarily consumed mainstream personal finance books,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.040]   something like David Box, The Automatic Millionaire or Millionaire Next Door, Think Thomas Stanley,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.160]   things like that, just mainstream perspectives. And that served me well up until I was in
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.960]   college. And in my middle years of college, I had kind of an up and down financial life
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.640]   in my own personal finances. But in my middle years of college, I got turned on to The Dave
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.760]   Ramsey Show by my brother who gave me a copy of the book Total Money Makeover. And that
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.600]   book really inspired me to get out of debt. And it also shaped a lot of my own personal
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.160]   financial philosophy because at that time when I was working to pay off my debt, I was
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.920]   listening to Dave Ramsey every day for about the podcast of his three-hour show. And I
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.000]   just consumed thousands of hours of his content. Yeah, thousands wouldn't be an exaggeration.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.160]   I would say thousands of hours. And so I was very strongly, with regard to life insurance,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.440]   I was very strongly persuaded of his perspective which is always buy term life insurance.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.240]   After college, I worked for a little while in the corporate world and I knew that I didn't
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.720]   want to work in the corporate space anymore. I wanted to run my own business and I got
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.640]   laid off from a job. And when I was deciding what my next move was, I decided to go into
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.800]   the financial services business. And I was recruited by a few different companies and
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.160]   the company that I chose to join was a company called Northwestern Mutual. Now, Northwestern
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.700]   is one of the leaders in the life insurance business. That's their heritage, is as a life
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.480]   insurance company. And ever since 1999 with the Financial Services Modernization Act,
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   all basically prior to 1999, if you were an insurance company, you did insurance. If you
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.800]   were an investment company, you did investments. And if you were a bank, you did banking. Well
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.600]   now since that time, everything's all mixed up. So your insurance agent sells you investments
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.020]   and refers you to their banker. You buy life insurance in the lobby of your bank and everything's
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.020]   all mixed up.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.520]   The one-stop shop now.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.340]   Exactly. But the heritage of Northwestern Mutual was as a life insurance company and
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.120]   they are known as one of the largest providers of whole life insurance. And I knew that going
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.300]   in based upon my company research. So I interviewed with four different recruiters and advisors
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.900]   as part of my interview process. And the question that I had for all of them was I said, "I
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.540]   don't believe that I could ethically sell whole life insurance because I don't 'believe'
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.580]   in the product." It's almost like it's a religious conviction. I don't believe in it. And I said,
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.900]   "Tell me why I'm wrong." And here I was sitting with some very smart, very experienced people.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.300]   Some would say very biased, but I'd say smart and experienced. And all of them shared with
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.220]   me thoughts and ideas and perspectives that I never knew.
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.980]   Concurrently, I was actually interviewing with other companies including Primerica,
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.620]   which is the exact opposite. They're almost arch enemies, Northwestern Mutual and Primerica
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.620]   because Primerica only sells term life insurance and Northwestern Mutual, their main flagship
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.980]   product is whole life insurance. So I had a very interesting exposure to the industry.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:18.460]   So I did a lot of research about insurance products to try to understand what was I missing.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.980]   And then I went on to build a career. I decided that I learned enough about whole life insurance
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.740]   to be satisfied that it wasn't an ethically wrong product. It wasn't like it was a terrible
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.340]   product and I can share some of the reasons why. But it did need to be rightly used.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.540]   So I built a business with Northwestern Mutual for the first few years focusing primarily
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.540]   on insurance sales, life insurance, disability insurance and long term care insurance. Then
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.060]   after a few years, when I started I was a young and green 23 year old newbie. And then
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.060]   I spent a lot of time studying and a lot of time working hard and learning my craft. And
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.900]   then I transitioned to more of a wealth management practice for another three to four years.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.400]   So I spent a total of six years there. And at that point in time, I closed my practice
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.880]   to launch Radical Personal Finance. And that's what I've been doing for the last year and
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   a half now.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.860]   And you just gave my listeners exactly why I have you on for this conversation. So I'm
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.380]   even more excited. I knew this about your background and I appreciate you sharing it.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:20.100]   I've talked about life insurance on the podcast in the past and just life insurance in general
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:26.900]   because step one is thinking about life insurance, I think. And then I really wanted to do this
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:33.980]   next level, dive deeper because I see this all the time with my clients. Some of them
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.940]   don't even know they should have life insurance or don't understand the importance of it.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:42.220]   So that was the first podcast was let's address life insurance. And now this is step two is
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.340]   like, okay, what type of life insurance is right for me? And I think, and there's all,
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.540]   like we said, there's opinions on either side. And I think it gets very confusing for some
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:59.100]   people. And we both know that there are persuasive arguments on both sides, rightly, wrongly,
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.540]   and it gets people confused. And I really wanted to have kind of more of an in-depth
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:09.060]   conversation about life insurance to help people really understand why term, why whole
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:15.900]   life, when does it make sense and kind of how to understand the difference, the differences
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:22.980]   and the nuances. So I, so the first question I really have for you is why do you think
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.580]   whole life gets such a bad rap?
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:32.580]   A bunch of reasons. And number one, whole life insurance gets a bad rap because all
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.140]   life insurance agents are paid on commission and commissions are calculated based upon
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:44.140]   a percentage of what in the business we call the first year premium. So these premium rates
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:50.260]   vary across companies and across types of policies, but they'll range from anywhere
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.060]   from 50% of the first year premium to a hundred and, to over a hundred percent of the first
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.620]   year premium, depending on the product. So let's just, for sake of analysis, let's just
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.180]   say 50% makes our math simpler. If you're selling a term life insurance policy that's
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.700]   $30 a month, then your first year premium is $360. So a 50% commission rate would be
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.820]   about $175 ish. That's not bad money, but if you can take the same insurance product
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.780]   and you can change the commissions from $30 a month to $300 a month, well now you've
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.660]   just increased your commission rate to a much higher number. And I hate to do on air math
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.940]   because I always get the number wrong, but let's just say it's, I mean, you're in
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.140]   $1,750 if I'm, if I'm anywhere close on my mental math. And so there's a very large
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:44.460]   incentive for insurance agents to change from the $30 a month policy to the $300 a month
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:51.540]   policy because of the incentive for higher commissions. And unfortunately money talks
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.540]   and there have been many, many life insurance agents who have made the choice to press the
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:03.060]   product that's the higher commission product than just simply because of the fact of it
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.580]   being a commission. Now that's the first thing you got to get out there and you got
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.700]   to be aware of that. After being in the industry, I personally think there are fewer agents
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.460]   who've made that decision than I thought before being in the industry because most
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.500]   agents that I know usually they're really working hard to do what's in their client's
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.220]   best interests. But there is a very large potential conflict of interest there.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:32.300]   The second thing that's happened is due to the nature of the industry being somewhat
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.580]   siloed in the past, oftentimes the only tool that a life insurance agent had to help their
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.780]   clients with investments was a life insurance policy or an annuity. And so what happened
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:51.220]   is you would generally either be a stockbroker, in which case you didn't sell life insurance,
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.040]   or you were an insurance agent, in which case you didn't sell stocks. So there's a natural
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:02.100]   lifestyle with life insurance needs that in most, and I'm going to use as my proxy client,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.900]   I'm going to use a middle income, dual income household, middle class situation because
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.860]   planning for somebody who is in the lower economic sphere, minimum wage worker, is very
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.580]   different than planning for somebody who's a billionaire. And I'll talk about some of
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.500]   the strategies, but let's just stick with a middle income household.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.220]   There's a phase of need. And so let's say that you have a two income household, young
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.580]   families coming together. There's a need at that age for a lot of insurance because their
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.000]   need in case one of them dies is very large and they don't have a lot of money to invest.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.980]   But through the course of a career, they're going to pile up money, they're going to want
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.820]   to invest, and the need for insurance is going to decline. And so that becomes a real business
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.940]   problem for a life insurance agent. If they can't also do investments, then they have
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.220]   to say, "Well, how do I keep my client with their insurance policies for longer and how
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.540]   do I give them something to invest?" And so what happened is insurance agents would start
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.640]   to compete against stockbrokers. And this is usually the comparison that you hear in
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.200]   today's world where people talk about, "Well, you either buy stocks or you buy whole life
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.260]   insurance." That's often the comparison that's made. And I think that's an unfortunate artifact
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:12.500]   of that siloization of the industry. I think the best model personally, from my opinion,
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:18.300]   is for a good financial advisor to have access to both life insurance products and investment
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.900]   products and then to fit those products to their client situation. But there's some powerful
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.220]   conflicts of interest. And then the other thing is when you get into companies, all
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.580]   financial companies in many ways are suspect. Many insurance companies have just done some
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.820]   egregious things with their products and with their policies, just like many financial companies
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.840]   have done some egregious things to their products and to their policies. And the financial industry
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.860]   does not have a history of transparency. They don't have a history of low costs. So those
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.500]   things are changing very much because there's now a lot more transparency and that's forced
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.700]   the costs down. And this is across the board on insurance policies and on investment products.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:04.060]   There's been massive presses by the free market to expose certain things and that's caused
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.940]   the companies to change their product design. But there are a number of reasons why and
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.740]   there's some very important conflicts of interest that consumers need to be aware of so that
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.460]   they can move properly through the industry.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:23.500]   And I think you bring up great points, Josh, too, because the there are reasons why whole
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.740]   life gets a bad rap. And and for full disclosure, these things still happen, you know, even
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.980]   though because I you know, I've got clients who who specifically have these situations
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.940]   where they met with a financial planner at you know, and the financial planner title
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:45.780]   we both know can be thrown on just about anything. Anybody could call themselves that. And and
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.740]   then and people clients have this perspective of what they're going to get and they don't
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.980]   always get that. And they think, OK, well, I'm talking to a financial planner and they
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:58.700]   say they're a holistic financial planner and they give this great presentation. But at
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:05.940]   the end of the day, it ends up being one thing. And in particular, I this is why I really
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.540]   want to talk to you, too. I recently had a client who was working at the financial planner
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:16.540]   before me, and he was actually at Northwestern Mutual, and she wanted to invest and, you
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:21.340]   know, do a number of different things. And her, you know, quote, investment product is
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:29.340]   a whole life policy. And she's 30 something years old with no kids and not married and
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:36.780]   no property and anything like that. And from my perspective, I thought, wow, like, how
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.900]   did this make sense? You know, and I wanted to pick your brain. Like, what would you think
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:50.260]   about this? This seeing this from somebody else's portfolio? In my mind, it just screamed,
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.740]   you know, again, conflict of interest. And I know you don't know the full story, but
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.380]   what are your thoughts on if you see something like that? And what are your thoughts on how
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:04.300]   does how does a client like her how does she how does she even know she got the run? It's
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.460]   like, how do you even decipher? You think you're speaking to a professional financial
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:15.140]   planner and you just trust them? And how do you know? How do you kind of read between
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   the lines?
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.820]   I really that's the most difficult question that I get. And it's the reason why I created
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.400]   Radical Personal Finance. It's very hard for most consumers to know whether they're getting
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.020]   good advice or bad advice. Yeah, it's very difficult. And one of the things that I'm
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:37.740]   trying to do with with my show is to bring more light to some of the things that often
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.460]   aren't talked about. There's no way I don't believe there's any way that you or I can
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:47.540]   sit here and you may know more facts, but with just the facts that you described, it's
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:53.740]   very hard for me to know, okay, was this person given good advice or bad advice? I've been
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.980]   in situations where on a case like that, it's a natural fit. And it could be a natural fit,
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.220]   for a number of reasons. If the person, for example, has a natural or an inherent distrust
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.220]   of investing in stocks. On the surface of it, you would generally say younger person,
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.420]   little need for insurance, 30 year old, not single, you would say not so much of a need
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.580]   for death benefit. That's a mark against life insurance. You would also say long time horizon,
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.340]   assuming that they're investing for retirement. So you want as you want, you've got a long
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.820]   time horizon. So you should you should be investing in a way that's going to have the
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:33.500]   highest maximum possible return over long period. You would usually steer away in that
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.620]   situation from whole life insurance and you would steer towards a much more aggressive
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.540]   stock based portfolio. But I've also been in that situation where a client just flat
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.540]   out categorically says, I cannot stomach the thought of losing money and I cannot stomach
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.540]   the volatility of the stock market. That's very difficult because for financial advisors,
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:59.140]   oftentimes you as an advisor are very comfortable with volatility, but many people are actually
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.700]   not comfortable. And a hobby of mine is actually to look at what are the actual returns that
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.580]   people actually get in their investments. And when I was trying to figure out how do
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:13.380]   I become a skillful and useful investment portfolio manager, I went back and looked
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:19.420]   at what are the actual returns that people get. And in general, when you pull the data,
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.180]   you find that the average investor underperforms their own investments by greater than 50%.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.940]   So there are a number of false comparisons that are often made by those of us who are
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.660]   pundits on the industry where we say, well, the S&P 500, if you put your money into an
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:42.460]   S&P 500 index fund and left it alone, you would get a 10% rate of return over XYZ historical
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.780]   period. But when you look at the actual average investor, you find they've underperformed
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:53.500]   that return by greater than 50%. And one reason for that can be volatility. And so if that
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.860]   person talked through with their advisor and their advisor said, here are your options.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.460]   You could choose mutual funds and here's what we would guess with the mutual funds,
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.180]   here's the volatility that we would expect. You need to be prepared in any year for the
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.500]   value of your portfolio to decline by about 15%. Every three years, you need to be prepared
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.740]   for the value of your portfolio to decline by about 33%. And over the course of your
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.180]   investment lifetime, Miss 30-year-old, you need to be prepared for on at least two to
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:27.800]   three occasions for the value of your portfolio to decline by about 50%. Those are the realities
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.580]   of investing in the stock market. And so you've got $100,000 here in this investment account.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.900]   That means that it's very likely that you're going to open your account statements within
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.020]   the next three years and your account's going to be down to about $60,000. Are you okay
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.540]   with that? If they're okay with that, I would encourage them to be in stocks. And my job
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.100]   as a good investment advisor is to move them into stocks. Now on the flip side, if I turned
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.140]   them and they said, no, I can't handle that. I cannot do that at all. You'd have to go
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.380]   through over tax ramifications as well, which is a whole separate thing that I can share.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.140]   Then you might look at something like a life insurance policy and you might say, this policy
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.540]   is guaranteed to grow in value. Here is what we, here's historically how this policy is
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.740]   performed. Looking forward, I would guess that it would work about like this. You may
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.980]   get a rate of return that's about, depending on the policy, depending on the policy design,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.500]   4 or 5%, 6% maybe, depending on how you've structured it. What would you prefer? And
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.380]   that person may have chosen to be preferred. Now I've just sketched that out as an ideal.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.580]   They may have said, okay, let's do the life insurance policy. I've sketched that out as
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.340]   an ideal scenario. And my guess is that neither of those things happened as far as most advisors
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.060]   are not good enough to go through all the scenarios. But that would be what I would
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.260]   love to see every advisor do. Because the problem that I see, the mistake that I see
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.800]   people making is they don't clearly articulate what their goals are. Then they don't clearly
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.340]   understand the risks and the benefits. And I'm not just talking about what's the standard
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.620]   deviation of my investment portfolio. What are the risks and the benefits of any approach
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:01.940]   to investing? And then how do I make an intelligent decision within those choices? So I don't
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.740]   like the comparison of stocks versus life insurance. I own both. And I think both have
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:12.100]   a place. But they've got to have a right place in the right situation at the right time.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.140]   I don't like to see either of them vilified.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.540]   I agree. I think they both have a place. And I want to talk more about where you think,
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.140]   what your opinion is on term life versus whole life. And we kind of went through a little
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.980]   bit on life insurance as an investment. But I think they both have a place. And I think
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:34.180]   that the kind of comfort that the listeners and general public should have is that there
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:40.780]   is a place for these things. It's just a matter of, it really comes back to the investor and
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:46.900]   the client of being more clear and concise on what they need. And I think, like you said,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:52.620]   sometimes they just don't. I've had clients who are like, I hate to see my portfolio go
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.940]   up and down. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. And so what they're saying
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.660]   to me is I want a conservative portfolio. So one in particular cracks me up. She cracks
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.700]   me up. So she was in mostly fixed income. And she's an older client too, but she was
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.660]   mostly fixed income. And then we meet for her quarterly review. She's like, why isn't
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:22.100]   my portfolio going anywhere? And I said, well, remember how you said you didn't like the
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:28.460]   up and down? OK, well, maybe I need a little more risk. I said, OK. So then we add on more
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:34.020]   risk. And then she's like, wow, my portfolio just kind of seems all over the place. Fast
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.500]   forward to the next quarterly meeting. I'm like, well, remember? And it's funny because
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:45.780]   I think clients will say things and mean something else. Sometimes they're not even totally sure
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:51.140]   how they feel in theory. And I think a lot of what I do and spend time with them is helping
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.100]   them understand what's going on. I think the best way to get really comfortable with what's
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.580]   happening in your portfolio is to be educated. And hopefully you're working with a financial
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.740]   advisor or financial planner who is getting you comfortable with that and understanding,
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:09.520]   like you were saying, a $100,000 portfolio could be $60,000. But then it could also equally
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:16.660]   be $120,000. And understanding that kind of big swing. And as long as they understand
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:22.140]   that those are the outcomes, then getting them comfortable with the outcomes, then I
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.980]   feel like they have a better grip on what they're doing.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:33.140]   But I wanted to ask you about term versus whole life. So this is the big kind of crux
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:39.460]   of it, right? Let's just say somebody goes to talk to their financial planner, whatever
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:46.540]   firm they work at, and says, I need life insurance. And what kind should I get? When do you think
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.220]   that it makes sense for somebody to have whole life? And when do you think it makes sense
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.580]   for term life?
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:57.380]   If the need for insurance is temporary, you always buy term life insurance. If the need
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.140]   for insurance is permanent, you buy whole life insurance. It's that simple. There's
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.700]   really no need to, I mean, there are varieties to it, but that's what you need to recognize.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.400]   All temporary life insurance needs should be met with term. All permanent life insurance
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.460]   needs to be met with whole life insurance.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.420]   And what do you think is a permanent need for life insurance? Who's somebody who has
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.860]   a permanent need for life insurance?
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.780]   I think most people have a permanent need for life insurance, but there are some people
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:31.900]   who have more of a need than not. Tying together that question and also the previous commentary
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:38.380]   that you provided, one thing in my experience that really changed me, and I was fortunate
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.460]   because I worked with Northwestern Mutual, I had the opportunity to work with people
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:47.140]   who had been long term clients of the company. They call this just managing the company's
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.140]   clients.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.020]   And so as part of that, when I started as a financial advisor, I was 23 years old, and
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:57.620]   so naturally the natural market that I had was young people. And so I had my philosophies
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.380]   about the best way to handle money as a 23 year old or a 24 year old or a 25 year old.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.620]   And then I had the academic framework from becoming a certified financial planner or
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.120]   working through the chartered life underwriter curriculum, had the academic framework.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.860]   But when actually speaking with people who were older, and I had several clients who
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:20.700]   were in their 70s, 80s and 80s, I would discover things like a client would say, and this is
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.860]   with regard to the topic of whole life insurance, they would say, "The best financial decision
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:30.620]   I ever made was to buy a whole life insurance policy." And I would say, "Huh? That shouldn't
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.620]   be the case."
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.820]   Well, what happened is that they looked back and that actually had been their best investment,
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:41.000]   even though the academic would say, "Well, it shouldn't be," but it actually was for
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.540]   them in reality.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.880]   So the other thing I didn't understand was I had always bought into the concept of self-insuring.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.960]   I'd always understood that if I would buy term insurance and I would invest the difference
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.940]   into stocks, and so therefore because of doing that over the course of about a 20 to 30 year
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.520]   time perspective, then I would get into a situation where I would have plenty of money
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.280]   and I would no longer need life insurance. I would be self-insured. That was the concept
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.360]   that I began with.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.880]   I had an experience that really, really changed that, however. The experience was with a client,
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.720]   and this was a network client, somebody who'd had policies with the company for a very long
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.240]   time and I took over servicing their account. They were in their mid-70s. They had been
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:29.860]   very successful. The husband had been an entrepreneur, had sold a company for several million dollars.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:35.680]   They had invested the majority of that money and they'd split it between him and his wife
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   in some different trust accounts. When I met them, they had a net worth of about $2 million
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.520]   and they were living within their income, but it was starting to get tight. The reason
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.080]   it was getting tight was because the majority of their money was tied up in houses. They
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.120]   had a $600,000 house in Massachusetts and about a $450,000 house here in Florida. He
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   had exhausted his investment accounts. His wife still had her investment accounts and
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.840]   trust, but because of their age, those were primarily tilted in the direction of fixed
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.480]   income and they weren't creating a ton of income at that time. This was about three
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.080]   years ago.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.160]   She died unexpectedly. She was there at the first meeting. I met with them a couple of
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.600]   times. I was working through a comprehensive plan for them. Then all of a sudden, he called
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.360]   me and said, "My wife's in the hospital. She contracted this very strange disease and
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:26.480]   she died over the course of a couple of weeks." Here he was with a net worth of $2 million
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.560]   and he didn't have $5,000 or $10,000 in his checking account. He couldn't pay for
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:36.920]   the funeral. He had to put the funeral on to a credit card. I delivered a death benefit
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:43.120]   check of about $60,000 or $70,000 of the death benefit on her permanent life insurance policies
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.260]   that she'd had. He was so grateful to have that money because it got him through the
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.720]   period of months, allowed him to pay for the funeral and allowed him to wait until the
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.000]   house was sold, etc., before he was able to get through. That really surprised me because
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.280]   in general you would say, "Here's somebody who has $2 million of assets and no debt and
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.060]   you're telling me that they need this life insurance money." But it was a real blessing
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.520]   to them to have the life insurance money.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.760]   That caused me to filter my academic approach, which was, "Well, they should have just
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.400]   had a bigger emergency fund." Yeah, but people spend their emergency funds. It caused
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.880]   me to say, "Well, they should have maintained more liquidity. They shouldn't have had
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.320]   those two houses." But when people are involved in their houses and they've got
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.720]   their lifestyles and their country club memberships and everything set, they don't often change.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:37.360]   It really caused me to become a little bit less convinced of my academic perfection and
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.040]   a little bit more connected with real life. I think that most people would like to have
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.320]   some life insurance that continues forever.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.240]   The other experience that I had working with clients, and I'll often refer to clients
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.160]   because that's what changed me. I had my theories and then I met real life. The other
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.360]   experience that I had was I found that almost nobody ever ran out of their need for life
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.800]   insurance because instead of my approach, which was, "Well, you buy a house and then
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.600]   you pay it off and then you just get really rich." Most people buy a house, they pay
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.800]   it down, then they upgrade their house, then they buy cars, and then they put their kids
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   in college.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:19.720]   What happens is that most 50-year-olds are not measurably of a better financial situation.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.800]   They don't actually need less insurance than they did when they were in their 30s.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.000]   They actually need more often because they've increased their incomes, they've increased
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.280]   their lifestyles, and now they need to cover that.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:35.280]   I recognize that the need for insurance often doesn't go away like in my mind it should.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.240]   Then also, people don't like giving it up. When people haven't owned life insurance,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   they don't actually know the feeling of security and confidence that comes with having life
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.480]   insurance.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.560]   Once they own it for a while, usually something will happen. They'll have a close call on
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.000]   the highway or a friend of theirs will have a heart attack or something like that. Then
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.320]   all of a sudden they say, "I'm really glad to know that if something happened to
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.600]   me, I've taken care of my family."
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.480]   Once they get into that perspective, then they often look at their situation and say,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:13.000]   "I don't want to lose this." One of the big things that I have had to work through
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.440]   is a lot of clients who might be in their 50s and their 10-year term life insurance
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.400]   policy is going away and they don't want to lose their insurance coverage.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.680]   Then you're out shopping the market as a 50-year-old and saying, "What can I do
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.600]   and how can I figure out how to keep life insurance in force?" Maybe in the meantime
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   they've had some health scares.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.640]   You're watching that commercial with Alex Trebek.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.640]   Right, right.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:40.320]   Like, "Hey, that sounds like a good idea."
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.540]   I have come to prize in financial planning a concept that I almost never hear people
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:51.840]   talk about. That's the concept of flexibility. When I build an insurance plan, I want to
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:58.520]   make sure that no matter what happens, that it's going to work over the long term.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.240]   In general, you always solve death benefit needs with term life insurance because term
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.880]   insurance is going to be your cheapest way to buy death benefit. That's always going
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.800]   to be the case. Term insurance is going to be your cheapest way to buy death benefit
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   in the beginning.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.640]   But you have to recognize the fact that your insurance is going to expire. Term life insurance
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:24.880]   is temporary. It's going to expire. If you have a short-term need and you need death
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.040]   benefit, you always start with term life insurance. But you want to leave yourself some options
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.360]   as your financial life develops.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.960]   It might be the fact, it might be the case that 10 or 15 years from now, you're effectively
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.760]   self-insured. You've paid off your debt. You've saved a million dollars. You don't
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.800]   need life insurance anymore. At that point in time, you go ahead and drop it.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.120]   But it might be the case that something else has happened. You've started a new business.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.000]   I've been in this situation where I invest heavily into investments that are non-liquid.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.600]   You've bought houses. You've bought rental properties. And all of a sudden now, if you
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.880]   die, you don't have liquid assets that are sufficient to cover your family.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.080]   So you need to make sure that your term life insurance program in and of itself is flexible.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.200]   And then you need to make sure that you have options to change it from term life insurance
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.680]   to permanent life insurance as you need to.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.280]   Yeah. And I think that's a great point, too. So let's talk about that a little bit, too.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.880]   What do you say to somebody who's listening to this and thinks, Josh is brilliant and
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.240]   I love the idea of the combination and the flexibility of insurance? What do you say
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:31.520]   to someone who doesn't have the budget to do? You know, and we know this working with
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:38.640]   younger people and being in our 30s is how do you manage having that coverage, that insurance
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:44.720]   coverage and you want your cake and eat it, too. What should you do to try to fit it into
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   your budget?
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.120]   I've got on my show, I hope this whole thing doesn't sound like an ad for radical personal
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:56.880]   finance, but I've got probably at this point 12 to 18 hours of content on life insurance.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.200]   So I'm going to give the short answers. But if people really want to dig deep, there is
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.920]   some content available on life insurance. I've got, I think I did a three hour show
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.680]   on term life insurance. And I don't often like to talk about academic backgrounds, but
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.360]   in this case I'll go ahead and do it. There's a design, I do have an academic background
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.840]   in the insurance industry and that's one of the things that does make a difference when
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.320]   you study the academics of it. So for example, I have a certificate called the Chartered
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.240]   Life Underwriter, which is in many ways equivalent to a master's degree exclusive to life insurance.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.080]   If you can work with an insurance advisor who has after their name CLU, that means something
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.040]   and you should consider that person a little bit more knowledgeable than the guy next door
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.880]   on the street. But the answer is cost is not a constraint if you do the program right.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.440]   So I'm 30 years old and I have two young kids and I'm married and I am the sole income
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.960]   earner in my household. I have just under two and a half million dollars of term life
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.360]   insurance, I think it's like 2.3 million dollars of term life insurance. And my monthly
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.320]   premiums for that are something like 85 bucks a month. So it's not generally cost prohibitive
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.960]   to have term life insurance if you adjust it right. For younger people, I do not like
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:13.280]   level term life insurance. The standard advice you hear is buy 10 or 15 or 20 year level
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.200]   term life insurance. I don't like that and there are a few reasons why. In short, level
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:24.040]   term life insurance is a product that will force you out at a predetermined date, 10,
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:29.080]   15 or 20 years from now. The cheapest prices will always come in the shortest periods of
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.560]   terms. So 10 year term insurance will always be the cheapest. But the problem is it's inflexible
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.280]   and you're forced out of the policy after 10 or 15 or 20 years.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   There's another type of policy design which used to be far more popular. This is called
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.840]   annual renewable term life insurance or another name for it which is the same as yearly renewable
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.440]   term. This is not as popular today because it's hard to explain how it works to people.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.960]   So it's not easily packaged into a 30 second TV commercial. But if you talk to an insurance
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:03.240]   agent, ask them about an annual renewable term policy. That's what I own is all of
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.720]   my insurance is annual renewable term insurance. The way these policies work is they are pure
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:15.960]   term life insurance. There's no cash value accumulation. There's no savings programs
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:21.120]   to it. It's just pure term life insurance. But the way that insurance policies work internally
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.280]   is that every year the actual cost, the premium increases each year of your insurance because
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.980]   you're one year closer to your likely death. So the way these policies work is they charge
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:39.360]   you whatever the actual premium is at the current age for your situation. So I pay every
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:46.280]   year what the actual cost of insurance is for a 30 year old male. I don't pay for
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.680]   what a 40 year old male is. I pay for a 30 year old male. In the beginning of life, this
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   is the best plan for younger people, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When you get to
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.200]   about your mid 40s, that's when you need to change. At that point in time, you want
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.440]   to start looking at level term insurance products instead because the premium rates start to
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.120]   increase substantially on annual renewable term once you get into the 40s and 50s and
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.700]   60s and they're unaffordable at that point in time. So that's where your level term
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:16.200]   policies are the best bet. The reason however why, so my term insurance
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.720]   policies and my wife's policies are all a, it's a Northwestern Mutual product because
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.200]   that's where I came from. It's a product called Term Insurance to Age 80. So the way
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.160]   it works is I can keep my insurance policies as long as I want up through the age of 80.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:36.760]   So that gives me another 50 years of coverage but I pay the exact price that a 30 year old
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:43.400]   should pay. So it's very cheap now and they're convertible anytime between now and age 60
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.200]   without taking any medical exams. So my plan is to build a lot of wealth and build a lot
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.880]   of assets. I have some small whole life policies at this point in time but I expect to probably
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.400]   desire to have more whole life policies in the future. So if I sit down at age 40 and
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.560]   I got a couple million bucks and I decide I want to go ahead and purchase some more
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.240]   whole life policies, I don't have to take more medical exams. I can just swap out my
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:12.500]   term life insurance for whole life insurance. So that is my recommendation for younger people
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.640]   to what my family is doing and it's my recommendation for others to pursue. It's very hard however
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.360]   to find an insurance agent who's going to be aware of annual renewable term or yearly
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   renewable term. More and more companies are pulling their products but if you ask your
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.200]   insurance agent, there are companies out there especially included in the brokerage world
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.240]   who offer that type of product.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.960]   We are going to take a quick break in the show right now and if you are thinking about
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.480]   looking into life insurance, please check out this podcast episode sponsor, TermLifeInsurance.com.

[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:01.880]   I think you bring up a great point too Josh. It's hard to find. A lot of insurance out
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:08.560]   there is products and is for lack of a better word, cookie cutter. So clients fill out a
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.300]   drop down box and then they fit in a very specific thing and especially for the term
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:19.400]   product, there are insurance companies don't like to invest a lot of time and energy and
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.440]   resources in the term product. That's just their, you know, they want that to be the
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.160]   quickest easiest sell. They don't want to invest a lot of time and you bring up the
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.320]   point that it could be a little bit, clients can have the ability to make it a little bit
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.200]   more complex and work a little bit more in their favor and it's going to take extra time
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:43.680]   on their part, on the client's part to ask and figure it out and see if they're working
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.240]   with a company that can provide them what they want.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:52.200]   There's no reason not to work with an insurance expert. One of the things that is frustrating
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.960]   to me in some ways is the fact that all insurance, there is no, I am not aware, I actually got
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.560]   an email from a reader saying it was two companies that he thinks that they did so I need to
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.880]   check this out. I don't know the names of any companies off the top of my head that
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.280]   will sell insurance that's not commission based. All insurance products are commission
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.040]   based and the question is who's keeping the commission? So let's say for example when
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.000]   I was an insurance agent with Northwestern Mutual, I had access to Northwestern Mutual's
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.960]   products and then I could also sell insurance with any company that brokered their insurance
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.960]   which is most companies out there. So I could sell a Northwestern Mutual policy or a MetLife
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.160]   insurance policy or Prudential policy or a Banner policy or whatever and I would be paid
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:42.280]   a commission on any of those sales. That commission is exactly the same as the owner of what TermInsurance.com
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.640]   or SelectQuote or AccuQuote or any of these companies that advertise on TV, Xander Insurance
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.700]   for the Dave Ramsey crowd. All of those companies collect the exact same commission on their
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.920]   products as I would collect on the sale of it.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.840]   And so when you're thinking about the purchase of insurance, you have to say, "Well, what
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.720]   am I trying to get? What's the service that I'm trying to get?" If you work with a local
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.600]   insurance agent, if you can find somebody who's competent and who's trustworthy, even
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:16.440]   on a term life insurance sale, that can be worth it as far as from their perspective
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.600]   from a commission standpoint. If I were a commission rate on brokered insurance products
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:27.000]   like a Banner Life or Prudential or MetLife, those would range from 75 to 100% of the first
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.400]   year premium. And so as long as you're not trying to buy an $82,000 policy, in which
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.680]   case it's really not worth it. There's not enough incentive there for an insurance agent
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   to work with you.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.840]   But if you're working with a family and you're going to buy a million and your wife's going
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.640]   to buy a million or your husband's going to buy a million, you're going to wind up with
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.520]   premiums that are 100, 200 bucks a month. There's an 800 to $1,200 payday there for
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.920]   an insurance agent. And so it's worth it for an insurance agent, even on term life insurance
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:58.480]   products, to sit down and work with you and say, "Let me walk you through. Let's figure
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:04.040]   out how much insurance you actually should have and you'll get some more personalized
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.400]   advice." I think that's really valuable because all you're going to get online is a calculator
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.160]   and you're going to get a multiple of income approach or something like that. But yet you're
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.280]   going to pay exactly the cost for that versus the product from your local insurance agent.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.160]   So why not work with someone who can actually review your situation?
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:28.400]   Yeah, I think that's a great point. And to also talk about fees and things like that,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:36.320]   these are not fees that come out of the client's pocket. This is how they're compensated internally,
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:42.200]   the insurance agent. So you shouldn't have to worry about you, the insured, as paying
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:48.880]   the fees out of pocket. It comes out of the sale of the plan. It's an internal fee from
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:56.200]   the insurance provider. So like I always say, you get what you pay for. You get what you
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:01.920]   pay for in a lot of things in life and you can get what you pay for in insurance as well.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:09.880]   And if you do want that extra attention, some people, the online, the dropdown, whatever,
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:15.800]   that's fine. That works for them and that's great. But if you want that extra attention
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.040]   and extra handholding, it's out there. There are people out there and you can get it and
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:26.120]   not necessarily have to pay for it. But you do have to make sure that you understand what
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.540]   you're getting and that you're not getting more than what you need to and you are working
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.540]   with someone you trust.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:37.140]   I think the reason people don't want to work with individuals is because they're concerned
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:42.280]   about sales pressure. And many life insurance agents over the years have used high pressure
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.200]   sales tactics and this makes people feel very uncomfortable. And so they're concerned that
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.160]   if Joshua Sheets shows up in my house and he's sitting at my kitchen table, he's going
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.040]   to pull out the hammer. He's going to say, "Sign here." And all of a sudden I'm going
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.360]   to wind up buying something I didn't expect to buy. That's a reasonable, rational fear.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.800]   I have the same fear in other areas of my life and reasons why I don't want to work
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:09.560]   with a salesperson. I think that the best move is get educated so that you can ask good
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:16.000]   questions and then try to work with an agent who knows what they're talking about and even
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.720]   get a second opinion. It is a risk because many agents will use a high pressure sales
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.800]   tactic on you. But if you're educated, you can smell it out.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.040]   And again, I've done my best. I know Shannon's doing her best. We're doing our best and today
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:38.080]   it's better in 2015 than it was in 2013 for transparent sources of information to know.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.480]   Like I said, most people don't have a clue how much commissions are on insurance policies.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.120]   I've just told you normal rates, normal ranges so you can have an idea. I always wish in
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.120]   the years of it as an agent, I always wish people would ask me, "How much money do you
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.140]   make and how do you get paid?" People don't ask. And I think that ought to be clearly
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.080]   available and clearly available information. Don't be scared to ask hard questions. It's
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.560]   your money. You've got to take care of it.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.400]   Well, they think it's – those are questions you think you ask a financial advisor or financial
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.280]   planner and I think they're not necessarily common questions people think about in insurance
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.080]   sales. And like you said, there's money being paid out and people should understand
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:19.880]   where it is. But how do you advise somebody though – I mean they're doing their research,
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:26.080]   maybe they've asked around, nobody's got a good insurance person for them to work with.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.400]   How do they go about finding somebody?
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:34.960]   Another difficult question. So I've struggled with how to answer this question. I'll give
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.120]   you my answer. Feel free to disagree. But I've struggled with how to answer this question
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:45.440]   because having been in the industry, I have a soft spot, some biases having been in the
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   industry. But now that I'm external to the industry, I can see the problems and see those
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:57.160]   – see the problems. Here's my best guess. I think there's a lot of value. Personally,
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:03.000]   I am biased but I think there's a lot of value in working with somebody who is at least
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.480]   if you don't know anybody already. Let's say that you're working with your Merrill
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:11.640]   Lynch lady and she's going to say, "OK. Here, let me refer you over to my insurance
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.400]   rep." OK. That's fine because then they can service it within the office. But if you
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.800]   don't have an existing relationship, I would probably prefer to work with a mutual insurance
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.760]   company instead of a stock insurance company. There are three big ones who are – there
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.960]   are others that still exist but there are three really big ones that are the market
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.240]   leaders and those three are New York Life, Northwestern Mutual and Mass Mutual. I would
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:39.760]   check to see if any of those three companies have an office near you. Then what I would
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:45.280]   do is I would call that local office. I would ask to speak to the managing director. That's
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.400]   usually the term that will be placed on it or it could be the supervising director. The
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:55.000]   person who is in charge of that office used to be called the district agent. But now – and
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.800]   that's actually still what it's called in insurance contracts but that name has been
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:03.200]   changed on the public marketing side. I would say, "Here's my situation. I'm trying
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.080]   to find a rep, trying to find an agent. Which of your agents would you refer me to?" That
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.280]   person will choose one of their agents. I think that's about the best plan that I've
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:18.840]   got for you right now because that will allow you to work with a company that has a history
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:23.920]   in insurance. Usually, a rep from one of those companies is going to be more well-trained
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.960]   with life insurance than is say the local car insurance rep. If you actually have some
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:34.560]   friends that have taken jobs working as a life insurance rep for say the local car insurance
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.240]   company and they just have their financial services rep, the production expectation,
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.920]   the number of policies and things like that of those reps is for those of us who come
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.880]   from a life insurance background is laughably low. There's really not the incentive or
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:55.280]   the desire for many of the agents in that situation to really be experts on life insurance.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:02.200]   At least if you go with one of those companies, they're going to have access to training
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.520]   and they're probably going to be more knowledgeable. Just because they're with those companies
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.000]   doesn't necessarily mean that they're exclusively able to sell that company because that's
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.560]   the fear. The fear is, "Well, if I work with the Mass Mutual guy, then I have to
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.300]   buy Mass Mutual." Mass Mutual might be the best fit or it might not be. Northwestern
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.160]   Mutual might be the best fit or they might not be. So ask the rep, "Can you sell me
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.060]   products with other companies?" I had many clients for whom Northwestern Mutual policies
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.760]   were the best solution. I also had many clients for whom Banner life insurance policy was
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.120]   the best solution. If you're working with a rep that has access to both, then they should
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:41.000]   be able to help you out and actually give you some better, more personalized advice.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:47.800]   I actually agree with your suggestion on how to find an insurance rep that you can speak
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:53.320]   with. I think that the first choice is obviously somebody you know and trust, but if you don't
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:59.080]   have that person, the next best is that route. I would say when you do speak to that office
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:05.240]   manager, the person in charge, having come from a branch office experience, I think anybody
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:11.080]   who's at the top level of an office, they know who their people are and how they work
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:17.720]   and operate. You should have a very honest conversation with that office manager or whatever
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.840]   their call, whatever their title is, and say, "Look, I'm looking for somebody like this.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:28.280]   I don't want a hard sell. I want somebody who's going to answer my questions." Give
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:34.160]   them the full detail of who you are and what you want and they will do a really good job
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.120]   of finding the right fit for you.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:42.600]   Most people who are managers of an office like that, they have a client either, depending
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.880]   on the company. For example, my understanding, New York Life managing directors don't do
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:52.000]   any personal production. They're going to refer out all of theirs. Some Northwestern
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.160]   mutual managing directors do do some personal production. It varies depending on the company.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.880]   I don't remember what MassMutual, FS and my friends, what they do.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   Most of the time, when people are at that level, they're not going to be necessarily
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   100% focused on building new clients. They're focused on managing other agents. Some of
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.000]   them might say, "I'll help you myself," in which case, go for it. It's probably fine.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.480]   Or they'll go ahead and say, "We'll just go ahead and call. Here's the person who's
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.400]   going to be the best fit," and they'll help.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.320]   Don't be scared to call multiple offices. Just because the company name is a name that's
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.560]   respected and admired doesn't mean that the office is run by somebody that you want to
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.480]   work with. I had a great experience at Northwestern Mutual, but I've met people who said, "I
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:36.800]   had the worst experience in the world." Having been outside the industry, there are some
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:51.160]   offices that I would never work with. Just like with anything, you've got to look around.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.720]   The name helps. It's a good start, but you've still got to figure out who's actually going
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   to work with you.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:02.600]   Lapera: Yeah, definitely invest the time and you'll get what you pay for as far as what
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   you invest in.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.680]   Kline: I have some thoughts for you. Earlier, I sidestepped the question of whole life insurance
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.920]   as an investment. I have some thoughts on that topic.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:15.680]   Lapera: I actually wanted to go back there. We kind of talked about it a little bit. But
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:22.480]   yes, I did want to go back to that point of whole life as an investment option. This will
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:29.320]   come up a lot. Again, it kind of goes back to the industry. If somebody is meeting with
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:32.440]   a person who works for an insurance company, a financial planner who works for an insurance
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:40.640]   company, many times you will get a pitch, a sales pitch. You might get a great financial
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.520]   planner who will give you a very holistic approach, but I know personally I've had a
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:49.520]   number of clients get a very strong pitch on the value and benefit of life insurance
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.880]   as an investment. My clients call me and they're like, "I don't know. Maybe it sounds like
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:02.840]   a good idea. I don't really know what I was just told, and it's hard for them to decipher
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.960]   it." What is your view on whole life as an investment solution?
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:11.320]   Kline: I've got some strong thoughts on this. I'll do my best to lay them out in a way that
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:18.200]   people can understand it. I have a little dream. One of my dreams is that in the future
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:24.320]   you won't have to distinguish between, "Well, my financial planner is a financial planner
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.600]   from an insurance company," or not. Today, it is much more likely that a financial planner
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.680]   who works in an insurance company is more likely to suggest a whole life insurance policy
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.720]   than someone who doesn't. I'm not sure how much of that. I think some of that is just
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.160]   due to experience, bias, things like that. I think some of it is just due to exposure.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:50.760]   For example, if I hadn't ever worked with some of those older clients who told me, I
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.440]   would look back on their history of investing in stocks. So many people who've done everything
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:00.600]   that Money Magazine said to do, they've wound up losing money in stocks. I think more people
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.160]   lose more money in their 401(k)s than they make. There are a lot of reasons for that.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:10.320]   I think when you actually look at actual returns, what we as financial planners tell people
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:15.280]   to do doesn't work many times because they don't do it. It's not that there's anything
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.880]   wrong with the advice, it's wrong with how we articulate it, which is a whole challenging
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.680]   question of how do we as advisors do a better job for clients. But insurance has a lot of
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:30.480]   strengths and a lot of weaknesses. The first thing I would recommend to people is to pull
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.680]   away the idea of belief. Earlier I joked about it kind of being a religion. I believe in
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:43.480]   life insurance or I don't believe in life insurance. To this day, many financial planners
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.680]   would make statements like that. Well, I don't believe in whole life insurance. One of the
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.720]   things I learned and I had to go through some very painful tearing as an advisor was not
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:58.560]   to say that, but rather to say what are the attributes of any product or any choice or
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:05.760]   any decision. Let's pull it out of life insurance for example and say what about investing in
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   real estate. Somebody says, "Well, I don't believe in investing in real estate," or
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.960]   "I believe in investing in real estate." People who make those statements are probably
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.720]   not real experts in the industry. They're probably not expert real estate investors.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:24.800]   The only purpose of any investment is to create cash for you and that cash is going to have
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.840]   certain attributes, sometimes going to be cash now and sometimes going to be cash later.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:33.200]   But we're using that investment to fund our lifestyle and to fund our goals. So we can
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:39.160]   look at any financial opportunity and every financial opportunity will have strengths,
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:44.240]   it'll have weaknesses, and it'll have a place where it fits. Savings accounts have
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:50.080]   a place where they fit. I keep cash and $20 bills at home. I don't keep all my money
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.200]   in a savings account. There are reasons for that. There are risks to it. Same thing with
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:59.360]   insurance policies. Insurance policies have benefits and have advantages and disadvantages
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:02.440]   as do stocks. But even if you say something like stocks, that still doesn't tell you
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.560]   anything about the trading strategy. So every approach has benefits, has advantages and
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.120]   disadvantages. You can only ever make a good decision when you actually know what your
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.040]   goals are and then you can look and say, "Ah, here's the right move." And I like to use
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:21.760]   a couple of simple analogies for people. My favorite is the question of cars. If you go
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:27.520]   to a car dealership and you say, "Well, I'm looking at," and you're looking at two cars.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.000]   One car is a Honda Civic and the other is a big Ford F350 Dually. How do you choose
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.400]   between those two different vehicles? You only choose between them based upon what your
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:44.680]   goals are. If you walk into the car dealership and you tell the person, "I'd like to tow
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.400]   the horse trailer around as I travel across the country and show my horses off," and they
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.200]   start talking to you about the fact that the Honda Civic gets great gas mileage, you know
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.360]   you're in the wrong situation. On the same hand, if you say, "I need a commuting car,"
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.820]   and they start talking to you about the F350, you're in the wrong situation. And so most
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:06.880]   of the time what happens in bad relationships, financial planning relationships gone bad,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:13.720]   is the advisor or the salesperson hasn't effectively articulated the goals and then effectively
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:20.120]   clarified the attributes of a certain type of product. And they're not connected. That's
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:25.160]   usually where it goes bad. Not based necessarily on the actual attributes of the product, but
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.920]   actually where they're connected. Once you start with the basis of, and this is where
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.320]   I'm going to switch to a different metaphor. Once you know what I want to do, for example,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.400]   I want to dig a hole, or I want to move some things, so I need a shovel. Well, there are
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:41.720]   literally dozens of different types of shovels that you could buy. You could get a snow shovel,
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:47.280]   you could get a flat shovel, you could get a rounded shovel, you can get a garden spade.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:52.700]   There are tons of different designs of shovels. Some variations of design are very large.
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:57.560]   For example, a snow shovel versus a simple round garden spade. Big difference between
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.800]   those. You wouldn't try to dig a hole with a snow shovel, and you'd be dumb to try to
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.800]   move snow with a garden spade. But then you can even fine tune it a little bit more, and
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.960]   you can talk about slight differences of different lengths of shovels and different applications
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:14.000]   for them. So the same thing with insurance. I like to explain that to say, let's walk
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.920]   away from the emotion of a philosophy and talk about the actual attributes of the product.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.800]   Fundamentally an insurance policy can represent a couple of different things, but it represents
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:30.160]   an insurance product with certain built-in attributes. Some of those attributes are the
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:34.480]   tax code, some of the attributes are the investments that are within the policy, some of the attributes
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.760]   are actually how the internal mechanics of the policy work. So where people often go
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.400]   wrong with, the first place that they often go wrong when comparing insurance policies
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:50.640]   as an investment, is they make a poor comparison of what is their alternative. If you are trying
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:58.240]   to compare a traditional, whole life insurance policy, I'll be specific here, a traditional
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.800]   ordinary life insurance policy with an old conservative mutual insurance company, a Mass
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:09.280]   Mutual, a New York Life, a Northwestern Mutual, if you're trying to compare that with stocks,
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.520]   you're making a poor comparison. Because from the perspective of the investments that are
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:20.160]   driving that, it's like the F-350 and the Honda Civic. Fundamentally, a traditional
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.020]   ordinary, what's called a portfolio-based life insurance policy, is going to be funded
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:30.520]   based upon what in industry lingo is called the general account of the insurance company.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:37.640]   The general account is their portfolio of investments that they run, which they're using
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.280]   as reserves to pay out their policy obligations. By law, that investment portfolio is going
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:51.880]   to be extremely conservative in nature. Usually, greater than 80% of that investment portfolio
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:57.160]   is going to be invested in fixed income investments. Depending on the insurance company, depending
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:01.880]   on the cycle, they may have a portion of it which is invested in public securities, they
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.600]   may have a portion that's invested in private placements, they may have a large portion
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.000]   invested in real estate, each insurance company advantages differently. But it's a very conservative
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.420]   portfolio. So, if you're going to go back historically and say, "How do the returns
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:18.840]   over a 20 or 30 year period of my whole life insurance policy compare to the returns of
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:26.880]   my S&P 500 index fund?" In a normal market scenario, the S&P 500 index fund is always
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.880]   going to have a higher ending value than the whole life insurance policy. That's generally
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.680]   going to be true because the market is going to be delivering a higher return to pay you
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.040]   for the volatility that you have to suffer. So, I would never compare a life insurance
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.000]   policy directly against stocks, unless I'm just simply saying, "Well, here are some
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.360]   different choices." I would compare a life insurance policy against other types of investments
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.960]   that are very, very stable. So, I would compare it against putting together a portfolio of
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.560]   CDs. I would compare it against putting together a portfolio, perhaps, of corporate bonds,
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.520]   depending on the structure. That's what I would compare it against. If you compare a
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.120]   well-designed life insurance policy against those types of investments, life insurance
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.400]   has a lot more going for it. It's a much more compelling case.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.360]   There are also some disadvantages to life insurance policies. For example, you've got
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.640]   to be aware of the tax ramifications of life insurance. One of the disadvantages of life
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.080]   insurance is you cannot put it into a qualified account. You can't put it into an IRA. You
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:31.080]   can't put it into a 401(k). It has to exist as a separate external product. And so, the
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:36.320]   disadvantage with life insurance is that if you own a policy, you own it for 30 years
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:43.080]   and you cash it out, then you're going to pay tax on that money at ordinary income rates.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.960]   If I'm going to compare that, and no matter what the growth is, it's going to be paid
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.540]   at ordinary income rates. If I'm going to compare that to possibly the tax advantages
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:56.000]   of using a Roth IRA, where I can have growth after 30 years that doesn't pay any income
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.760]   taxes, or if I can compare that to a portfolio where, for example, I'm holding stocks on
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.360]   a long period of time where I can pay taxes at long-term capital gains rates, that's
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.680]   a demerit against the life insurance policy. But then you can move into some specifics
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:18.160]   of, for example, the ability to borrow money out against the policy without surrendering
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.360]   it. Now, all of a sudden, that money can come out without incurring current income taxes
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.680]   as long as the policy stays in force. Now, I've got an advantage of life insurance.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.720]   So where I think life insurance works really, really well, whole life insurance policies
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   work really, really well, is they work very well for longer-term, safer dollars. When
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.360]   I was trying to figure out how to articulate it, I was studying just some sales training
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.880]   of some life insurance agents, and that was a phrase that really made sense to me. Longer-term,
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.480]   safer dollars. So I view my life insurance policies as part of my emergency funds, part
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:57.920]   of my backups. I don't view them as a core component of my ability to really grow wealth.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.080]   They're part of my emergency funds. I actually like to keep a bulk of my emergency fund in
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:09.040]   a life insurance policy if possible, because this is money that is very, very safe. It's
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.200]   guaranteed by the insurance company to always increase in value. The rate at which it will
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:20.120]   vary from time to time. But in the case of an emergency, let's say I have a short-term
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:24.760]   car repair bill or something like that, with most life insurance companies, you can have
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.200]   the money within 24 to 48 hours. Now, that's not always the case. By law, they have up
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.760]   to six months to send you the money. But as a matter of practice, most insurance companies
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.720]   will be able to get you a check in 24 to 48 hours. So when I look at something like an
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.960]   emergency fund situation, for me personally, and I look at the fact of, okay, if I'm going
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.840]   to pretend I'm going to keep six or 12 months of living expenses on hand as cash, well,
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.200]   a certain amount of those living expenses needs to be readily available in case a hurricane
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.520]   blows through. So maybe I'm going to keep a month or two worth of living expenses in
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:05.420]   $20 and $100 bills in my gun safe, something like that. Then a certain amount of it needs
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:11.960]   to be readily available in, say, a savings account or a money market fund that's linked
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.080]   directly to my checking account. But I don't need a year's worth of cash sitting in a savings
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:21.240]   account. But I can go ahead and keep some of that cash in the context of a life insurance
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:27.760]   policy. Then if I need it out, I can go ahead and get it out in 24 to 48 hours. With that,
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.040]   that should get me through a lot of the things that would bankrupt other people. But then
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.840]   I've taken what I've done there is I've effectively taken money that's sitting in a savings account
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:42.640]   earning what, 0.0 nothing, and I've moved it into an environment where it's not earning
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.680]   10%, but maybe 4 or 5%. Who knows how long this low interest rate environment is going
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.720]   to continue. Life insurance dividend rates are on the decline right now because of the
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.200]   fixed income interest rates. But I'm earning more than I'm earning in a savings account.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:03.840]   When you also start to compound that with other benefits and you look at the tax-free
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.340]   transfer at death, there are some advanced techniques, estate tax planning techniques
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:14.640]   we can get into, and not even estate tax planning, just some advanced tax planning techniques
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.680]   even for people who aren't subject to the estate tax, which is most of us are not at
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:23.800]   this point. Now we've got an over $10 million exemption amount for everybody. It becomes
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:29.320]   a more flexible approach. In Florida, money that's in a life insurance policy is exempt
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:36.240]   from the claims of creditors. It's also a non-probate asset. So it passes by contract
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.320]   law not based on probate law. I can own the policy in a variety of flexible ways. So as
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:48.800]   a tool within my financial planning arsenal, it's useful. But it's not because it's a catch-all
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:54.000]   be-all. It's just simply useful. That's my opinion. Unfortunately, none of that stuff
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   ever comes into a 30-minute sales presentation for most people.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   No. I was going to say that's the first I've ever heard this.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.260]   Well, this is my frustration with the financial planning industry.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.220]   I've sat through a lot of those.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.060]   Not only am I against a lot of the sales of life insurance policies, I'm against a lot
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:18.400]   of the sales of mutual funds and Roth IRAs. The reason is because structurally speaking,
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.520]   our financial advisory industry is structured to sell financial products rather than structured
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.460]   to help clients reach financial goals. What I would love to see is a transition from us
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:35.480]   as financial advisors away from being paid upon the sale of financial products towards
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:41.700]   clients paying us directly for advice. Unfortunately, that's very uncommon. Most people don't pay
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.480]   for advice. They don't pay for coaching. But if they did, I'd not only sell less life insurance,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.260]   I'd sell fewer IRAs and I'd probably start a lot more businesses. I'd help people transition
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.840]   a lot more careers. There are a lot more things.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.680]   So that's why, I mean, there's a reason why I have 12 hours of content on life insurance.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.440]   I haven't even gotten to universal life insurance, which is going to require its own 12 hours.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.800]   I haven't even gotten into variable products. I just have term life insurance and whole
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.900]   life insurance because this is always the challenge. As a tool, there's nothing wrong
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:17.880]   with the tool, but poorly applied or misapplied, it can be a disaster or it can be really,
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   really great.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:26.600]   You're right. Well, first of all, I've never heard it, life insurance, whole life insurance
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:32.320]   as an investment discussed in the manner that you just did. I've heard a lot of whole life
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:38.880]   pitches having been a financial advisor. But you bring up the great point of everything.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.440]   This is why I left a large wealth management firm to start my own company because no matter
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:49.600]   what they tell you, there is always going to be a bias. And it is very difficult to
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:55.360]   sift through that as an individual working within a large organization. But that's why
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.680]   people listen to podcasts and read blogs and try to find the best information out there
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:06.800]   to help them navigate. And I agree with you. I think there is a place for whole life and
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.640]   it's just as an investment, even it's just a matter of understanding where and how it
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.200]   fits in your total mix of your life goals.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.040]   Two of the pieces of data that when I was trying to first get my hands around it, that
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.520]   really convinced me that I didn't know what I was talking about when I just said,
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.880]   "Well, whole life insurance is a bad investment. Don't you know that?" is number one, when
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:37.440]   I learned about the concept of what's called bank-owned life insurance. And there are two
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.800]   in the industry they call these BOLI, which is B-O-L-I, bank-owned life insurance. And
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.920]   the other one is COLI, which is C-O-L-I, which stands for corporate-owned life insurance.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.000]   And one of the things that I didn't understand is that many large banks keep a substantial
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.480]   amount of assets within the context of life insurance policies. And they can use that,
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.880]   they can keep that there because it still counts according to the federal guidelines
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.160]   on banking as part of their capital reserves. And so they're able to take some of their
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.880]   money and tuck it into a life insurance policy and it can be very, very useful for them and
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.360]   they can earn a higher rate on it than they can with just simply money sitting in a less
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.120]   productive financial product.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.520]   Large corporations often also will use life insurance for various purposes, including
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:33.480]   funding their pension plans for their key employees and for their executives. When I
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.320]   learned about that, I said, "Wait a second. Maybe my view on this is a little bit too
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.960]   simplistic." Unfortunately, the average consumer is not going to be able to access
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.200]   the information that they need in order to make a good situation. Because even though
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.000]   I just went through that whole long speech on, you know, variety is a whole life insurance,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:58.120]   whole life insurance policy from New York Life or Mass Mutual or Northwestern Mutual
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:07.040]   is nothing like a whole life insurance policy from Prudential or from Transamerica. They're
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.480]   just night and day different focuses because just because you have the life insurance contract,
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.760]   that doesn't mean that the actual underlying contract is well built. You have to look at
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:23.520]   the expenses of the contract. You have to look at the actual company's mortality experience.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.280]   You have to look at the dividend rates that they're paying and how those dividends are
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.760]   structured. It's a very involved situation, which is why most financial advisors and financial
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.600]   planners who look at it say, "Don't buy whole life insurance. Buy term life insurance
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.120]   and invest the difference." That's what's so frustrating about it. It's really one of
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.960]   those things where you need to be an expert in it and you need to be very knowledgeable
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:51.040]   in it. Most people aren't going to put in the time or energy needed to develop their
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.800]   expertise, but those who do, do very well in the insurance industry.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.800]   If my listeners want to get more in-depth knowledge, how do they find you?
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.480]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com if they're on a computer. The best way to listen to Radical
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.200]   Personal Finance should be in most of the podcast directories or just search your app
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.560]   store on your phone. Just search Radical Personal Finance. You can go back through and see a
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.840]   lot of past show titles. I think I've got them properly tagged. I'm behind on all my
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.960]   tagging and what not on the computer. If you go on the website on RadicalPersonalFinance.com
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.280]   and search, just check the tag for life insurance or click one of the drop down menus on the
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.400]   top where how the content is organized and go to life insurance. You'll see a number
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.200]   of shows that I've put there. They're pretty hardcore. Don't expect them to be short sound
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:48.640]   bites. They're the hardcore master's degree level information on insurance. I'm hoping
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.800]   to simplify this over time and create more consumer friendly products and pieces of content
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.120]   that will be helpful. But for now, that's the best way to find out more.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.800]   Good stuff. I'll have links to all these in my podcast notes on Financially Blonde. I
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.160]   feel like we could talk about this and clearly you have, but we could talk about this for
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:15.880]   hours. Let's wrap it up here and get to some random three questions for you.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   I'm ready.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.640]   Okay. We've been talking about insurance as an investment and investments in general.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.720]   So your first question is, what's the best investment you think you've ever made?
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.820]   Best investment I've ever made is in my own income and in my own business. Most people
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.000]   do not want to get rich and they don't want to retire, but they do want to be financially
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.400]   independent and the primary place that you should focus is on your personal income and
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.320]   on building your own business because for a variety of reasons, that will give you the
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:52.120]   fastest path to that return. And focusing on your own income is the most controllable
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.860]   option and that is what makes the difference. I've never met anybody who got rich by investing
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:02.320]   in their 401k or their IRA or by buying life insurance. I've always met people who were
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:08.100]   rich either because they made a high income or because they had a business who built some
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:15.120]   additional wealth by investing in their 401k or in a life insurance contract. But you've
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.120]   got to focus first on building a massive income. Your goal should be 10 years from now to increase
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:25.240]   your income by a factor of 10 and that's very, very doable or to build your own business
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.960]   if you are entrepreneurially minded.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.400]   I'm with you. I said to people when I started my own company, I'm like, "That's where I'm
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.040]   investing my capital because I think I'm the best bet out there."
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:42.340]   So I'd invest in me all day long. Good stuff. Okay, question number two. If you could only
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:48.140]   have one book with you on a deserted island, what book would it be and why?
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:55.500]   I'll have to tilt this in the context of a finance book.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.660]   Oh, no. I want to hear.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:03.260]   The problem is I hate the answer. Christians are the worst and I'm a Christian because
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:09.560]   the answer to that question is a Bible and that sounds really, really horrifyingly trite
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:15.660]   to many people. The reason is because it's the book that never ends as far as when you
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.640]   start to see how it works. I mean, there's a reason why I don't know how many millions
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.780]   of pages have been written about it. So that is the most versatile book that I would go
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.980]   to but most people when they hear an answer like that, they just say, "Oh, that's ridiculous."
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   Like, "That's too easy."
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.180]   If it's a book in general, I would say the Bible, which is a total of 66 books, so you'd
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:39.940]   have to narrow it down. And the reason is simply it's a book that never gets old and
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:46.100]   that when you talk about the wisdom of the universe, the deeper you go, the deeper it
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:51.540]   goes. So I don't know if that's an annoying answer for you. If so, I can give you a finance
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.540]   book.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.780]   No, I personally love that answer and your reason why, but let's just say for people
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:04.780]   who found that annoying or tried, what would be your other option?
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:11.900]   So let me look at my bookshelf here. I was a part of that also. I was stalling to try
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.660]   to come up with my answer to the question.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:20.700]   I actually asked you this because I just wanted to give you some more time to stall. I recently
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:25.500]   put on my blog, I had just a fun post this week about things about me and I answered
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:31.100]   this question myself. And now this will make me seem really vapid, but my answer was Pride
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.100]   and Prejudice.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:37.300]   It's a beautiful book. I don't think there's anything vapid about Pride and Prejudice.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:44.360]   Cosmo magazine maybe, but Pride and Prejudice is, how does it start? There's a commonly
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:51.100]   held belief that any eligible man with an income, I don't know, you could probably quote
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.980]   it better than I can, must be looking for a wife. It's a beautiful book.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:02.980]   My favorite finance book that I would, I am actually working on a book right now and what
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:09.260]   I'm trying to do is to build it to be the actionable book that is to be the book that's
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:14.860]   everything that you can do, that you can actually do with money. But in the meantime, I would
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:22.420]   say just a great financial book to recommend to people. These questions catch me so flat
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.780]   footed. A good financial book would be something like Richest Man in Babylon. If you haven't
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.820]   read a book like Richest Man in Babylon, I'd encourage you to do that. I don't really read
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:37.440]   many novels these days. If I do, it's dystopian fiction or techno military thrillers, things
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.660]   like that. But a good finance book would be Richest Man in Babylon, which might be something
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:44.460]   that I would enjoy reading again.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.460]   Okay, good stuff.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.460]   But if I were on a desert island, I wouldn't, here's what it would be. On a desert island,
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.220]   I would take the Encyclopedia of Country Living or I would take a book like that that's very,
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220]   very practical.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.220]   Oh yeah, no, no. We're not going practical.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.220]   Turn my desert island into an oasis.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:05.820]   We're not going practical. I know, and I'm Irish, so I mean, I'd be sunburn reading Pride
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:11.220]   and Prejudice on the beach. It wouldn't be good, but we're not talking practical. It's
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:17.460]   not reality. All right, your last question. When you relax, what do you do?
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.860]   Relax? What's that?
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:25.300]   I know. Married, two kids, business. Yeah, I know it doesn't happen often. So when it
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.820]   does, what do you do?
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:32.660]   I would say if I'm really relaxing, I'll probably watch YouTube videos. That's probably the
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:41.100]   go to. I read a lot, and so that is a primary go to is various reading projects. But if
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:45.740]   I'm really just need to turn my brain off, I'll watch YouTube videos. I have a soft spot
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:52.480]   for overlanding videos, which is a whole subset of four wheel drive people who take their
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.700]   car and basically drive it around the world where the journey is the goal, not just getting
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:03.060]   to the destination. And so I'll go, and my wife and I are watching a wonderful series
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:09.420]   that is on YouTube right now called Expeditions Overland. And there's a group of young filmmakers
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:13.140]   who've put together their vehicles, and they've done various adventures in the US and then
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:18.820]   up to Alaska and then down to Panama. So that's our thing recently as we've been watching
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:23.220]   each week as their new episode comes out on YouTube. It definitely would encourage people
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:26.180]   that. It's really beautiful. Just look on YouTube called Expedition Overland.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:31.520]   All right, good stuff. Joshua Sheets, Radical Personal Finance, thank you so much for joining
