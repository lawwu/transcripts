[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   - What did you mean when you said that the skull
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.520]   is a poor adaptation and a titanium plate will be better?
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.700]   And in particular, what does that mean in reference
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.320]   to things like traumatic brain injury?
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.480]   I mean, are human beings unnecessarily vulnerable
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.040]   at the level of traumatic brain injury
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.780]   because our skulls are just not hard enough?
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.060]   - You know, maybe I'm being too harsh about skull.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840]   The skull is very good at what it does,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.720]   given the tools that we are working with
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.920]   as biological organisms that develop in our mother's uterus.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   The skull is, you know, usually the appropriate size.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.120]   It's one of the hardest things in your body.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   That said, there are a couple of puzzling vulnerabilities.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.440]   Some of the thinnest bone in the skull
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   is in the temporal region.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400]   This is, you know, neurosurgeons will all know
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.960]   that I'm heading toward a feature
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.480]   that sometimes darkly is called God's little joke,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   where the very thin bone of the temporal part of the skull
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.400]   has one of the largest arteries
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.160]   that goes to the lining of the brain
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.320]   right attached to the inside of it.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.000]   And so this bone just to the side of your eye
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.040]   tends to fracture if you're struck there.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.080]   And the sharp edges of that fractured bone
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680]   very often cut an artery called the middle meningeal artery
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.920]   that leads to a big blood clot that crushes the brain.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.320]   That's how a lot of people with, you know,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.560]   otherwise would be a relatively minor injury end up dying,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.120]   is this large blood clot developing
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.320]   from high pressured arterial blood that crushes the brain.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.000]   And so why would you put the artery
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.840]   right on the inside of the very thin bone
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.440]   that's most likely to fracture?
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.480]   It's an enduring mystery,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   but this is probably the most obvious failure mode
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.360]   in the design of a human skull.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.160]   Otherwise, you know, in terms of general impact resistance,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.760]   I think the brain is a very hard thing to protect.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.720]   And the architecture of human anatomy
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.160]   probably given all other possible architectures
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.280]   that can arise from development, it's not that bad really.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   One of the interesting features in terms of shock absorption
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.920]   that hopefully prevents a lot of traumatic brain injury
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   is the fluid sheath around the brain.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   The brain you may know is, it's mostly fat.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.040]   It floats in saltwater in our brains.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.280]   Our brains are all floating in saltwater.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.480]   And so with rapid acceleration, deceleration,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.480]   that sheath of saltwater adds a marvelous protective cushion
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.840]   against development of, you know, bruising of the brain,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.920]   say, or bleeding in the brain.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.800]   And so I think for any flaws in the design that do exist,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240]   you can imagine things being a lot worse,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.800]   and there's probably a lot fewer TBIs than would exist
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.400]   if a human designer was taking a first crack at it.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   As you describe the thinness of this temporal bone
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.800]   and the presence of a critical artery just beneath it,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.120]   I'm thinking about most helmets.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.880]   And here, I also wanna cue up the fact that,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.040]   well, whenever we hear about TBI or CTE or brain injury,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.440]   people always think football, hockey,
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   but most traumatic brain injuries
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.040]   are things like car accidents or construction work.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   It's not football and hockey.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.480]   For some reason, football and hockey and boxing
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.480]   get all the attention.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.720]   But my colleagues that work on traumatic brain injury
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.080]   tell me that most of the traumatic brain injury they see
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.640]   is somebody slips at a party and hits their head
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.560]   or was in a car accident
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   or environmental accidents of various kinds.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.560]   To my mind, most helmets don't actually cover this region
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.720]   close to the eyes.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.240]   So is there also a failure of helmet engineering
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.280]   that I can understand why you'd wanna have
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.600]   your peripheral vision out the sides of your eyes,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.760]   periphery of your eyes,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.880]   but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.040]   why isn't it being better protected?
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.520]   - You know, I'm no expert in helmets,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   but I don't think we see a lot of epidural hematomas
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.120]   in sports injuries.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.200]   To get this kind of injury,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.600]   you usually need a really focal blunt trauma,
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.400]   like the baseball bat to the head
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.080]   is a classic mechanism of injury
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.040]   that would lead to a temporal bone fracture
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.280]   and epidural hematoma.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.080]   With sports injuries, you know, you don't often see that,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.080]   especially in football with a sharper object
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.560]   coming in contact with the head.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   It's usually another helmet, right,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.080]   is the mechanism of injury.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   So I can't think off the top of my head
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.440]   of an instance of this exact injury type in sports.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.760]   - You spent a lot of time poking around in brains of humans.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   And while I realize this is not your area of expertise,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.960]   you are somebody who I am aware, you know,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   cares about his health and the health of your family.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   And I think generally people's health.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.800]   When you look out on the landscape of things
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.840]   that people can do and shouldn't do,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.520]   if their desire is to keep their brain healthy,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   do any data or any particular practices come to mind?
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.640]   I mean, I think we've all heard the obvious one,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.160]   don't get a head injury.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.920]   If you do get a head injury, make sure it gets treated
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.800]   and don't get a second head injury.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.360]   But those are sort of duh type answers
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.520]   that I'm able to give.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.560]   So I'm curious about the answers
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.280]   that perhaps I'm not able to give.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.320]   - Yeah, well, you know, the obvious ones,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.360]   it's one that you talk about a lot.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.040]   And I see a lot of the smoldering wreckage of humanity,
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.680]   you know, in the operating room and in the emergency room
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   for people that come in.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.000]   You know, I work my practices in San Francisco
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.200]   right next to the Tenderloin.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.280]   And so a lot of people that end up coming in
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.840]   from the Tenderloin have been drinking
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.360]   just spectacular amounts of alcohol for a long time.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.360]   And their brains are, you know, very often on the scans,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.280]   they look like small walnuts inside their empty skull.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.360]   There's so much atrophy that happens
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.120]   with an alcohol soaked brain chronically
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.600]   that I would say that's, you know, far and away
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.200]   the most common source of brain damage
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.960]   that many of us just volunteer for.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.920]   And it's, you know, when you look at the morbidity,
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.240]   kind of the human harm in aggregate that's done,
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.040]   it's mystifying that it's not something
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.160]   that we are all paranoid about.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.960]   - People will think that I don't drink at all.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.240]   I'll occasionally have a drink.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.320]   I could take it or leave it, frankly.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.640]   If all the alcohol on the planet disappeared,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.600]   I wouldn't notice, but I do occasionally have a drink,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.840]   maybe one per year or something like that.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.280]   But I am shocked at this current state of affairs
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.960]   around alcohol consumption and advertising, et cetera.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.120]   When I look at the data, mainly out of the UK Brain Bank,
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.240]   which basically shows that for every drink
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.760]   that one has on a regular basis,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.080]   when you go from zero to one drink per week,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.240]   there's more brain atrophy,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.880]   thinning of the gray matter cortex.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.920]   You go from one to two, more thinning.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.080]   You go from two to three,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.240]   and there's a near linear relationship
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.680]   between the amount that people are drinking
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.440]   and the amount of brain atrophy.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.280]   And to me, it's just sort of obvious
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.560]   from these large-scale studies that, as you point out,
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.320]   alcohol atrophies the brain, it kills neurons.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.640]   And I don't have any bias against alcohol
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.720]   or people that drink, I know many of them,
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.000]   but it does seem to me kind of shocking
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.440]   that we're talking about the resveratrol and red wine,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.400]   which is at infinitesimally small amounts.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.320]   It's not even clear resveratrol is good for us anyway,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.120]   by the way, a matter of debate, I should point out.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.640]   But so alcohol, certainly alcohol in excess
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.280]   is bad for the brain.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.920]   - Sure.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   - In terms of, okay, so we have head hits,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.200]   bad, alcohol, bad.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.440]   You're working, as you mentioned, you're the tenderloin.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.240]   Is there any awareness that amphetamine use
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.280]   can disrupt brain structure or function?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.160]   - You know, that's not an area
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.280]   that I've spent a lot of time researching in.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.240]   I, you know, I incidentally take care of people
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.520]   that have used every substance known to man
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.680]   in quantities that are, you know, spectacular,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.080]   but I haven't specifically done research in that area.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.880]   I'm not super well-versed on the literature.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.320]   - I ask in part because maybe you know a colleague
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   or will come across a colleague who's working on this.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.600]   There's just such a incredible increase
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.640]   in the use of things like Adderall, Ritalin,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.200]   modafinil, R-modafinil, which I think in small amounts
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.000]   in clinically prescribed situations can be very beneficial,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.800]   but let's be honest,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.280]   many people are using these on a chronic basis.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.600]   I don't think we really know what it does to the brain,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.440]   aside from increasing addiction for those substances.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.400]   That's very clear.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.720]   - Well, for better or worse,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.040]   we're generating a massive dataset right now.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.960]   - Well put.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.120]   I'd like to briefly go back to our earlier discussion
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.520]   about neuroplasticity.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.120]   You made an interesting statement,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.440]   which is that we are not aware of any single brain area
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.400]   that one can stimulate in order to invoke plasticity,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.240]   this malleability of neural architecture.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.680]   Years ago, Mike Merzenich and colleagues at UCSF
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.760]   did some experiments where they stimulate nucleus basalis
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.600]   and paired that stimulation with a eight kilohertz tone,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.560]   or in some cases,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.160]   they could also stimulate a different brain area,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.720]   the ventral tegmental area,
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.640]   which causes release of dopamine and pair it with a tone.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.880]   And it seemed in every one of these cases,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.260]   they observed massive plasticity.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.000]   Now I look at those data
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.080]   and I compare them to the kind of classic data.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   I think it was Carl Ashley that did these experiments
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.920]   where they would take animals
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.400]   and they'd scoop out a little bit of cortex,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.560]   put the animal back into a learning environment,
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.800]   and the animal would do pretty well, if not perfectly.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.560]   So they'd scoop out a different region of cortex
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.400]   and a different animal.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.560]   And by the end of maybe three, four years
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.480]   of these kinds of lesion experiments,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.080]   they referred to the equal potential of the cortex,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.340]   meaning they concluded that it didn't matter
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.480]   which piece of the cortex you took out,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.720]   that there was no one critical area.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.280]   So on the one hand, you've got these experiments that say,
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.640]   you know, you don't really need a lot of the brain.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.920]   And every once in a while,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.600]   a new story will come out where a person will go in
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.320]   for a brain scan for some other reason or an experiment,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.080]   and the person seems perfectly normal,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.040]   and they're like missing half their cortex.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.080]   And then on the other hand, you have these experiments
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.400]   like the stimulation of basalis or VTA,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.560]   where you get massive plasticity
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   from stimulation of one area.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.880]   I've never been able to reconcile
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.800]   these kinds of discrepant findings.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   And so I'd really like just your opinion on this.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.280]   What is it about the brain as an organ
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.460]   that lets it be both so critical
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.640]   at the level of individual neurons and circuits,
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.040]   so, so critical, and yet at the same time,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.200]   it's able to circumvent these,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.680]   what would otherwise seem like massive lesions
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   and holes in itself?
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.320]   - Yeah, I mean, a lot of it,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.240]   to reconcile those experiments,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.080]   you first account for the fact
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.120]   that they're probably in different species, right?
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.000]   You take out a particular portion of a pig or a rabbit brain,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.360]   a small amount, you might not see a difference,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.480]   but a small portion of a human brain,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.640]   say the part most interested in coordinating speech
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.040]   or finger movement,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.480]   and you're gonna see profound losses or visual cortex, right?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.800]   Take out a small portion of V1
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.900]   and you'll have a visual deficit.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.440]   And so species matters.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.040]   Age matters.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.360]   If you take out half of the brain in a very young baby,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.180]   that baby has a reasonable chance
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.840]   of developing a high degree of function
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.880]   by having the remaining half subsume
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.120]   some of the functions lost on the other side,
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.840]   because they're very, very young
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.280]   and their brain is still developing.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.000]   It's to some degree a blank slate
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.360]   with extremely high plasticity over many years.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.680]   So that can overcome a lot of deficits.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.280]   Taking an adult animal's brain
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.440]   that isn't very well differentiated functionally
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.640]   to begin with, you might not see those deficits.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.560]   So apparently there's a lot of redundancy as well, right?
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.200]   There's a lot of say cerebellar and spinal circuits
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.960]   in other animals that generate stereotyped behavior patterns
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.300]   and might not need the brain at all
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.540]   to perform say a walking movement
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.360]   or some other sequences of motor activities.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.760]   So a lot of that depends on the experimental setup.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.160]   I would say in general,
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.780]   adult humans are very vulnerable
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.240]   to losing small parts of their brains
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.880]   and losing discrete functions.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.020]   (upbeat music)
