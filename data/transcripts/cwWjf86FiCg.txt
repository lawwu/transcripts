[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Hello, everyone. This is Tony speaking to you from November as I edit this episode for
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.540]   the podcast with a brief programming note before we start. Due to studio schedules,
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.360]   this episode had to be recorded way back in October, back when it was widely reported
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.800]   that a major ethical dilemma was looming for pro-life Christians related to COVID vaccines
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.240]   made from aborted tissue cell lines. But as the weeks passed, however, vaccines rose to
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.800]   the forefront that do not pose this ethical dilemma, particularly those from Pfizer and
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480]   Moderna. All that to say, today's question needs to be addressed, even if it's looking
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.120]   now like it will thankfully not be as major of a dilemma with the COVID vaccines in the
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.400]   news. Alas, on to today's episode.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.600]   Well the pandemic has disrupted our lives in America for nearly a year now, and I know
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.800]   this disruption is very real for many of you around the world too. As we record this, vaccinations
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.800]   are on the minds of as an important step really in ending the pandemic and returning to some
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.440]   sense of normalcy. But with it arrive many emails about the ethics of vaccines, questions
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   from listeners like Callum, Benjamin, Anna, Heather, Megan, Michelle, Krista, Tanisha,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.760]   Matt, Carolyn, Candace, Daniel, James, and Franco, just to name a few. Basically, these
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.000]   listeners share one single dilemma. Several frontrunners for the new coronavirus vaccine
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.920]   are made from the cells of aborted children, healthy children who were murdered. Most notably,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.520]   this includes the human fetal kidney cell line called HEC-293 from the kidney of a healthy
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   girl aborted in 1972 and Per-C6 from the retina of a healthy boy aborted in 1985. Science
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.160]   magazine reported last fall that five of the leading coronavirus vaccines use one of these
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.920]   two human fetal cell lines. And apparently, similar cell lines have been used since the
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.040]   1960s to manufacture vaccines against rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, shingles, hemophilia,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.120]   rheumatoid arthritis, and cystic fibrosis. As we record this, ethically derived coronavirus
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.880]   vaccines are in process but are slower and will likely be more expensive, rarer, and
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.960]   maybe even more difficult to get. That's the prediction, at least. So the question
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.400]   is, should committed pro-lifers get the fast, available, cheap vaccines made from aborted
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.200]   cells or should they wait? Pastor John, how do you think through this ethical dilemma?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   Let me make four kinds of observations and hope and pray that these will give some guidance
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.000]   to our thinking and our feeling and our acting, and I think all three of those really matter,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.320]   particularly in regard to the use of human organs or human tissue harvested from the
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.680]   killing of unborn children. And we need to say it with words like that, otherwise we
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.040]   will conceal from ourselves what's happening. So first observation. In Romans 3.8, some
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.620]   of Paul's adversaries accused him of "doing evil that good may come." Paul responded
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.640]   to this that it was a slanderous charge. In other words, he distanced himself from that
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.720]   kind of ethical stance, and I think we should too. We shouldn't do evil that good may
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.300]   come. God alone has the infinite wisdom to manage an entire world of sin in which he
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.400]   can turn horrible things for wise and good purposes. He never tells us that we have such
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.300]   wisdom. We don't. We are to live our lives guided by the principles he reveals in his
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:18.740]   Word, not by our calculations about how much evil we can join in for some greater good.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:27.720]   So if we really believe that the killing of unborn children is abhorrent to God and falls
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.980]   into the category of the shedding of innocent blood for which God's judgment fell, we
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:43.200]   should not think of turning this wickedness into a wonder drug to save our lives. We should
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.160]   not do evil that good may come. That's my first observation.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.500]   Second, God frequently in the Bible calls us to do things and avoid things which are
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:04.680]   very costly to us personally in order to demonstrate that Christ and his ways are more precious
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:15.280]   to us than safety or security or comfort and that we sacrifice in order to do what's right.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.920]   When we are told not to return evil for evil or that we should love our enemies or turn
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:31.000]   the other cheek or go the extra mile or do good to those who hate us, all of those kinds
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.280]   of commands are designed to show that we are not in bondage to this world and that the
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:50.880]   deepest contentment of our lives does not flow from needing to avoid risk or show vengeance.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:59.200]   By denying ourselves comfort or satisfaction or safety for the sake of testifying to Christ's
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   value to us and testifying to the sanctity of another person's life or testifying to
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.680]   our hope for another person's well-being or testifying to our confidence in God's
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:22.880]   reward beyond the grave, when we deny ourselves in that way, we aim to exalt Christ and his
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.000]   ways over mere self-preservation.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.120]   So if a scientist avoids using tissue and organs harvested from babies killed in abortion,
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.560]   or if an ordinary citizen avoids using a medication which they know has been developed specifically
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.800]   through such harvesting and research, the aim is that the Christian conscience is preserved
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:58.400]   and Christ is made much of as more valuable than any security or safety or health we might
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.160]   get through sin.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:09.720]   Third, avoiding such research and avoiding the use of the products of such research is
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.600]   only one way of testifying to the truth and value of Christ and the sanctity of the unborn
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:25.280]   persons, but another way that should be added is the proactive engagement in whatever way
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   we can to speak and act against the taking of innocent human life in the womb and the
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.400]   use of those children for research and experimentation.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.740]   So I'm saying renunciation, that is the avoidance part of our ethics, which is being
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.040]   asked about, to avoid the medication.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.720]   The renunciation of the use of such drugs has value, yes, it does, and supplementing
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:02.680]   that value should also be the proactive engagement of resisting and discouraging abortion and
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.720]   the use of aborted babies in research.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.760]   And the final observation, the fourth one that I would make, is the one that's most
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.080]   difficult to articulate but may be the most important.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.600]   The observation is that acting on principle, in this case the principle that we do not
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:33.000]   want to be complicit in the desecration of dismembered human beings, acting on principle
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.120]   often does not look like the most obvious way to be a blessing to the greatest number
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.340]   of people.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:47.580]   For example, if you try to act on the principle of not participating in the desecration of
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.560]   these children by avoiding medicines developed from their dead bodies, someone will say,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:01.140]   but look, look at all the good that is coming through the medication.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:07.000]   And they will say that they can't see the good that may be coming from your principled
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.600]   action.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.360]   So what I'm saying here is this.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:19.660]   God has ways of honoring and blessing and multiplying the effectiveness of principled
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:26.480]   action in his name, which to the human calculation may appear futile.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.940]   This is certainly the case with many martyrdoms in history, for example, or other kinds of
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:39.240]   sacrificial principled actions, which didn't look like they were going to have any payoff
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:45.380]   at all for the suffering person or for their family or for the cause of Christ.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.120]   Just a dead-end street at the stake of suffering.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.880]   The sufferers simply acted because their consciences wouldn't let them do otherwise, while the
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.820]   world sees that as futile and foolish.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:07.840]   Just save yourself and your family and others and stop denying yourself the privilege of
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.660]   life or health or prosperity.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.880]   And my point, again, is God is God.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:22.020]   He honors integrity and principled action that is rooted in his truth and his beauty
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.140]   and his worth, even where the world cannot see the point.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:34.260]   We have no idea what explosive effects in the depths of God's providence and purposes
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.380]   our principled action might unleash by God's grace.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:49.300]   So I'm saying let's not act as researchers or as ordinary consumers in a way that desecrates
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:57.260]   the bodies of unborn victims and treats those children as though they can be killed and
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.460]   their tissue harvested for our benefit.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.460]   Amen.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.460]   That's a sobering word.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.780]   And thanks to everyone who sent this question in to us.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.100]   We really appreciate it.

[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   the podcast.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.100]   Well, we have been talking a lot about providence of late, but why?
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.300]   What's the big deal about God's providence?
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.060]   What are the implications of the doctrine for my busy life?
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.700]   We're going to spend some time looking at the implications of providence, and we'll
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.540]   begin doing this next time on Wednesday.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.540]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.260]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260]   [End]
