[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:19.540]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue,
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.000]   where we take questions straight from you, the viewers.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.040]   Email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.400]   Thanks to the live viewers, as always, on YouTube.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.840]   We had to change our time.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.680]   We used to do it at, what, 11 in the morning?
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.520]   Eastern time, now we're doing it at 1.30.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.720]   The only reason we changed is 'cause Duncan is such a diva
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.960]   and he made me change the time.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.160]   I didn't want to.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880]   It just worked out easier for everyone's schedule.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200]   This was, it made things easier,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.960]   so thanks for sticking with us.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.720]   Duncan, one of the themes I've been writing about
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.140]   on my blog for years now,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.600]   I think 2014 was the first post I did in this.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.680]   I've been writing my blog since 2013.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.640]   I think I'm coming up with my 10-year anniversary here.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.880]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.960]   Is the fact that market cycles are getting faster.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.240]   There's a number of reasons for this.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.560]   The markets are more mature, they're more global in nature.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.160]   Technology makes things more efficient.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.480]   The free flow of information
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.140]   just makes things travel faster and move faster.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.280]   And we also have central banks
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120]   that just have their tentacles just into the market now
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.000]   and it's hard to get them out of there.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.400]   I think 2008 got this started
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.420]   and 2020 made this a permanent feature, potentially.
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.520]   I actually listened to Jay Powell's press conference
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520]   yesterday, the Fed chairman.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.180]   - Every bit of it?
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.660]   - I listened to all the questions.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.700]   It's a little dry, but for people like me, I didn't mind.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.460]   And he basically took a soft landing off the table
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.700]   and he said, "Listen, we're going to
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.540]   "tighten financial conditions to the point of
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.480]   "basically a recession, but if we go into a recession,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.320]   "don't worry, we'll be there to save the day
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.160]   "on the other side."
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.980]   And I think this massaging of cycles at the extremes
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.620]   to we're gonna provide tons of ammo when things are bad
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.300]   and then we're gonna slam on the brakes
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.620]   and pull the parking brake when things get
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.680]   on the other side and things get really good,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.820]   I think that's just gonna continue
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940]   to potentially speed up cycles, right?
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.380]   So we're gonna go from a recession in 2020 to a boom,
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.580]   to a recession, to potentially another boom, who knows?
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.420]   And I mean, it feels like we've had 11 cycles
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.320]   in the last three years.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.740]   We started out with like 1918 because of pandemic
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860]   and then we had like 1929 'cause we felt like
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.060]   we were in a depression for two months
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.120]   and then we had the roaring 20s,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.660]   which lasted for like a month.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.420]   We had the 1999 cycle in 2020 and 2021.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.660]   I guess the last year has been like the 70s kind of,
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.060]   and now it's gonna be like the early 80s,
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.740]   which is the last time the Fed threw us into recession.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.620]   And I think the fact that these faster cycles,
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.180]   I think it makes it harder for investors
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.100]   to have a long-term mindset
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.460]   because you're constantly thinking like,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.620]   "I should be doing something.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.680]   "I should be hedging, I should be making changes.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.880]   "I should be going all in, no wait,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.740]   "I should be going all out."
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.460]   All these things where I think it makes it harder
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.180]   for investors to just stick to a long-term plan
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.420]   because these cycles feel like they're moving faster.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.180]   In the past, you had these cycles that would take
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.260]   24, 18, 36 months.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.460]   It would be a long-term cycle.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.940]   Now cycles last like three to six months
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.180]   and then they're over.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.320]   And I think it's not gonna be easy,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.020]   but I think the solution to faster cycles
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.460]   is like slower decision-making process.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.300]   And I think people need to actually slow themselves down
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.560]   when they're making a decision
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.540]   and not try to make it so haphazardly.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.180]   But I think everything with the market structure
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.000]   and the way things are moving,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.340]   and I'm not trying to blame everything on the Fed here,
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.420]   but that's part of it,
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.020]   is just that I think it's harder for people to slow down
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.700]   and pump the brakes on their own decision-making process
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.880]   and be like, "Everything's moving faster.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.180]   "I should probably be slowing down."
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.260]   And that's hard to do these days.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.080]   - Do you think, would it have a meaningful impact
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.580]   if everyone just kind of unionized and said,
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.740]   "We're not gonna pay more than $12 for a Chipotle burrito"?
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.060]   Would that have an impact on inflation?
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.420]   - Is that before or after the guac?
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.380]   Because that's a big, maybe guac should just be free.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.940]   - You know what, that's with guac.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.300]   It's with guac. - Right.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.020]   All right, we're blaming it all on Chipotle?
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.060]   All right, I don't know if that's gonna happen.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.420]   All right, I still think it's a good deal.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.260]   - No, it's ridiculous.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.640]   It's ridiculously priced.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.940]   But also, yeah, I mean, the serious part of that question
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.520]   is like, yeah, it seems like people just aren't willing to,
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.660]   and myself included, to adjust
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.200]   when we see the writing on the wall.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.020]   It's kind of like it has to happen.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.060]   It has to be like a big moment.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.680]   - The other thing is, for your portfolio,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.140]   you should be building in this stuff
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.540]   that things are gonna be cyclical,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.000]   there's gonna be good times, there's gonna be bad times.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.780]   I think that's the hard thing for people to do
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.700]   is just to realize that you shouldn't try
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   to optimize your strategy for every single market cycle,
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.780]   and I'm gonna have this kind of portfolio for this cycle,
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.320]   and this portfolio for this cycle.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.740]   You should think more of having a portfolio
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.480]   that's durable enough to handle all these cycles,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.120]   as opposed to trying to make changes all the time,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   because half the time you make changes
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.420]   that leave you flat-footed,
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.300]   and then when you have the pivot and you miss it,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.120]   then you think, oh, crap, my portfolio looks great
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.040]   for what would happen six months ago.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.760]   And then you're kinda screwed.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.600]   - Yeah. - All right.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.020]   Let's do a question.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.900]   - Okay, up first we have a question from Ben.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.640]   How should your asset allocation strategy
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.940]   change with your net worth?
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.300]   For example, should someone of the same age
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.840]   with $10 million in net worth have the same allocation
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.240]   as someone with one million?
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.080]   - All right, is this a not to brag?
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.200]   Does this guy have $10 million?
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.600]   This is not me, by the way.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.040]   - Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.240]   - So the bulk of my career before coming to Ritholtz
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.600]   was spent in the institutional space.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.220]   That's like foundations, endowments, nonprofits,
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.080]   and these huge pools of capital
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.840]   like to call themselves sophisticated, right?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   Because they had a lot of money.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.180]   They had hundreds of millions
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.880]   or maybe billions of dollars in some cases.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.720]   And don't get me wrong,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.480]   some of these funds are very sophisticated.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.920]   They have these huge teams,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.600]   and some of the teams would focus on hedge funds
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.840]   and private equity and venture capital,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.400]   and they were very good at this.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.220]   But far too many of these funds
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.640]   managed money with the assumption
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.680]   that the financial markets present a complex solution
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.520]   or complex problem,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.500]   and we have to present a complex solution.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.600]   And I think people with more money
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.860]   sometimes assume that just has to be the case, right?
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.920]   I have more money.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.760]   And what I came to realize after a while was
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.360]   it's just a few more zeros.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.420]   Like managing a pool of capital that's a billion dollars,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.380]   sure, it's a lot of money,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.080]   but I don't think just because you have more money
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.120]   means you have to all of a sudden complicate things.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.220]   There's this old saying that you don't go to church
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.120]   to learn the 11th commandment, right?
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.160]   It's like you shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.240]   just because things are bigger.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.160]   So I think regardless of your net worth,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.960]   the things that matter most when creating an investment plan
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.900]   are your risk profile.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.120]   So that's your willingness, need, and ability to take risk.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.960]   I've talked about this before.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.340]   Your time horizon,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.380]   when are you actually gonna have to spend the money,
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.300]   your current circumstances, where you are financially,
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.900]   and then your goals, where you're going to be.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.660]   Those things are the only thing that's gonna matter.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.380]   So for a big pool of capital
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.660]   that's hundreds of millions or billions of dollars,
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.060]   you still have to match up your portfolio
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.420]   with your risk profile and time horizon,
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.060]   understand how much are we spending?
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.940]   When are we gonna spend it?
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.180]   What kind of risk tolerance do we have?
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.100]   That's the kind of thing.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.580]   And so I think that's the main building block,
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.600]   whether you're managing $10,000 for yourself
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.060]   or $10 million.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.300]   Now, if you do have a high net worth
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.660]   and you are one of these not to brag people
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.160]   and you're in a good position,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.000]   it can kind of change.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.100]   The risk profile thing is kind of,
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.540]   it's kind of murky because let's say you're lucky enough
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.060]   to have a high net worth and then millions of dollars,
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.160]   right?
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.780]   Your ability to take risk is high
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.620]   'cause you have a lot of money.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.860]   And if your spending level is reasonable,
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.700]   then you have the ability to take more risk
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.340]   'cause you have a higher net worth.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.940]   But you don't have the need to take more risk
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.260]   'cause you already have money, right?
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.100]   And so you're kind of balancing between
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.660]   I wanna continue to grow my wealth,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.960]   but I don't wanna screw things up.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.900]   So then it comes down to your willingness to take risk.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.220]   Okay, I have a lot of money.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.540]   Do I want to though?
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.500]   What's my risk appetite?
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.380]   What's my tolerance for risk?
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.980]   How comfortable am I with keeping things the way they are?
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.820]   How much do I wanna build
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.400]   for the next generation or whatever it is?
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.340]   So my favorite example of this
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.780]   is there's two wealthy billionaire families
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.740]   in the Grand Rapids area.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.260]   One of them I used to work for.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.020]   And there was two founders,
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.940]   two guys that founded the Amway Corporation.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.780]   And the story goes that one of them
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.820]   took his billions of dollars
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.140]   and put it on private equity and venture capital
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.200]   and all these different kinds of high-risk,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.280]   potentially high-reward funds and just invested it all
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.120]   because I have an infinite time horizon.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.960]   I have billions of dollars.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.780]   It doesn't matter.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.300]   And the other guy took his billions of dollars
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.020]   and invested it all in US government treasury bonds
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.480]   and said, "I'm gonna keep it ultra safe.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.320]   "I have this money.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.440]   "What's the point?"
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.600]   And the thing is, neither of them are right
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.720]   and neither of them are wrong, right?
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.680]   If you have that much money,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.080]   obviously that's an extreme example,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.920]   but that's the idea here.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.480]   If you get to a certain point.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.440]   The other part of the question here is basically
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.940]   when should you actually change your asset allocation, right?
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.660]   So I think that kind of gets down to it.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.700]   Like, is net worth a part of it?
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.620]   I think that's part of it is like
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.460]   when your circumstances change.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.220]   So spending, this person in the question
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.660]   already also mentioned spending.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.620]   I think spending is a big thing.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.420]   If something in your life happens that makes you change,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.740]   that's when you can kind of change your asset allocation.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.100]   I think when the market opportunity set changes,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.620]   that's time for it to potentially think about it.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.420]   So in years past, I mentioned we've had all these cycles.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.780]   When interest rates were on the floor
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.420]   at 50 basis points or whatever,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.200]   I think a lot of people were thinking,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.740]   why would I have a 60/40 portfolio
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.860]   if bonds aren't paying me anything?
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.060]   I'm gonna go to 70/30 or 80/20.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.880]   And I think that made sense
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.300]   because the market was kind of dictating that.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.140]   If you would be willing to take that risk,
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.580]   again, that gets into the willingness.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.100]   Now that rates are higher,
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.300]   maybe people who were 70/30 or 80/20 could go,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.100]   well, geez, interest rates are 5%.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.740]   Maybe I'm more comfortable taking on 60/40
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.460]   or 50/50 portfolio because rates are so much higher.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.780]   And so I think when market opportunity set changes,
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.580]   that can come to your thought process.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.140]   And I think when you pick the wrong portfolio
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.020]   in the first place,
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.100]   I think when you set an asset allocation
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.660]   and you tell yourself, listen, I can do this.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.220]   These are all the people who told us in 2020
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.100]   that I can invest in three times levered NASDAQ funds.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.460]   Don't worry, I'm young.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.440]   I have a tolerance for it.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.280]   I can handle it.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.360]   That's easy to tell yourself when markets are going up.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.460]   Then when markets are going down
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.620]   and your portfolio is crashing,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.700]   maybe you realize, okay,
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.620]   I did not understand what risk really was.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.700]   I think I got out over my skis.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.140]   Is that the right phrase?
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.420]   I never know if that's the right one or not.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.500]   - Yeah, I think out over skis is right there.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.900]   - Okay, I haven't skied since college.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.020]   I skied back in the day, though.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.660]   But I think if you pick that wrong portfolio
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.940]   in the first place and you realize,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.660]   listen, I did a portfolio that's 90% stocks.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.740]   I cannot handle this.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.620]   I understand in a bear market, it's not me.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.860]   I need to dial it down,
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.340]   even if that means lower my expected return.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.180]   So that's kind of the idea
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.980]   when you should change your asset allocation.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.000]   So should you automatically have a different portfolio
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.260]   just because you have a higher net worth?
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.500]   I don't think that's really the case.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.340]   I still think that simple is always gonna beat complex
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.900]   for the majority of people.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.520]   But obviously, if you're in that place,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.340]   then it's a different line of decisions that you're making.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.380]   And frankly, I think it makes more sense
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.740]   to simplify when you have that much money
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.140]   because the rest of your life is so much more complicated.
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.620]   Your financial planning stuff, your taxes,
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.620]   your estate planning, inheritance,
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.580]   all that stuff you're setting up,
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.740]   financial planning is way more complicated.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.580]   That's when it makes sense
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.220]   to not go complicated on the investments
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.780]   and it makes sense to simplify.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.940]   - Yeah, I think this bear market has taught me
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.500]   that my risk tolerance isn't as high as I thought it was.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.340]   - And sometimes you have to experience it.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.860]   - Now it's kind of too late.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.060]   - Well, you're still a young guy though.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.820]   I think that sometimes you have to learn that.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.140]   You're paying your tuition, right?
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.980]   So you learn that now,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.300]   and then the next time this happens,
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.020]   you right-size your portfolio to not take on as much risk
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.120]   or not take as many risky.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.140]   Were you investing in oat milk?
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.940]   Maybe next time you invest in almond milk, right?
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.940]   - Exactly, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.540]   Maybe not so much triple-levered stuff, you know?
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.380]   - That's the thing.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.700]   But that's the thing, it hurts sometimes,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.260]   but then now you know, right?
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.420]   That it's okay.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.180]   And I think that your risk tolerance
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.700]   for this kind of stuff can change too.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.700]   Like when you get more money,
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.260]   you could have a 20% downturn in your portfolio.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.100]   If you have it at $10,000,
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.960]   it's gonna be a small amount of dollars.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.700]   But if you know you have $100,000 or a million dollars
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.140]   and you have that same 20% loss,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.120]   and you say, "Oh my gosh, that's $200,000 now."
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.180]   I think even seeing that,
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.020]   some people don't live their life in percentage,
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.240]   they live them in dollar terms.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.420]   So even that could change the way that you view risk.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.140]   So I think it's okay for your risk to change over time.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.620]   You just have to understand
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.120]   that it's probably going to happen.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.060]   - Yeah, I got way too comfortable
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.820]   with the buy the dip thing working every time, you know?
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.000]   It did for a while, and then it didn't.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.860]   - Have a little more patience.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.500]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.460]   - All right, up next we have,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.720]   "I get that nominal yields are significantly higher today
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.000]   "than a year or two ago on fixed income,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.540]   "but why is nobody talking about the fact
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.400]   "that the real return of bonds is actually worse
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.580]   "than it was before all of these rate hikes started?"
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.880]   - This is true.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.020]   Also, do you notice that, I think in the social media age,
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.060]   a lot of people love to talk about things
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.980]   that no one's talking about, right?
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.820]   - Right, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.840]   - Why is no one talking about this thing
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.520]   that I'm talking about?
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.020]   Nominal yields are much higher,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.380]   but they're still well below the level of inflation.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.100]   So John, do a chart on my first one here.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.060]   This is one of my favorite charts
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.860]   that just shows the US inflation rate
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.340]   with a 10-year treasury.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.420]   It's like an alligator mouth at the end opening up.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.300]   Inflation is still above 8%,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.880]   bond rates are like 4%.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.040]   We've never seen inflation this much higher
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.100]   over the bond yields, going back to 1960 at least.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.220]   It's way higher.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.140]   So yields have come up substantially,
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.580]   nowhere close to the inflation rate quite yet.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.500]   So yes, on a real basis, you're still losing.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.340]   John, throw the next chart up here.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.900]   So this is from J.P. Morgan,
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.820]   and this shows real interest rates
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.660]   on the 10-year treasury.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.420]   As you can see, this is just subtracting inflation.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.980]   You can see, actually, in the '70s,
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.660]   even though nominal rates were 10, 12, 15%
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.100]   by the early 1980s,
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.460]   real rates were actually negative
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.980]   because inflation was higher than those.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.380]   So back in the '70s, even though they had high nominal rates,
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.540]   inflation was above that,
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.340]   so real rates were negative.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.180]   And this is the first time.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.020]   We had negative rates a little bit in 2012,
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.620]   and they've been touching the negative.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.460]   So I don't know.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.180]   The thing is, I think people only really care
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.660]   about inflation-adjusted returns when inflation is high.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.220]   No one talks about inflation-adjusted returns
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.260]   when it's low, right?
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.540]   No one was taking the 2% inflation rate
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.300]   for all the 2010s and going,
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.740]   "Look it, on an inflation-adjusted basis,
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.940]   "bond yields are actually negative."
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.780]   No one does.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.860]   You only do that when inflation is high.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.540]   That's one thing.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.100]   The other thing I think you would hope for
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.140]   is that if you're locking in these 5% yields on bonds,
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.260]   that inflation is going to fall eventually.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.740]   That's kind of the thing, right?
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.220]   We're gonna talk about IBONs in a minute here
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.780]   and how those rates have fallen,
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.420]   but I think that's part of it,
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.860]   is just these nominal yields you can lock in
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.420]   for one, three, five years or whatever into the future,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.340]   and we're not sure that inflation is going
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.140]   to continue to be 8% per year going out that far.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.140]   So if you're locking in the bond yields now,
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.380]   going out in time a little bit,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.700]   then hopefully your real returns are gonna be better
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.500]   if and when inflation finally falls.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.260]   And Jerome Powell, he said he's gonna throw us
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.540]   into a recession to bring inflation down,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.380]   so I'm bound to believe him at this point.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.460]   - Yeah, I feel like we should trust him.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.460]   He seems to be making good on his words.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.500]   Didn't you write something recently
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   where you were saying he's basically telling us
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.940]   all of this stuff like he,
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.900]   it's not like we have to read the tea leaves,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.580]   he's literally saying this is what I'm doing.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.420]   - Yeah, back in the day, you kind of had to,
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.620]   the Fed was very mysterious in what they would say,
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.220]   and you'd try to, oh, they changed two words here.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.340]   Jerome Powell's basically telling you,
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.420]   hey, idiots, I'm sending us into a recession.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.860]   There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.940]   It's happening, unfortunately.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.940]   - Right, yeah.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.820]   - Too bad, all right, next one.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.700]   - Shout out J Powell.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.220]   Okay, question three.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.620]   I've heard you both mention the pitfalls
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.060]   of working with Treasury Direct for IBON purchases,
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.980]   and I think you might actually be underselling it.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.140]   Treasury Direct is terrible in many respects
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.940]   when it comes to funding your purchases
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.420]   and customer service.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.020]   I fear actually having to redeem my IBON someday.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.120]   Yes, the current yield beats other options,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.900]   but to what degree should listeners factor
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.900]   in the time and effort of having to deal
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.060]   with a terrible broker for these investments?
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.020]   You know what comes to mind here?
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.380]   If I was like a Wall Street person,
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.940]   I would say there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.400]   - All right, that's true.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.700]   Or a good government website, how about?
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.540]   This is true.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.500]   We here at Portfolio Rescue,
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.140]   we're fans of the Sears iSavings bonds.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.900]   We've been talking about them for a while.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.320]   And I love this question because there's plenty of talk
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.160]   about risk tolerance.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.440]   We talked about that already on this show,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.940]   but there's little talk about your talents
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.500]   for complexity as an investor.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.860]   So there's a lot that goes into the portfolio
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.900]   management process where you're talking
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.260]   about asset allocation today, which is a biggie,
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.220]   but how about like your time allocation?
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.900]   How much time and effort are you willing to dedicate
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.820]   to put into your portfolio
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.980]   in these disinvestment strategies?
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.500]   So one of the reasons that I wasn't a huge fan
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.100]   of the more complex approach in the institutional world
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.940]   is because it was so operational and efficient, right?
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.940]   So you had all these paperwork.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.320]   Anytime we had a private equity or hedge fund come in,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.380]   you'd get a 200 page deck
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.220]   of this private placement memorandum
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.340]   that was all just legalese speech from lawyers
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.540]   that they would just use to cover their ass
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.340]   and fine print, and it was 200 pages worth.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.460]   And it was like, yeah, you just read it.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.740]   Don't worry, it's fine.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.580]   There was tons of due diligence in the process.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.020]   There's all these different accounts you had to open.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.740]   You had to track some of these investment strategies
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.140]   were hard to track, and the performance was hard to know.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.460]   There's often like constrained liquidity.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.660]   There's capital calls and distribution.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.780]   It's a lot of work.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.060]   And that was my biggest problem with it
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.260]   is that unless you have a huge team
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.420]   that's really well-versed in this, it's not that easy.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.940]   And so, and then after you do all the heavy lifting,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.800]   the majority of these funds still end up underperforming.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.740]   So then you have to ask yourself,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.340]   like all that hard work, was it really worth it
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.580]   if we're still doing worse
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.520]   than just putting it in the Vanguard fund?
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.840]   So yes, that stuff is intellectually stimulating,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.780]   but is it worth for the high fees
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.120]   and high probability of underperforming
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.760]   if you're not able to get in like those top decile of funds?
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.540]   Now, buying Series I Savings Bond,
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.020]   not exactly the same thing,
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.080]   but we know it's not an easy process.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.660]   They finally did update their website,
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.300]   it looks like from like 1997.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.140]   I think they're probably more like 2006 now.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.380]   So they're getting there, but they're still way behind.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.920]   I opened up an account for my daughter when she was born,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.940]   and I had an aunt who said,
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.980]   "I'm gonna give you $50 a year,
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.220]   "and I want you to open up a Savings Bond account for her
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.060]   "and put it in there."
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.260]   And so we did it for the first couple of years,
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.100]   and I think we forgot it.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.620]   Maybe the aunt forgot to give us 50 bucks,
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.480]   and we did it like two or three times.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.320]   And I wanted to go back and see like,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.940]   "Oh, that's right, the rates are higher."
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.180]   So last year I tried to check,
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.440]   and I've done this a few times where I go in,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.820]   and of course I don't know my account number
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.620]   'cause she was born in 2014,
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.340]   and forgot my password.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.420]   So I tried to enter it in a few times,
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.420]   and you lock out of your account.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.100]   So what do you do?
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.940]   Call the 1-800 number.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.460]   I called the 1-800 number, and it's like eight hour wait.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.300]   - You never wanna do that.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.720]   - So there's no customer service there.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.000]   And so I do think you have to figure out also
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.360]   how much bang for your buck you're getting.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.120]   So last week we told you here
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   that the rates are gonna fall
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.480]   because they based the rates on six months of inflation.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.920]   Right, so John, pull up the little CNBC article here.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.200]   So the new rate is 6.89%.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.800]   That was over 9%, you know,
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.160]   if you would've put it in a week ago.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.760]   So that's still pretty good,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.360]   but again, you have a $10,000 limit per individual.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.080]   So that's like $690 a year you're making on these, right?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.000]   You can get 30-day T-bills yielding almost 5% today,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.400]   and they have no limit on them.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.640]   You don't have to deal with this crappy Treasury Direct
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.760]   if you just buy a T-bill ETF, right?
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.240]   You can do it free.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.440]   Is the extra $190 a year really worth it?
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.220]   For some people it is for the time and effort,
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.280]   but some people, you know,
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.780]   there's other people who do the constant switch
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.800]   from online savings account to online savings account, right?
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.440]   Because one of them yields 25 basis points more.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.840]   You have to open all the accounts.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.460]   You have to change your bank account.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.200]   You have to change the accounts that are linked to it
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.060]   if you wanna send money out.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.960]   It's like, is that really gonna matter in the long run?
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.800]   I don't know.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.400]   Ramit at iWillTeachYouToBeRich
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.320]   talks about the difference between $3 questions
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.840]   and $30,000 questions.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.660]   And the $3 question is like the latte thing,
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.920]   you know, the Susie Orman,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.800]   is giving up on lattes really gonna have
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.040]   that material of difference to your finances?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.860]   Of course not.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.480]   But getting a raise or figuring out your housing situation
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.080]   and not overpaying or your transportation
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.840]   and making sure you're not overpaying on those things,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.940]   those can lead to huge outcomes over the long term.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.340]   I guess this one is more like a $300 question
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.760]   than a $3 or a $30,000.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.040]   For some people, that $10,000 is a lot of money
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.760]   relative to the size of their net worth.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.720]   And in that instance, maybe $200 a year extra
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.120]   is worth it for you.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.400]   But for other people, it might be relatively
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.480]   a small piece of their portfolio.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.300]   And is it really worth it?
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.080]   And I agree, if you have like a problem
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.640]   with drawing your money and you need to get it,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.480]   'cause I know a lot of people are using these
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.780]   as like a substitute for savings, like a savings account.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.080]   And there's the penalty if you pull it early.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.840]   And there's also like, what if you have a problem
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.660]   and can't get someone on the phone and you need this money?
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.320]   So, I'm still a big fan of the savings bonds,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.840]   but I agree that maybe the complexity of it
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.200]   and the fact that it's kind of a pain in the butt,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.360]   for some people, is just not worth the extra yield.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.520]   And it's just easier to take an online savings account
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.140]   where you're getting 3% and call it a day.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.240]   - Yeah, that's what I was actually thinking recently.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.400]   I was talking to Sean about this,
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.320]   is why someone now would do short-term treasury ETF
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.760]   or whatever, you know, something,
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.280]   as opposed to maybe getting 30 or 40 basis points less,
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.540]   but it being a savings account, high yield savings account.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.100]   That's what I was trying to figure out recently.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.940]   - Right, which one is going to be easier for you?
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.100]   I have an online savings account.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.740]   I could be earning 1% more if I moved it over
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.020]   to a brokerage account and put it in treasuries.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.700]   I've had the savings account for like five years
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.340]   and I honestly just don't wanna do it.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.980]   I know that seems dumb, but like, it's just, it's easier.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.200]   I have automatic contributions going in.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.900]   I can pull the money easy, it's there the next day.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.420]   It's just a little easier.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.940]   And if I'm missing out on a few basis points of yield,
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.460]   I'm okay with that.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.180]   - Right, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.960]   - I think Marcus is still below 3%.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.500]   - Yeah. - They're gonna raise rates
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.520]   for me in like eight weeks
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.020]   after the Fed just raised yesterday.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.860]   Can't wait.
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.260]   - I think they raised yesterday actually,
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.220]   but yeah, I can't remember exactly what they went to.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.060]   - That's possible.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.420]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.300]   - Okay, up next we have,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.460]   I'm trying to help my girlfriend
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.820]   with her retirement planning.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.340]   She had a bunch of 401ks with small amounts in them,
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.860]   so she rolled them over to an IRA to consolidate.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.100]   She's 39 years old,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.300]   and only has about $40,000 saved for retirement.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.060]   I had her start a Roth IRA
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.520]   as well as a regular brokerage account.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.620]   She's a travel nurse, and while she makes good money,
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.920]   she doesn't currently have a 401k option,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.620]   so is seemingly maxed out at contributing $6,000
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.360]   to an IRA each year,
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.260]   though she did max out her IBONs this year.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.420]   What would be the best way for her
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.920]   to catch up on her retirement savings?
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.760]   - Okay, so Jeremy's girlfriend
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.960]   thought the complexity was worth it here.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.780]   She maxed out her IBON.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.020]   Kudos to him, first of all,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.540]   for having this conversation with his girlfriend.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.980]   I'm guessing that that's not always easy.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.420]   It's not always a conversation people wanna have.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   This also gets to my point
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.620]   of why they should have 401k limits.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.700]   Go to people with IRAs
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.260]   if they don't have access to a 401k.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.540]   I don't think you should be penalized
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.400]   if your workplace employer doesn't have a 401k.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.740]   You should get that limit on your IRA
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.220]   if you don't have the access to 401k.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.260]   Let's make that one happen if someone's listening.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.100]   - That makes sense.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.140]   - So this is more of a financial planning question
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:03.980]   than an investment question,
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.460]   'cause I think the savings piece is more important here.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.100]   So let's bring on financial advisor extraordinaire,
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.740]   Blair Dukanay, to help out with this one.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.540]   Blair, so we're trying to play catch up here.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.860]   And the good thing is, I think even at 39,
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.020]   you still have a lot of time to catch up.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.480]   There's still plenty of time to do it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.260]   You might just have to increase
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.820]   that savings yield a little bit.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.500]   What do you think, taking away the 401k and stuff,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.580]   how can you play catch up,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.060]   if you're starting a little later here?
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.860]   - Yeah, well, my first takeaway here
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.580]   is that I've been married for 10 years,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.700]   and it sounds like the dating process has changed a lot
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.260]   if we're having these kinds of conversations.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.660]   But kudos to you for helping your girlfriend out here.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.620]   - I'm not gonna lie, I had these conversations
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.240]   with my wife before we were married too, so.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.120]   - Oh, okay.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.180]   - How romantic. - Sorry about that.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.220]   - What a catch, huh?
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:04.140]   - But I have a question here for Jeremy,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.020]   which is, is she being paid
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.900]   as a 1099 employee traveling nurse,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.180]   or is she getting a W-2?
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.340]   And that makes a big difference,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.540]   because there may be an opportunity here
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.020]   to defer more income through either--
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.420]   - Oh, solo 401k?
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.560]   - Yeah, solo 401k or a SEP IRA is even easier.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   You can max out potentially up to $61,000 in 2022.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.220]   You have to make four times that
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.500]   in order to get to that max,
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.020]   but it's essentially 25% of your net pay there
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.180]   if you're self-employed to a SEP or a solo 401k.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.580]   So that would be the first question I have.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.220]   You've already maxed out the savings bonds, which is great.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.820]   I personally gave up on that website
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.620]   and never opened my account.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.620]   I was one of those.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.300]   If she's eligible or has an HSA healthcare option,
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.540]   that's another $36.50 a year that you can defer.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.140]   And remember that health savings accounts,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.780]   HSAs are triple tax free.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.980]   They go in and you get a tax deduction.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.100]   They grow tax deferred.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.140]   And if you use them for medical expenses,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.980]   they're never taxed.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.940]   So that's another option.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.920]   At the end of the day though,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.340]   there's nothing wrong with saving
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.980]   in an after-tax brokerage account.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.780]   So she can open an account in her name,
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.420]   set up a monthly savings amount to go in
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.500]   and automatically invest.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.980]   You're not getting the tax deferral,
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.820]   but at the end of the day, when she retires,
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.720]   she won't be taxed to take money out of a brokerage account.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.660]   So it's not a bad idea to start building that bucket as well.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.500]   - Right.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.340]   And there's easy ways to do that now
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.540]   where you can automate it, automate the contributions,
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.100]   get some tax loss harvesting if it's a robo-advisor.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.860]   And I think my biggest thing was,
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.860]   if I'm explaining this to my girlfriend,
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.820]   saving is the most important thing
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.780]   you're playing catch up, right?
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.980]   The investment options are gonna matter eventually
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.860]   if you want to compound.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.420]   But I think the biggest thing is just
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.620]   to increase that savings rate
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.380]   and make sure you're stocking money away,
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.300]   especially in like the first 10 years or so.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.280]   The amount that you save is gonna dwarf
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.040]   any amount of investment returns you're gonna have.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.820]   So I would think just figure out
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.120]   what the savings rate is gonna be.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.440]   And again, make sure you're putting that on autopilot
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.300]   and making contributions automatic.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.160]   - But don't make them cut out their lattes
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.120]   because then they'll just end up hating you.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.240]   - It's true.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.120]   - Only if you do it every single day
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.280]   and invest that money immediately for the next 45 years
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.120]   at 8.5%, then you might be saving a million dollars.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.360]   I honestly don't think that kind of decision is worth it.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.500]   No person ever does.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.820]   If you cut back on something, no one ever does it.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.660]   You know how I'm gonna retire?
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.480]   - Forever.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.100]   - I'm not gonna pay for the Twitter blue check mark.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.740]   That's how I'm gonna retire.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.740]   $8 a month. - Every single month, $8.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.300]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.000]   - Okay, last but not least.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.940]   This is a long one, so hang in there.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.420]   I have an account with Fidelity
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.940]   and use their retirement planning tool,
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.900]   which is Monte Carlo analysis-based
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.460]   to see how my portfolio might look moving forward
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.300]   using different asset mixes.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.820]   What surprises me is that having a small bond position
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.220]   has always been the highest returning asset mix.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.700]   I'm retired but live off of dividends and interest,
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.620]   no Social Security or pension,
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.020]   so I'm not spending down my portfolio.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.800]   The only thing I can figure is that bonds protect
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.740]   on equity declines more than they hurt on equity rises,
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.360]   and that rebalancing during declines
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.720]   gives you a more positive bump
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.260]   than rebalancing hurts when equities are high.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.100]   I will be taking Social Security at 70,
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.340]   and the tool does require me to take RMDs
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.820]   at the appropriate age.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.900]   My best result, I define it as the portfolio
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.340]   that has the highest remaining value after 40 years.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.260]   Can you explain why a small bond exposure
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.840]   results in higher return when using Monte Carlo analysis?
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.780]   - All right, Duncan's looking for an explanation
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.620]   of Monte Carlo here.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.100]   I don't know the exact reason an all-stock one
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.940]   wouldn't perform.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.300]   My guess is because if you're spending down
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.860]   that portfolio, the bonds help a little bit,
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.780]   and if you're an all-stock and you happen to spend
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.420]   on your portfolio and you get a bear market
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.380]   at the beginning, it could lead to lower outcomes.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.140]   Blair, pretty much all financial advisors
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.540]   who use software to create financial plans,
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.140]   for their clients, utilize some sort
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.520]   of Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.580]   How do you explain this type of scenario analysis
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.140]   to clients, and then how do you think people
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.800]   should view when thinking through the scenarios here?
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.600]   - Sure, so this is more of a complex planning tool,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.140]   and we're not talking about a casino
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.860]   in the Mediterranean here with Monte Carlo analysis,
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.940]   but whenever you're building a financial planning
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.780]   projection, you have to make some assumptions.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.460]   You make some assumptions on what asset class
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.200]   returns would be, what the volatility
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.060]   of those asset classes will be,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.220]   and then you run what's called a straight line scenario,
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.500]   which is not realistic.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.980]   So let's say, for example, you estimate
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.000]   that your portfolio is gonna earn 7% a year on average.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.820]   The straight line scenario shows you earning
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.660]   literally 7% a year forever,
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.100]   which, of course, is not realistic.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.180]   So then we throw in a calculator called the Monte Carlo.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.620]   Some will run 250 different scenarios.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.520]   1,000, I think, is the minimum you would need
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.340]   to have a robust analysis, but essentially,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.780]   they're taking those assumptions.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.860]   So if you have an assumption for stocks
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.820]   with their return and their volatility,
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.440]   and with bonds for their return and their volatility,
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.020]   obviously, stocks are more volatile than bonds,
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.500]   and the math changes when you start taking money
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.820]   out of your portfolio versus when you're adding money
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.660]   to your portfolio.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.360]   So if you think about the dispersion of returns,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.540]   even though taking more risk in an all-stock portfolio
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.700]   can have a higher expected return,
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.700]   it also widens the dispersion of potential outcomes,
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.120]   and the other thing we don't know,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.300]   and the whole reason we're running
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.620]   this complicated Monte Carlo scenario
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.860]   is because we're trying to figure out
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.540]   what is a range of possibilities.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.060]   We don't know when the bear markets
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.540]   are gonna come in your lifetime.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.420]   There's something called sequence of return risk,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.660]   which is if the bear markets happen very early
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.940]   when you start to draw money out of your portfolio.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.540]   Think about the market this year being down 20-plus percent
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.460]   and you're pulling out your 4%,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.720]   which is the safe withdrawal rule.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.260]   That's an unlucky time.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.960]   So what we're trying to do with the Monte Carlo
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.480]   is create a scenario of probable outcomes.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.400]   We don't know what the future will hold.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.160]   I can guarantee you that whatever number
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.640]   you're coming up with in 40 years
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.200]   will not 100% be the number in 40 years.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.960]   So it's a guidepost to show us
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.720]   what's potentially the outcome,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.600]   and what is our probability of success,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.040]   and I did put an example in the deck there, John,
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.660]   on a probability of success.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.720]   Not to brag, this is my personal plan.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.040]   I have a high savings rate,
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.200]   but essentially it's running 1,000 different trials
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.040]   of what could happen.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.200]   - Jeez, 99% Blair.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.720]   - I'm probably not properly accounting
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.480]   for what my expenses are gonna be in the future,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.200]   if I'm being honest.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   But essentially, all those different squiggly lines
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.440]   are potential outcomes of what my portfolio
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.680]   could be worth now.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.040]   - I like that top line, that looks nice.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.360]   - Life is gonna get in the way.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.720]   I'm gonna buy the big house, or the boat,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.620]   or something's gonna happen.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.520]   My kids are gonna get into some private college
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.560]   that costs a million dollars a year, who knows.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.080]   But essentially, what we're looking for
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.320]   is a high probability of success,
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   because we don't know what the next 40 years will hold.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.040]   The best thing we can do is use history as a guide,
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.780]   and try to run a lot of different scenarios,
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.200]   and come up with this guidestick.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.120]   So essentially, it's because bonds
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.360]   are less volatile than stocks.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.320]   That's the difference in this question.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.360]   - And my way of thinking about using Money Carlo
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.960]   is I would, what's the old quote?
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.800]   I don't know what you could attribute
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.700]   to 12 people online, Benjamin Flanklin,
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.700]   or Albert Einstein, or John Maynard Keynes.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.020]   I would rather be roughly right than precisely wrong.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.700]   And so I think, obviously, you'd rather have
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.360]   actual outcomes to use in probabilities,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.540]   but we don't know what the outcomes are gonna be.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.760]   So you have probabilities, and then you can use
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.940]   those probabilities to update your plan
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.860]   as the actual outcomes happen.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.780]   And then you can also add stuff there,
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.220]   because like you said, your life is gonna change
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.940]   in the future, so in 10 years, you say,
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.220]   well, I'm gonna buy a vacation house.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.700]   How does that impact our probabilities
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.580]   if we pull that lever?
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.020]   How does that change your potential
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.540]   for future spending and your future outcomes?
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.560]   And I think that it's just a good way
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   to have conversations with people to show,
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.880]   this is how making this big change in your life
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.200]   or your financial plan can potentially impact
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.000]   your probability for good outcomes.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.200]   And then when those actual outcomes happen,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.420]   then you see, okay, how close were we?
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.640]   And then you kind of update and go from there.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.160]   - Yeah, and I would add that the goal
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.520]   should never to be to end with the biggest pile of money
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.880]   like Scrooge McDuck, right?
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.680]   You can't take it with you.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.360]   Really, what we're trying to do is save for the future
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.880]   when we won't be working and make sure
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.160]   that there's enough there that if we live a long life
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.800]   that we don't have to change our lifestyle,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.240]   but at the end of the day, you should actually enjoy
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.400]   the fruits of your labor and the goal shouldn't actually be
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.760]   to end with the most amount of money.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.600]   - Duncan, what do you have right now?
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.640]   17% after your stock picks this year?
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.280]   - Probably not even, yeah, it's a rough looking one.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.040]   Yeah, I was gonna say, do you think this is a use case
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.100]   for augmented reality, like one day we'll have a headset
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.160]   that just shows you the Monte Carlo simulation
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.360]   of everything you're about to do?
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.520]   That'd be kind of cool.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.120]   - If visualization helps you achieve your goals,
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   then it might be worth exploring.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.400]   - Sorry, Duncan, I'm out of the metaverse already.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   It's never gonna happen.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.880]   I'm not putting anything in my head.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.680]   - Fast forward to a year from now,
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.360]   Ben wearing a VR headset while we're doing Portfolio Rescue.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.280]   - I was just curious, Ben,
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.920]   are you doing No Shame November?
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.440]   - I guess so, is that what it is?
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.160]   - I don't know, I don't know how many days this is for you.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.120]   - All right, if it happens, I gotta try to match Duncan.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.960]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.080]   - I do No Shame every month.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.600]   - All right, I'm in.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.240]   All right, thanks to Blair for joining us.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.360]   As always, listen in to this in podcast form.

[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.840]   Duncan, we still have the Fed shirt.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.600]   I got mine in the mail, I gotta wear it at one of these.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.880]   - This has been super popular.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.440]   This has been super popular. - That's killer, yeah.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.240]   - Okay, yeah, it's the Fed godfather one, very cool.
