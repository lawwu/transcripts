[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   The following is a conversation with Tim Dillon,
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.520]   a standup comedian who is fearless
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.180]   in challenging the norms of modern day social
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.840]   and political discourse.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.680]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.120]   NetSuite Business Management Software,
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   Athletic Greens All-in-One Nutrition Drink,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040]   Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal,

[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.120]   and Rev Speech-to-Text Service.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   So the choice is business, health, sanity, or transcripts.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.320]   Choose wisely, my friends.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.720]   And if you wish, click the sponsor links below

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.160]   As a side note, let me say that I will continue
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.480]   talking to scientists, engineers, historians,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.440]   mathematicians, and so on.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.920]   But I will also talk to the people
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.840]   who Jack Kerouac called the mad ones
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.640]   in his book "On the Road."
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.000]   That is one of my favorite books.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.680]   He wrote, "The only people for me are the mad ones,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.840]   "the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.060]   "mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time,
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.140]   "the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.060]   "but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles,
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.140]   "exploding like spiders across the stars.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.520]   "And in the middle, you see the blue center light pop,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600]   "and everybody goes, 'Oh.'"
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.220]   Some of these conversations will be a bit of a gamble
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.400]   in that I have no idea how they will turn out,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.460]   but I'm willing to risk it for a chance
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.120]   at a bit of an adventure.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.800]   And I'm happy and honored that Tim, this time,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.020]   wanted to take a chance as well.

[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.600]   And now, here's my conversation with Tim Dillon.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.460]   What would you like your tombstone to read?
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.860]   It's a good way to summarize the essence of a human being.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.580]   - I would like it to say, "This has not been paid for."
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.500]   (Lex laughing)
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   And I want my living relatives to struggle to pay for it,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.380]   and I think I would like them to be hounded every day.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.300]   I would like people to call and go,
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.660]   "Listen, we don't wanna ever excavate a body, but we will,
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.820]   "because this has not been paid for."
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.560]   - I love the idea of leaving the world, like debt,
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.760]   leaving the world in lots of debt
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.920]   that other people have to deal with.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.120]   And I know people that have done that,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   and I know people that have been in families
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.040]   where that's happened, where someone has to sit
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.760]   and just curse the sky,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000]   because they don't have a physical person anymore
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.300]   to be angry at, but they still have to deal
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.080]   with the decisions that person made.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.360]   And that's deeply tragic,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.080]   but that's always struck me as very funny.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.460]   - Well, it's a kind of immortality, the debt,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.140]   'cause if the debt lasts for a long time,
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.000]   the anger lasts for a long time,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.060]   and then you're now immortal in the minds of many.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.400]   You arouse emotion in the minds of many.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.860]   - My mother's best friend in the town I grew up in,
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.860]   her husband shot himself in the driveway,
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.740]   and my mother's friend never got a chance to just grieve,
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.620]   because he owed so much money,
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.340]   she would come over and go, "I hate him.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.480]   "I fucking hate him."
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.800]   And it was just such an interesting thing
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.520]   to see somebody who, and her kids ended up getting angry
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.360]   at her for that, because they didn't understand
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.140]   why she would hate a guy who was clearly suffering,
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.220]   but she goes, "He took the selfish way out.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.760]   "He fucked us."
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880]   And it was always interesting for me to just remember
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.380]   that you can leave Earth and still be a problem.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.760]   (laughing)
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.400]   That's kind of a special person,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.580]   so that's, I think, what I'd like my tombstone to read.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.580]   - Yeah, there's a show called "Louie" with Louis C.K.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.420]   I don't know if you've watched it.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.500]   - Yes, I'm aware of it.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140]   - There's this moment, I think,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.220]   where an old guy's talking to Louis
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.520]   about the best part about love is after you break up,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.400]   and it's remembering that,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.700]   remembering the good times and feeling that loss,
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.220]   the pain of that loss.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.420]   The worst part about love
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.540]   is when you no longer feel that pain.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.360]   - Interesting.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.700]   - The pain of losing somebody lasts longer,
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.620]   is more intense and lasts longer than the actual love.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.500]   So his argument was like the pain is what love really is.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.340]   - Wow.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.120]   - In the same way that anger,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.620]   your tombstone, what arouses, will last longer.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.580]   And that's deeply like a human thing.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.340]   Why do we attach happiness
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.580]   to the way we should remember others?
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   It could be just anger.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.220]   - I know so many people
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.440]   who will have deeply complicated feelings when,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.220]   I did drugs for many years,
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.700]   and I spent time with some wild people,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.260]   and their parents were also wild people.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.140]   And some of their parents have done crazy things to them,
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.900]   and have created situations
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.900]   that were not productive for child-rearing.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.180]   And so I know that when those people die,
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.580]   it's going to be a very mixed bag.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.660]   Like there's going to be a lot of complex emotions,
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.620]   like, "Hey, we loved that guy,
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.140]   but also when we look back,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.020]   he was a horrible father, a horrible husband,
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.340]   but he was fun."
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.500]   And we don't put enough stock in that,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.380]   but there will be a push and pull.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.920]   And I'll be the one kind of bringing up like,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.160]   "Hey, he was a lot of fun."
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.460]   He was a lot, remember when he stuck us,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.300]   one of the things,
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.220]   this particular person I'm talking about,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.820]   we were at a bar,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.500]   me and my friend were there, we're having dinner,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.580]   and his father who was an alcoholic,
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.980]   and a guy that would go out every night,
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.720]   and didn't work, refused to work,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.540]   would lie and say he was going to work,
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.500]   and then go to a bar.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.760]   I mean, just a fun person.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.140]   And we were sitting at this bar restaurant,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.980]   and the bartender,
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.260]   we see his father walk up to the bartender and say,
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.140]   "Point at us, point at our table,
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.540]   and go and put the thumbs up."
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.940]   And the bartender nodded,
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.620]   and then the father walked over to our table,
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.920]   and he said, "Listen, I just want to let you know,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.260]   I just bought you dinner."
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.620]   And I looked at his son,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.380]   I said, "He's a pretty good guy."
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.860]   And then he climbed over the little fence
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.700]   down to the water,
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.520]   got in his little boat,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.360]   it was a little cigarette boat,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.660]   and he just drove away.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.900]   And then about an hour later,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.380]   we went and we said,
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.900]   "I think that guy took care of the bill."
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.540]   But she said, "Well, go talk to the bartender."
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.460]   So we talked to the bartender,
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.100]   and he goes, he handed us a bill,
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.460]   and the bill was for like $1,000.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.420]   And we said, "Wait a minute, what the hell's going on?"
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.500]   And he goes, "The guy that left an hour ago
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.100]   said you were gonna take care of his bill,
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.340]   he's been drinking here all week."
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.060]   And we go, "What are you talking about?"
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.900]   And he goes, "Remember, he pointed at you,
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.540]   he put the thumbs up, and you guys waved?"
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.300]   You remember that?
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.420]   And the guy goes, and we went,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.020]   "Yeah," and I just looked at my friend,
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.860]   my friend and I went,
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.340]   "You know, your dad is just,
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.100]   we're gonna remember him for all kinds of reasons."
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.580]   - But to you, he was fun?
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.420]   - He was a lot of fun, he wasn't my dad.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.500]   But I spent a lot of time with him.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   I was in two boating accidents with him.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.420]   You know, two boating accidents--
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.740]   - Alcohol involved?
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.740]   Drugs involved? - Yes, he was,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.300]   usually alcohol was involved when he left his house.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.820]   And when he was at home as well.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.220]   But I was in two boating accidents.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.860]   And do you know how fun someone has to be
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.780]   to get in a second boating accident?
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.700]   (laughing)
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.860]   Do you know what a good time someone has to be
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.700]   to get in a boat with them
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.660]   after you've already gotten in one wreck?
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.020]   - Never get fooled again, what was that line, George Bush?
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.380]   Never get fooled again?
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.340]   - Right.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.340]   Yeah, so if you're getting fooled again,
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.180]   you know, there's a reason for it.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.540]   But he was a fun guy.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   He did have a death wish.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.300]   The second boating accident, he grabbed me and said,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.460]   "You can't hang out with me anymore."
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.300]   And I said, "Why?"
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.820]   He goes, "I'm trying to kill myself."
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.980]   And I was like, "Oh."
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.700]   And then I understood that like,
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.740]   all of the fun, under the fun,
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.140]   lived a very destructive person
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.380]   who not only was destructive, but wanted to die.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.900]   - So speaking of fun people that wanna die,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.260]   I don't know if you're,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.660]   we can go Hunter S. Thompson,
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.380]   but Charles Bukowski, I don't know if you're aware of the guy.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.300]   - I'm aware of him, sure.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.900]   I've read some of his stuff.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.820]   - So his tombstone says,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.460]   I just wanted to ask you a question about it.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.420]   His tombstone says, "Don't try."
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.620]   - Interesting.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.260]   - What do you think about that advice
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.980]   as a way to approach life?
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.060]   - I think for many people, it's a good advice.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.940]   Because the people that are gonna try will do anyway.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.300]   And the people that need to be told,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.260]   there's a whole cottage industry now
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.140]   of motivational speakers and life coaches and gurus
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.900]   that tell people that they all have to own their own business
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.940]   and be their own boss and be a disruptor
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.180]   and get into industries.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.500]   That's incredibly unrealistic for most people.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.180]   Most people are not suited for that.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.700]   And the Gary V's of the world that tell everybody
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.140]   that they should just hustle and grind
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.980]   and hustle and grind.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.100]   They're very light on the specifics
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.140]   of what they should actually do.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.740]   Yeah, I think a lot of people,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.140]   that's not horrible advice to give to a lot of people.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.180]   I think my generation got horrible advice
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.620]   from our parents, from our teachers.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.660]   And that advice was follow your dreams.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.260]   And that was it, by the way.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.520]   There was no like, what are your dreams?
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.660]   Are they realistic?
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.300]   What happens when they don't work out?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.780]   Will your dreams make you happy?
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.860]   Are your dreams real?
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.620]   Do they exist on earth?
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.700]   Can you follow, anybody follow your dreams?
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.860]   You can be anything you wanna be.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.100]   Horrible advice.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.140]   Horrible advice.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.660]   Worst advice you could ever give a generation of people.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.780]   Really, truly.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.020]   I mean, think about it.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.140]   If you were talking to somebody
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.200]   and you were trying to make them succeed,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.560]   are there any two worse pieces of advice to give them
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.140]   than follow your dreams
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.640]   and you can be anything you want to be?
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.820]   Those to me are the two most destructive pieces
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.140]   of information I've ever heard.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.820]   - So let me push back because--
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.660]   - Okay, that's fair.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.820]   Many people do.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.860]   So yeah, this is like a rigorous journalistic interview.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.020]   Larry King, by the way, passed away today.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.580]   So I'm taking over the--
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.420]   - It's very sad.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.260]   - I'm carrying the--
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.080]   - Very sad.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.700]   RIP King.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.180]   - Yeah, what was I even gonna say?
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.660]   Oh, let me push back on the follow your dream thing
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.260]   is I come from an immigrant family
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.160]   where I was always working extremely hard at stuff,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.700]   like in a stupid way.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.900]   There's something about me
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.580]   that loves hitting my head against the wall
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.900]   over and over and over
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.380]   until either my head breaks or the wall breaks.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.200]   Just like I love that dedication for no purpose whatsoever.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.060]   It's like the mouse that's stuck in a cage or whatever.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.620]   And everybody always told me, my family,
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.020]   the people around me,
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.880]   the sort of, the epitome of what I could achieve
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.740]   is to be kind of a stable job.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.720]   The old like lawyer, doctor,
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   in my case, it's like scientist and so on.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.200]   But I had these dreams, I had this fire about,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   I love robots and that nobody ever gave me permission
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.400]   to pursue those dreams.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   I know you're supposed to grab it yourself.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.000]   Nobody's supposed to give you permission,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.060]   but there's something about just people saying,
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.740]   fuck what everyone else thinks,
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.760]   like giving you permission,
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.480]   a parent or somebody like that saying, do your own thing.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.520]   Go become an actor, go become like,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.280]   do the crazy thing you're not supposed to do, an artist,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.000]   go build a company, quit school, all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.220]   - Yes, sure.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.180]   - That's the pushback against the,
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.680]   follow your dreams as bad advice.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.160]   - In mass, if you were to look at, in mass,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.200]   if you were to look at statistically
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.400]   how few people that works out for,
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.000]   I'm just, no, but let's be very honest.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.840]   - This is very true, yeah.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.660]   - Be very honest.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.560]   So I mean like, yeah, if you're gonna go be an actor,
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.040]   hey, I was broke for 10 years
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.640]   before I became a, before I was making money as a comedian.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.860]   I get it.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.400]   I didn't need Gary Vaynerchuk
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.760]   to tell me to follow my thing, right?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.580]   And here's the other thing.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.200]   I was kind of funny and like, I was kind of,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.760]   a lot of things were in my favor of being a comedian, right?
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.120]   I had this kind of crazy fucked up life.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.520]   I had a lot of stories.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.960]   I had exhausted, I was willing to fail.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.720]   I had failed before.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.580]   I was broke.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.000]   I didn't care about being broke.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.720]   I knew how to be broke.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.360]   I had, I was shameless to a degree.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.560]   I was, I would get on a stage night after night
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.880]   and be laughed at.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.040]   I would, I had a high threshold for being embarrassed.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.880]   I had a high threshold for people thinking
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.840]   that I was a scumbag, right?
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   And showing up at family parties and being like, yeah,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.320]   I still really don't have a job.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.600]   And I'm just, I work at comedy clubs kind of,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.000]   and I get booked when I can.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.520]   And I was, you know, suited for it.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.080]   There's this idea that people can just roam
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   around the world injecting themselves into other things
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.440]   they have no aptitude for at all.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.280]   And will that to happen?
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.120]   A small percentage of people might be able to do that.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.180]   But the vast majority of people have something
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.800]   they might key into that they're meant to do.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.320]   Like you loved robots, you love technology,
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.840]   and you found a place in that world where you thrive.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.180]   But I think many people, a lot of people love robots, right?
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.460]   So a lot of people think everything you do is interesting.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.180]   I think your shit is fascinating.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.620]   I watch your podcast and I think it's very interesting.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.280]   I have no place in your world.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.060]   I have no place in that world.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.020]   I don't like remedial math.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.420]   I don't like community college math.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.340]   I think it's a waste of my time.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.300]   - What do you think about robot?
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.580]   Would you ever buy a robot for your home?
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.740]   - Yes.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.180]   What will it do?
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.900]   - I'll be a companion, a friend.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.780]   - Oh yeah, I mean, I would like to start replacing
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.060]   friends and family with robots immediately.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.260]   I mean, truly, truly.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.620]   I mean, I'm not even kidding.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.740]   Like I would like to have a Thanksgiving with four robots.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.900]   I'm dead serious.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.060]   Are they into QAnon?
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   Like are the robots, when do the robots start going crazy?
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.020]   That's my question is like,
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.700]   how long do the robots live with me
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.620]   before they are also a problem?
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.500]   And I got to replace them.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.460]   - You're going to indoctrinate the robot.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.140]   - The robot's going to call me like my aunt does
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.540]   and talk about coronavirus for an hour every morning
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.940]   and tell me everyone in America who's died of coronavirus.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.740]   - One of the things I enjoy in life
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.180]   is how terrified people like you,
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.340]   I'm a huge fan by the way, get in front of robots.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.300]   - Well, I am concerned about AI
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.620]   like completely getting rid of the need for human beings
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.020]   because human beings, I mean,
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.500]   you go out in the street and you go,
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.460]   so few of these people are necessary.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.220]   Even now, even now you look at people and you go,
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.060]   they're hanging on by a thread, right?
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.980]   And you can just imagine
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.060]   how many jobs are going to get replaced,
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.820]   how many industries are going to be completely remade
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.700]   with AI and the pace of change worries me a little bit
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.260]   because we do a very bad job in this country of mitigation
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.540]   when we have problems.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.620]   We don't do a great job.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.180]   We did a not great job with COVID, right?
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.020]   We don't do a good job.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.260]   It's just something we don't do well.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.860]   We're good in booms and busts.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.140]   We're good when it's good.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.300]   And we're actually, we kind of know how to kind of like,
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.620]   hey, we're bottomed out.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.820]   We're like a gambling addict in this country.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.060]   We know what it feels like to be outside of an OTB
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.100]   at 9 a.m. drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.820]   going, I'm going to build it back.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.580]   And we know what it's like to win,
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.700]   but anything in between, it seems not that great.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.020]   So to me, it feels like, are we going to be able to like
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.700]   help people that are displaced
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.060]   and that have their jobs taken by, I mean,
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.700]   do you not fear sort of a world where you have a lot of,
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.140]   you know, artificial intelligence replacing workers
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.300]   and then what happens?
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.100]   - There's a lot of fears around artificial intelligence.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.460]   One of them is yes, displacement of jobs, workers.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.340]   That's technology in general.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.340]   That's just any kind of new innovations, displaced jobs.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.420]   I'm less worried about that.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.860]   I'm more worried about other impacts
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.900]   of artificial intelligence.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.620]   For example, the nature of our discourse, like social,
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.060]   the effects of algorithms on the way we communicate
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.700]   with each other, the spread of information,
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.380]   what that information looks like,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.060]   the creation of silos, all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.660]   I think that would just make worse the effects
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.140]   that the displacement of jobs has.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.380]   I think ultimately, I have a hope that technology
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.780]   creates more opportunities than it destroys.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.900]   - I hope so too.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   - And so in that sense, AI to me is an exciting possibility.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.020]   But you know, the challenges this world presents
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.020]   will create divisions, will create chaos and so on.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.900]   So I'm more focused on the way we deal as a society
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.020]   with that chaos, the way we talk to each other.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.860]   - That's huge.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.740]   - Creating the platform that's healthy for that.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.660]   - Now as a comedian, creator, whatever you wanna call it,
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.740]   people that put out content,
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.220]   the gatekeepers are now algorithmic, right?
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.300]   So they are kind of almost AI ready.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.620]   So if you are a person that puts out YouTube videos,
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.020]   podcasts, whatever you're doing,
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.220]   it used to be a guy in the back of the room with a cigar
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.240]   saying, "I like you," or "Get him out of here."
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.420]   Now it's an algorithm you barely understand.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.100]   Like I've talked to people at YouTube,
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.580]   but I don't know if they understand the algorithm.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.420]   - They don't.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.240]   - They don't.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.080]   - This is fascinating.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.220]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.660]   'Cause I speak to people at YouTube and I go,
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.100]   "Hey man, what's going on here?"
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.380]   One of my episode titles of my podcast
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.540]   was called "Knife Fight in Malibu."
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.560]   It was about real estate.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.900]   And it was because a realtor in Malibu,
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.180]   I was trying to get a summer rental,
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.220]   which I can't really afford,
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.500]   but I don't think that's a huge problem.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.540]   I follow my dreams.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.520]   So I called a realtor and she said,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.360]   "Listen," she goes,
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.820]   "I don't know what the government's saying,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.340]   "but it's a real knife fight out here."
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.100]   You know, an old grizzled woman, real realtor,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.700]   tan skin, cig out the mouth, driving a Porsche.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.180]   It's a real knife fight out here.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.540]   You know, her entire life had become real estate.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.060]   Her soul had been hollowed out.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.780]   Her kids hate her.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.980]   No one's made her come in years,
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.180]   but she just loves heating kitchen floors and views.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.020]   Fun.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.820]   She's a demon from hell and we need them, truly.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.940]   We're getting rid of them.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.180]   It's not good.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.980]   And she goes, "It's a real knife fight out here."
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.060]   So we put that in the episode title.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.980]   And of course, I guess some algorithm thought
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.180]   that we were showing people stabbing each other in Wendy's
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.780]   and we got demonetized.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.860]   Did we get demonetized?
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.180]   - We didn't get demonetized, but we lost 80,000 views.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.260]   - We lost a lot of views
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.860]   'cause we were kicked out of whatever,
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.700]   we were just kicked out.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.340]   And I was asking YouTube about it.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.620]   They were kind of understanding it,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.340]   but even the people that worked there
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.860]   didn't truly seem to understand the algorithm.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.620]   So can you explain to me how that works
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.300]   where they barely know what's going on?
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.220]   - No, they do not understand the full dynamics
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.540]   of the monster or the amazing thing that they've created.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.540]   It's the amount of content that's being created
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.380]   is larger than anyone understands.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.540]   Like this is huge.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.460]   They can't deal with it.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.860]   The teams aren't large enough to deal with it.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.140]   There's like special cases.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.660]   So if you fall into the category of special cases,
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.260]   we can maybe talk about that, like a Donald Trump,
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.140]   where you like actually have meetings
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.280]   about what to do with this particular account.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.880]   But everything outside of that is all algorithms.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.780]   They get reported by people and they get,
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.180]   they give enough people to report a particular video,
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.780]   a particular tweet.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.620]   It rises up to where humans look over it.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.900]   But the initial step of the reporting
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.540]   and the rising up to the human supervision
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.540]   is done by algorithm
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.340]   and they don't understand the dynamics of that.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.500]   'Cause we're talking about billions of tweets.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.460]   We're talking about hundreds of thousands of hours
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.300]   of video uploaded every day.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   Now, the hilarity of it is that most of the YouTube algorithm
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.260]   is based on the title.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.420]   - That's crazy.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.620]   - And the description is a small contribution
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.580]   in terms of filtering,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.860]   in terms of the knife fight situation.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.580]   And that's all they can do.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.580]   They cannot, they don't have algorithms at all
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.480]   that are able to process the content of the video.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.780]   So they try to also infer information based on
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.220]   if you're watching all of these QAnon videos
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.280]   or something like that, or Flat Earth videos,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.860]   and you also watch, are really excitedly watching
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.360]   the whole knife fight in Malibu video.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   That says, that increases the chance that the knife fight
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.780]   is a dangerous video for society or something like that.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.980]   - Interesting, wow.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.820]   - Based on their contribution.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.140]   - So if people are watching something,
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.780]   'cause I watch QAnon and Flat Earth videos to ridicule them.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.620]   - Right.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.440]   - That, you know what I mean?
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.020]   I watch these videos and I make fun of them on my show.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.260]   But what's interesting is if I then go watch something else,
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.420]   I'm increasing the likelihood that that video
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.340]   is gonna get looked at as potentially subversive
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.180]   or dangerous.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.000]   - Exactly.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.840]   - That's why.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.020]   - So they make decisions about who you are,
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.300]   who you are as a human being, as a watcher,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.980]   the visual user, based on the clusters of videos you're in.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.500]   But those clusters are not manually determined,
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.220]   they're automatically clustered.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.640]   - It's so weird.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.260]   We have titles where they got upset about
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.980]   and I don't even understand.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.820]   - Yeah.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.840]   - Like we had a title that was so innocuous in my opinion,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.140]   and the title of the episode was called Bomb Disney World.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   And I was asking people to consider bombing Disney World.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.940]   And YouTube got angry at that.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.660]   So you don't know why.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.500]   You can never understand why.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.740]   - You could have said Disney World is the bombs.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.900]   - Right, right, right.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.060]   - It's just rearranging.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.900]   That's what it probably meant.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.720]   - I wasn't saying to do it,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.220]   but I was saying let's start thinking about plans to do,
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.780]   like not let's do it, but let's get in the mind.
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.380]   Let's change the conversation.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.220]   - Yeah.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.860]   - I think it's very interesting because as a comedian,
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.940]   you don't wanna live in that world
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.980]   of worrying about algorithms.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.980]   You don't wanna worry about deplatforming and shadowbanning.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.840]   I mean, all these conversations that I've had
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.460]   with other comedians about shadowbanning,
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.340]   I mean, it's hilarious.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.180]   We all call each other.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.700]   I think I'm being shadowbanned.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.260]   Are you being shadowbanned?
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.620]   And nobody knew what that word was a month ago,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.500]   I mean, a year ago, but everyone now is convinced
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.340]   that everything they do that isn't succeeding
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.180]   is being shadowbanned.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.020]   - Yeah.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.080]   - So it's this new paranoia,
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.340]   this algorithmic paranoia now that we all kind of have
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.680]   because there are genuine instances
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.620]   of people being taken out of an algorithm,
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.980]   you know, rightly or wrongly,
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.740]   for however you wanna believe.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.900]   But then there are also things
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.060]   that just don't perform as well.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.060]   For a myriad of reasons.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.660]   And then we're all saying like, well, they're against me.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.940]   They're shutting me down.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.060]   And you don't know if that's true or not, you know?
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.540]   - What do you think about this moment in history,
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.940]   which was really troubling to me?
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.900]   We could talk about several troubling aspects,
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   but one is Amazon removing Parler from AWS.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.780]   To me, that was the most clearly troubling.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.820]   It felt like it created a more dangerous world
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.820]   when the infrastructure on which you have competing
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:27.060]   medium of communications now puts its finger on the scale,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.660]   now influences who wins and who loses.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.700]   - Absolutely, you're right.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.260]   And what you're always told is like,
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.180]   if you don't like Twitter, create your own service.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.020]   - Right.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.140]   - Or if you don't like something, you can do your own thing.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.140]   Or if you are, and basically because tech,
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.060]   you have to be in business with one of five companies.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.780]   I think it's like Amazon, Facebook, Google,
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.580]   YouTube, and Twitter, whatever.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.540]   Like, I mean, Amazon puts everything on the cloud.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.700]   Google and YouTube, it's all basically the SEO
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.580]   and the advertising and you got to get your name out there.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.100]   You don't want to be buried in every,
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.060]   like because you have to do business with it.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.660]   It's a cartel of these companies.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.980]   You understand it better than anybody
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.020]   that you are prevented, truly.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.980]   And I think whatever you think about Parler,
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.140]   whatever you think about what people are saying on Parler,
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.860]   whatever you think about Alex Jones,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.060]   whatever you thought about Mila Yiannopoulos,
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.580]   the state has an interest in,
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.540]   and has always had an interest in crushing dissent.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.100]   This is what the state has done.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.940]   This is how they retain the power they have
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.580]   by eliminating dissent where they can.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.580]   Now, because you don't have three broadcast networks
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.540]   anymore and a handful of newspapers
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.300]   that were all run, by the way,
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.700]   by people that had been either compromised
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.700]   or happily going with the program,
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.700]   and you have this wild west of the internet,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.500]   people like me, people that make,
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.340]   I make funny content that I hope is funny,
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.620]   but a lot of it is wild and crazy.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.880]   I say a lot of wild and crazy things.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.980]   They're very funny.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.660]   I say a lot of wild and crazy things about powerful people.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.380]   - Yeah, you mock the powerful in there
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.300]   by bringing them down a notch.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.460]   We'll probably talk about it,
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.020]   but humor is one of the tools
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:17.380]   to balance the powers in society.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.980]   - Well, sure, and to make people feel better about things,
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.600]   and to, you know, whatever the case may be, right?
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.980]   That's my goal is to kind of like,
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.700]   hey, people have had a shitty day.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.420]   If this video or podcast makes you laugh, that's great.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.100]   I think that it was never gonna stop at Alex Jones.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.220]   Not that I think he should have been taking off
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.700]   everything the way he was,
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.540]   but this keeps going until we have sanitized
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.700]   all of social media.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.980]   And what they really want it to be
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.740]   is what Instagram's kind of becoming,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.560]   which is a marketplace of,
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.060]   you could just go and buy sneakers,
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.260]   go buy a sweatshirt, go buy jeans,
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.740]   go buy this, go buy that.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.140]   And the idea of the free exchange of information
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.380]   seems to be the old internet.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.940]   And it seems the new internet seems to be, you know,
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.540]   hyper, and I'm a capitalist,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.140]   but this is like hyper-capitalist
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.820]   in the sense of like, they only want you consuming things
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.100]   and they don't want you thinking too much.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.580]   And that seems to be where it's heading.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.940]   I've even seen that with Instagram
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.180]   where it's like everything on Instagram
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.100]   is like, buy a sweatshirt, you know?
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.140]   And I'm like, all right, man.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.180]   Hey man, if I want a sweatshirt, I'll get it.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.140]   Like, relax.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.900]   You know, just every ad seems to be encouraging consumption,
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.880]   but very few things seem geared towards,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.540]   hey, let's have a dialogue or let's,
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.020]   and not that Instagram was ever great for that,
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.620]   but like, if everything's geared now
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.460]   towards content on Instagram,
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.860]   a lot of it seems geared towards shopping.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.060]   - See, I don't know.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.020]   That's an interesting point.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.900]   I don't know if the consumerism that capitalism leads to
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.820]   is necessarily gets in the way of nuanced conversation.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.220]   I feel like you could still sell Tim Dillon sweatshirts
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.700]   and have a difficult nuanced conversation
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.540]   or mock the current president, the previous president,
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.460]   mock the powerful, all that kind of stuff.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.300]   - Yeah, we try.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.120]   We try to balance that.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.100]   - Do you have sweatshirts?
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.940]   - We do.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.320]   Are they on sale now, fake business?
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.120]   We do, fake business sweatshirt
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.420]   with the Enron logo, fake business.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.300]   'Cause I do fake business all the time.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.860]   - It'd be nice if we talk about Alex Jones
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.300]   if you plug the sweatshirt during that conversation.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   - Yeah, we'll do that, absolutely.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.220]   But what I tend to worry about with,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.640]   I see social media and technology
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.320]   existing to flatten society.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.460]   It makes people very boring.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.700]   All of the experiences kids have right now are online.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.620]   Many of their closest friendships are online.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.940]   Their first relationships are online.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.660]   The culture is very homogenous.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.980]   And I think it's eliminating characters.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.700]   It's eliminating interesting people.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.220]   It's making people into AI.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.060]   All of their tastes.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.900]   - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.980]   - AI could be Charles Bukowski as well.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.900]   Let's not get crazy.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.660]   - It's not there yet, right?
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.760]   I mean, the $75,000 dog is not doing anything.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.400]   So we're not there yet.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.320]   Listen, I get why you like AI so much.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.320]   I hate people too.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   And I'm very amenable to AI.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.960]   And I agree with you.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.120]   Listen, I think the future,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.760]   we gotta get everyone out of here.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.760]   I'm with you on that.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.600]   So don't think I'm--
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.420]   - I love people.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.760]   He's manipulating my mind and my--
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.840]   - That's why the flash of light in your eyes
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.400]   when you talked about that dog
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.160]   was so much more than any person.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.080]   And I get it, by the way.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.920]   - You're right.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.040]   - I love people, but if we could--
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   - They're not exciting.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.840]   - If we could just use robots to kill most of them,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.880]   I think that would be good for society.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.160]   - I'm with that too.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.560]   But I think that social media flattens people.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.320]   - Flattening the personalities of characters.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.600]   - Flattening the personalities of people, man.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.200]   And it's just, when's the last time,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.600]   I like the idea of,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.000]   somebody showing up to high school with a backpack
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.360]   and taking out an old CD and being like,
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.040]   hey man, here's this band you've never heard of
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.280]   that I love or whatever, you gotta get into this.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.080]   And I'm like, when I talk to young,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.360]   you know I have friends that have younger brothers
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.960]   and everything, and I know that the dominant culture
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.440]   was always dominant, I'm not an idiot,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.480]   but I feel like it's harder to be unique and original now
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.000]   because so much of what's promoted
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.360]   is just this way to kind of corral people
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.700]   into believing and thinking a certain set of ideals
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.800]   that's constantly shifting and evolving.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.400]   And people are just caught up in that.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.280]   And to me, it gets very boring, very quickly.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.720]   I hate being bored, and that's what it is.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.640]   - I don't know what to do with that,
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.160]   because at the same time, podcasts are really popular,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.680]   long form podcasts are really popular,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.360]   and people are hungry for those kinds of conversations.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.080]   There's a lot of dangerous ideas, quote unquote,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.960]   flowing, being spread around through podcasts.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.680]   Meaning just like debates.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.820]   - Correct.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.640]   - So that's still popular, so I don't know what to--
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.460]   - I agree with you.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.480]   - That gives me hope, I guess.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.320]   - I hope so too.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.400]   And like I said, I look at the negative a lot
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.200]   'cause that's what I usually make fun of,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.040]   but there's a lot of positive stuff happening too.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.120]   - Let's talk a bit about Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.800]   So you've gotten a chance to talk to him
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.120]   while you were on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.920]   - I've been on Alex's show, I've had Alex on my show,
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.280]   I've talked to Alex for three hours in front of,
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.360]   I guess it was maybe like 15 million people, right,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.680]   on Joe's show, it was a really wild conversation.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.320]   I think it was one of the coolest moments in broadcasting
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.800]   that clearly that I've ever been a part of,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.200]   but I think it goes in the lexicon of like,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.280]   these are big podcasts.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.200]   Like I think it's one of the biggest podcasts.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.320]   A week before the election, Alex Jones,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   I'm really grateful that Joe gave me the opportunity
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.680]   to be there, and it was just an amazing conversation
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.520]   to watch.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.680]   - What was the shirt you wore, Julian Maxwell?
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.560]   - "Frieges Lane," it was a fun joke that no one in tech got
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.800]   because we all know how funny they are.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.560]   But the tech writers, which is mainly blue haired--
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.760]   - I do not agree with these statements.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.680]   - Mainly blue haired people whose goal in life
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.480]   is to find things to give them orgasms with, you know.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.200]   - If you want to dye your hair blue, it's your choice.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.040]   I respect it.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.560]   - Yeah, but is it your choice?
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.360]   But at the end of the day, it's like,
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.560]   you know, all the tech writers, like a lot of people just,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.960]   and I'm not, I'm just maligning tech unfairly,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.680]   but a lot of people that censors the humor were like,
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.840]   he's advocating for human trafficker.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.000]   I'm like, it's clearly a joke
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.280]   because we're coming off the believe all women.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.120]   - Yes.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   - We're coming off that, and it's very funny
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.400]   to just say "Frieges Lane," hey man, believe all women.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.880]   Like, it's just, our politics and our public sphere
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.400]   is so schizophrenic right now that when you point that out,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.920]   people are going to be angry with you.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.720]   But that was a fun shirt to wear.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.440]   - But on Alex, you know, I was one of the people
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.320]   that found him really entertaining.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.600]   That the same kind of thing as with Bukowski,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   these kinds of personalities that are wild,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.800]   crazy, full of ideas,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.480]   they don't have to be grounded in truth at all,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.840]   or they can be grounded in truth a little bit.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.080]   Like, he's just playing with ideas,
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.920]   like a jazz musician, screaming sometimes.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.800]   Obviously he has some demons.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.240]   Sometimes he's super angry for no reason whatsoever.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.480]   It's some weird thing that he's constructed in his own head.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.360]   Sometimes he's super loving and peaceful,
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.400]   especially lately that I've heard him.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.160]   I don't know if you've seen him with Michael Malice,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.360]   where he's doing, like Malice was doing,
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.000]   like, well, telling Alex Jones, "I love you, Alex."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   You know, just this loving kind of softness
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.160]   and kindness underneath it all.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.600]   I don't know what to make of any of it.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.520]   And then there's this huge number of people
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.800]   that tell me that Alex Jones is dangerous for society.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.640]   - Right.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   - So what do you do with that?
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.360]   Do you think he's dangerous for society?
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.000]   Do you think he is one of the sort of
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.480]   entertaining personalities of our time
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.800]   that shouldn't be suppressed, or somewhere in between?
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.480]   - I don't think that Alex, per se,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.880]   is dangerous for society.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.760]   I think the greater danger for society
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.040]   comes, again, from stifling all dissent, right?
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.120]   All, like anybody with a voice that uses it
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.920]   that critiques the government.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   And putting all of those people in a category
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.280]   and getting rid of them is incredibly dangerous.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.840]   To me, more so.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.440]   I think the biggest problem that Alex has ever had
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.160]   was when he questioned the Sandy Hook shooting.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   And that really was, 'cause it really is this
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.960]   identifiable incident that you can look at
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.480]   where it did get away from him,
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.880]   and a lot of his fans who,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.760]   the people that are attracted to conspiracy stuff,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.040]   and I have some of those fans,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.840]   some of them are really smart people,
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.480]   some of them are mentally unwell.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.680]   A lot of them happen to be mentally unwell.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.160]   So when you have a fan base of people
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.920]   where some of them are mentally unwell,
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   and you are questioning, you know, tragic events, okay?
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.520]   And Alex was right about Epstein.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.680]   He was right about a lot of things.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.360]   And he's got no credit for that.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.840]   And I understand that this,
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.480]   sometimes when you're right about 10 things
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.800]   and you're wrong about something,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.560]   and the thing you're wrong about is so offensive to people,
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.600]   you're never gonna get any credit for being right,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.880]   even though you were right more than when you were wrong.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.960]   The problem was a lot of his fans who were crazy
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.500]   stalked, harassed these families,
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.040]   and accused them of being actors,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.680]   and accused them of like faking their children's deaths.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.040]   It was this horrific experience.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.080]   And Alex is tied to that.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.960]   And, you know, how much he inspired that
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.540]   by what he did on his show, I don't know,
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.160]   because I haven't watched hours and hours
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.660]   of that particular thing, like the whole Sandy Hook thing.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.720]   If you listen to him, he says, "I really covered it.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.440]   I kind of covered it and moved on."
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.020]   Other people go, "No, he spent a long time on it."
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.120]   But that's the real danger of going into that territory
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.620]   over and over again, going,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.040]   "Everything's a false flag," or "Everything's fake."
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.400]   I think Alex has actually been kind of reasonable.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.880]   Like he's resisted a lot of the politics
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.560]   of like racial resentment on like the alt-right,
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.160]   for example, he's resisted that.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.420]   He's resisted the anti-Semitic currents
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.240]   of a lot of that politics, right?
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   He's resisted a lot of the virulently anti-trans
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.440]   or anti-gay stuff.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.000]   Now, he does dip his toe into the water
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.720]   of like the culture wars, of course he does.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.640]   But I've never really seen him,
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.120]   and I could be wrong about this,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.560]   embrace white nationalism or identitarianism.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.540]   I've never seen him really go anti-Semitic.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.920]   I've never seen him take that route.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.360]   When I grew up, and I would turn him on every now and then,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.280]   he was talking about NAFTA, the WTO,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.520]   he's talking about 9/11,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.820]   he was talking about the World Trade Organizations
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.080]   and a lot of these big conferences,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.880]   whether it was the Bilderberg Group,
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.860]   whether it was Bohemian Grove, which he infiltrated.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.700]   And he was talking about,
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.480]   "Hey, here are the most powerful people in the world,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.800]   and here's what they're doing,
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.240]   and here's how it affects you."
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.600]   And that was interesting to me,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.760]   because no one else was really talking about it,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.120]   except Alex Jones.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.060]   Occasionally Art Bell on WABC,
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.900]   you'd listen to him at night, right?
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.220]   I think Alex became very controversial
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.060]   when he decided to back Donald Trump.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.980]   And then he has a considerable following
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.660]   and a considerable audience
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.780]   that he was then able to marshal
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.980]   in the direction of supporting Donald Trump.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.020]   That was when the spotlight,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.660]   because then he was talking to Trump,
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.540]   Trump did his show,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.380]   Alex Jones just got bigger, right?
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.020]   I mean, he blew up, that's the term, right?
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.860]   He blew up.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.380]   Like he had the good,
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.820]   he put out the good HBO special,
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.660]   whatever you want to call it.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.060]   He has a hit song.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:16.900]   He blew up.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.540]   And then people started looking at the things
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.260]   that he was associated with.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.180]   The Sandy Hook thing is a blemish on his record.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.660]   I do believe he regrets it.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.580]   But again, I do see the point of the families
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.580]   who are like, "Dude, fuck this guy forever.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.340]   This is the worst thing I ever went through."
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.020]   It's a very tough...
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.680]   I understand the people that say that.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.620]   I understand, and I understand the people that go,
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.780]   "When you have tech companies
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.260]   that act in a coordinated manner
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.660]   to just get rid of someone,
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.620]   they don't have any way to defend themselves."
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.540]   It's a little terrifying when you think about
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.380]   that power being abused,
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.500]   and how wouldn't it be?
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.060]   - Do you think he should not have been banned
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.140]   from all these platforms?
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.540]   - I don't think, I do think that
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.680]   if you are a private company, right?
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.700]   I do think, and this is where you run into this problem.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.660]   I don't know if these tech companies
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.940]   were government utilities,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.020]   would that decrease people's likelihood of being banned?
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.860]   I don't know, right?
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.180]   So I understand the benefit
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.140]   of them being treated like public utilities
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.940]   and people thinking they have the right to a Twitter.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.460]   I've never, I don't know, I have very little confidence.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.100]   I mean, the government's trying to roll out a vaccine
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.580]   in California, and we vaccinated like five people,
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.740]   I mean, in terms of what we need to do in the state, right?
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.220]   So maybe if it was a government utility,
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.620]   I do think someone like Alex,
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.700]   like there should be some process.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.040]   So if you're gonna get rid of someone,
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.300]   they should have a way to defend themselves.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   There should be more democratic process
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.860]   that you can go through
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.580]   than just being unilaterally taken off something.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.180]   But like, then you run into the,
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.820]   you're like, am I gonna say that everyone deserves,
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.920]   no, if you're threatening or harassing people
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.980]   or threatening to kill them,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.260]   publishing their private information,
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.860]   if you're committing crimes on these platforms,
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.820]   obviously the people that own these platforms
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.420]   are gonna be like, we're not gonna allow this to happen.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.300]   So I understand that there is a line, right?
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.640]   There is some, like people that say there's no line
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.020]   aren't really thinking, like there is a line.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.700]   I just don't, that line seems to be moving all the time,
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.000]   and it seems to be a very hard thing to police.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.220]   But I don't think you can remove a guy off everything.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.040]   And then also bank accounts won't give him debit cards
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.420]   or credit cards, I don't know if you talked to him
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.140]   about that, but like, you know,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.100]   there were financial institutions that were refusing
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.060]   to let him, you know, park his money there.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.220]   So I mean, it really does get pretty terrifying
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.220]   pretty quickly.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.700]   - Probably without any transparency from those companies.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.500]   So you're right, it feels like there should be a process
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.180]   of just having, for him to defend himself.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.820]   - I think there needs to be a process
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.440]   for people to defend themselves.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.940]   Every day I wake up and I go,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.460]   is something I said in a video
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.860]   gonna get taken out of context?
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.020]   Is somebody gonna get angry?
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.860]   Is somebody gonna be, you know, I say wild stuff
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.260]   because that's what makes me laugh.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.340]   That's what makes my friends laugh,
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.220]   and that's what makes my audience laugh.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.140]   So I never ever, people, you know,
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.460]   whatever political side you come down on,
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.700]   I think if you make your living speaking,
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.460]   it's always interesting to me
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.780]   if you are pro the deplatforming.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.380]   - It's interesting-- - That's odd.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.740]   - It's interesting to consider kind of a jury context
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.140]   to where, you know, there's transparency
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.580]   about why your video about bombing Disney World
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.620]   might be taken down.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.380]   It gets taken down, and then there is,
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.980]   it's almost like creating a little court case,
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.220]   a mini court case, and not in a legal sense,
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.420]   but in the public sphere.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.700]   And then people should be able to have,
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.580]   you know, you pick representatives of our current society
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.780]   and have a discussion about that and make a real vote.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.580]   You know, just have like jury locks himself up
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.740]   in a discussion.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.100]   That kind of process might be necessary.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.720]   Right now what happens is Twitter is completely,
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.540]   first of all, they're just mostly not aware
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.780]   of everything they're doing.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.980]   There's too much stuff, but the stuff they're aware about,
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.660]   they make the decision and close doors,
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.380]   the meetings, and without any transparency
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.860]   to the rest of the company, actually,
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.500]   but also transparency to the rest of the world.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.940]   And so, and then all they say is we're making decisions
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.780]   because the people, they use things like violence.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.780]   So violence equals bad, and if this person
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.700]   is quote unquote inciting violence,
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.700]   therefore that gives us enough reason to ban them
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.020]   without any kind of process.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.240]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.800]   I'm torn in the whole thing.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.540]   If it was indeed, there's no transparency about it,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.000]   but if Parler was indeed inciting violence,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.260]   like if there was brewing of violence,
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.260]   potential violence where thousands of people might die
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.740]   because of some kind of riot,
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.340]   this is the scary thing about mob,
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.980]   about when a lot of people get together,
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:19.100]   who are good people, like legitimately good people
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.500]   that love this country, that don't see enemies yet
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.100]   around them, but if they get excited together
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.340]   and there's guns involved--
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.180]   - It's a problem.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.580]   - Some cop gets nervous and shoots one person,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.420]   another person shoots the cop,
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.260]   and then there's a lot of shooting involved,
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.140]   and then it goes from five people dying in the Capitol
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.020]   to thousands of people dying in the Capitol.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.500]   - Well, in fairness to defend the people of the Capitol,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.700]   they didn't shoot the cop, they bludgeoned him to death
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.580]   with a fire extinguisher.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.400]   - Yes.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.940]   - So I do wanna just kind of put that out
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.700]   as a defense of them.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.060]   Listen, I'm sure there was some wild shit
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.900]   going on on Parler, and I think the problem,
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.460]   here's the problem, right?
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.260]   There's a lot of people that just wanna go on these sites
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.420]   and say they wanna kill everyone.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:11.420]   And the problem is, at what point do you shut them all down?
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.460]   Like I think a lot of people are just living in a world
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.900]   where they're powerless, they don't have any political power,
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.700]   they don't have any economic power, right?
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.060]   They can't throw their money around.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:26.100]   They don't have healthcare, their job security isn't great.
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.660]   They might be living in a community
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.380]   that doesn't have the resources
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.420]   they would like it to have.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.060]   They're not happy and thrilled.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.060]   And then they have these sites where they can go on
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.740]   and just say, "Man, I'd like to fucking burn it all down."
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.740]   And distinguishing a guy blowing off steam
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.960]   and saying wild stuff from a genuine threat
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.820]   is a very hard thing to do.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:52.860]   Like I've threatened to kill, I got banned from Airbnb,
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   I threatened to kill the people that banned me comedically.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.540]   Comedically, this is a joke.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.140]   I'm not going to kill you.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.140]   This is a joke 'cause I'm blowing off steam and I'm angry.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.260]   Do you know how many people that my parents,
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.460]   like my dad's like, "I'm gonna fucking kill this guy."
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.580]   My mom's like, "I'm gonna fucking kill."
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.340]   They were talking about each other.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.380]   But none of it ever happened, but we should be,
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.540]   I think you have to create a space
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.180]   for people to threaten to overthrow the government
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.140]   as long as they don't violently do it.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.740]   Does that make any sense?
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.300]   I mean, as long as they're not gonna go hurt innocent people,
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   what are you gonna do?
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.940]   There's so many people out there that,
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.020]   that's why a lot of these things like 4chan, these sites,
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.160]   a lot of people going on there,
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.620]   they just wanna say the most fucked up shit
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.500]   because it's the thing that gives them,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.940]   they can laugh or they can release steam.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.980]   It is immature, it is stupid.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.260]   It's not productive, it's not,
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.980]   but at the end of the day,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.280]   if you're not gonna give people health insurance,
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.940]   you gotta give them something.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.020]   It's like when someone in this country dies
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.900]   that everyone disagrees with, right?
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.700]   Political figure, media figure.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.180]   A lot of people dance on their grave online
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.900]   and then everyone people goes,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.780]   and the other side will always do it.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.300]   Like if a conservative dies and everyone goes, "Great."
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.620]   Conservatives goes, "This is grotesque."
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.900]   And then when RBG dies, they all have parties
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.600]   and the conservatives go, "Great."
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.980]   You have to let people in this country
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.100]   enjoy the deaths of their enemies.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.180]   - Yeah. - You do,
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.620]   because they don't have much else.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.700]   Again, if you gave them other things,
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.780]   you might say, "Guy, you can go get a knee operation.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.980]   "Why don't you stop?"
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.460]   But if they're working for shit wages
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.620]   and you haven't figured out a way to treat them,
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.620]   treat their cancer diagnosis,
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.180]   and they don't, I mean life,
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:54.260]   you gotta derive pleasure from something, right?
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.900]   - It's an interesting point that anger is a good valve.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.800]   If your life is suffering,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.940]   that there's something very powerful about anger,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.700]   but I still have hope that it doesn't have to be.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.060]   I mean, that kind of channeling into anger
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.860]   that then becomes hate
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.820]   led us into a lot of troubles in human history.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.700]   So you have to be careful
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.060]   empowering people too much in that anger,
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.800]   especially, I think I understand
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.980]   why people were nervous about Parler,
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.700]   about Twitter and so on. - For sure, yeah.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.180]   - Because all that shit talking about violence
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.660]   was now paired with, "Let's get together at this location."
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.060]   - Right, right. - This was a new thing.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.180]   It's not just being on whatever platform talking shit,
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.940]   it's saying, "We're going to, in physical space, meet."
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.460]   And then everybody got, all these platforms got nervous.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.020]   Well, what happens when all these shit talkers,
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.740]   all these angry people that are just letting off steam
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.260]   meet in a physical space?
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.940]   And there was probably overreach,
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.240]   almost definitely overreach,
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.260]   but I can understand why they were nervous about it.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.100]   - I agree.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:08.920]   There doesn't seem to be,
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.140]   and this is when Trump got elected
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.940]   and when you have like, whatever you have, right?
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.580]   Whether you have riots in Portland and Seattle,
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.780]   where you have the Antifa people doing crazy things,
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.660]   you have like, the people storming the Capitol.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.020]   There never seems to be a ton of an examination
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.540]   of why these ideas are becoming popular.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.220]   Why are people so angry?
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.260]   What is leading people to this?
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.720]   Why are we here?
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.260]   What about their lives is to the point
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.860]   where they need to show up at these places?
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.780]   And like, and obviously,
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.300]   there's always gonna be people on the fringe.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.860]   There'll always be the mentally unwell.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.420]   There'll always be people that want to destroy society.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.460]   But when you look at how popular large,
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.340]   long discredited things,
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.060]   whether it's fascism, totalitarian communism,
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.260]   all of these things are like, why are they back?
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.780]   Why are they back in a big way?
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:58.620]   And why are people so fed up with the status quo
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.620]   that they're finding solace
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.500]   in the most extreme discredited theories
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.960]   of how to run and operate societies?
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.700]   Theories that have led to death of a lot of people.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.500]   So to me, I'm like, if those people at the Capitol,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.220]   yes, if they were going to work,
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.640]   if they were able to go out and drink at Chili's,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.260]   if they were able to get a fucking checkup, right?
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.020]   Like if their job paid a little bit better,
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.580]   and I'm not saying that this is all the reason, right?
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.060]   I'm sure that there's a lot of people there
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.620]   that are doing quite well, and they're still nuts.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.740]   But like the anger and the rage
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.160]   that's boiling to the surface of this society,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.160]   does it come from the fact that across the board
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.660]   people in very different areas
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.980]   and with very different political beliefs
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.540]   feel like they are being fucked over
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.500]   and there's nothing they can do about it.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.620]   That's what the baseline to me,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.060]   they look at the people that run the country
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.780]   and run the world, whether they're tech titans,
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.900]   the guys that you talk to,
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.780]   or whether they're people that run the government,
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.720]   whether they're people that run large banks,
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.420]   large media companies, the people that have created
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.700]   this kind of infrastructure that everyone lives in,
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.780]   these people are incredibly powerless.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.820]   And when you push people to that point,
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.020]   logically, sadly, and unfortunately,
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.580]   the next thing does seem to be violence.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.700]   - Yeah, the thing that troubles me a lot
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.660]   is you said nobody's asking why these beliefs are out there,
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.340]   but sometimes it's not even acknowledged
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:49.340]   that people are hurting, people are angry,
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.900]   just even acknowledging that all the conspiracy theories
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.540]   that are out there, acknowledging that they're out there.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.260]   And then people are thinking about it and talking about it
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.900]   just because otherwise,
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.260]   so it's not acknowledged in this nuanced way.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.980]   What happens is you say, okay,
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.660]   70 million people are white supremacists.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:12.180]   It's just throwing a kind of blanket statement.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:16.180]   And of course, that gets them angrier
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.700]   and makes them feel more powerless.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:24.700]   And that ultimately, that's what's been painful for me
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.300]   to see is that there's not an acknowledgement
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.980]   that most people are good.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.820]   - Right.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.980]   - There's circumstances where it's just, you're pissed off.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.820]   - Right.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.820]   - Because you are powerless.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.300]   - You could fall in with a bad crowd.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.420]   That's the thing, you can just fall in.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.180]   And it doesn't mean that there's not blame.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.720]   Obviously, you have agency, you're a person.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.060]   But the idea that you could be rehabilitated,
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.420]   you could do something stupid
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.500]   or you could fall into a group of people that are,
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.860]   and then in a few years, you could go,
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.100]   what the fuck was I doing?
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.100]   I'm an ex-drug addict.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.220]   I know what it's like to go from being one thing
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.920]   to being another thing, right?
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.820]   I'm still a drug addict.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.620]   If I were to use drugs right now or drink,
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.220]   I would still be addicted to them, right?
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.180]   I mean, it's not something
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.100]   that I can ever change about myself,
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:14.940]   but I know what it's like
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.380]   to go from one thing to another thing.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.980]   So when you look at racism or whatever-ism,
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.860]   homophobia, misogyny, whatever you're looking at,
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.100]   anti-Semitism, and you go, that's a fixed condition
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.540]   where nobody's ever going to be able to change.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.900]   Nobody's ever gonna be able to be rehabilitated.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.700]   Nobody's ever going to be able to reimagine themselves
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.880]   in a different way.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.980]   To me, you're just, you're throwing away someone
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.900]   and you're making them feel helpless and worthless,
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.060]   and that's gonna lead to antisocial behavior
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.020]   that spills out into violence.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.780]   We don't have a very redemptive society.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.580]   That's a huge factor.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.660]   We don't have a redemptive society.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.020]   That's why I like OJ Simpson, because OJ,
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.140]   yes, he did a bad thing, supposedly.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:58.980]   - Allegedly, yeah.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.300]   - But he's very kind now on Twitter,
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.060]   and he makes very nice points about how we all have
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.660]   to get involved in the political process,
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.940]   and he's on golf courses, and I like watching people golf.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.100]   I don't do it, but I like watching him do it.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.060]   And he's like an elder statesman,
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.900]   'cause I remember him from "The Naked Gun,"
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:18.900]   and I choose to forgive him for whatever happened there,
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:23.700]   which I don't know, but I choose to forgive him really for,
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.060]   I mean, obviously, what they say is he cut
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:30.060]   his wife's head off, but I can look past that
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:34.300]   and redeem him because he's very stable on Twitter,
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.620]   and he's a good, like I see all these people going crazy
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.300]   on Twitter, and I'm like, there's maybe,
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.620]   OJ's lived a full life, and I think there's a benefit
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.500]   to that, there's a benefit to kind of living a full life.
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.060]   - Yeah, how many of us have not at least tried
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:48.900]   to murder somebody in the past?
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.860]   - 100%, listen, OJ's had the highs and the lows,
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:57.820]   but he did it on his terms, and there's a real--
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.580]   - It's like a Frank Sinatra song.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.140]   - Yeah, he did it my way, I mean,
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.620]   there's a benefit to that, and he seems
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.180]   like a very well-adjusted person now,
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.500]   so I mean, I don't know, how is that a fact?
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.820]   But it is a fact, and that's an uncomfortable fact.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.100]   - Well, that's a strong case for forgiveness
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.260]   in one of the more extreme cases, I suppose.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.860]   But yeah, there's not a process of forgiveness.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.300]   It seems like people just take a single event from your,
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.940]   sometimes a single statement from your past,
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.940]   and use that as a categorical capture
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.900]   of the essence of this particular human being.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:36.180]   So murder might be a thing that you should get
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.180]   a timeout for, a little--
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.620]   - Murder's bad, murder, and let's just say that.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.140]   Murder is not good.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.580]   - Now, I'm glad you make this definitive statement.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.180]   It's a controversial-- - OJ's an interesting cat,
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.300]   because you're like, he's very stable on Twitter.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.900]   He's very like, he's like, "Let's take a look at it, guys."
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.340]   Like, we need more of his energy,
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.620]   that's what I'm trying to say.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.980]   - Yeah, yeah. - I know, like, yes,
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.020]   it was bad, he killed the woman in the waiter.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.620]   I was not for that.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.380]   I wish he didn't do that, but the OJ Simpson trial
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.740]   was such a fun thing. - Yeah, and like you said,
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.140]   we need more fun people in society.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:15.060]   - Well, you might. - Speaking of fun people,
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.660]   your politics have been all over the place.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.860]   - I hope so, I hope so.
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.580]   I mean, imagine not, imagine someone whose politics
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.060]   weren't all over the place, it would seem odd.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.460]   - Right, like-- - In the 10 years
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.780]   that I've been politically conscious,
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.460]   just 'cause I'm 35, no, I've probably been conscious
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.140]   for over two decades, but like,
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.620]   Democrats have become Republicans,
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.580]   Republicans become Democrats.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.660]   I remember when Ann Coulter said we need to,
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.060]   defended George W. Bush when he said,
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.820]   "We need to go out and Christianize,
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.020]   "or modernize the Arab world,
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.820]   "and we need to democratize the Arab world."
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.500]   And then Ann Coulter backed Donald Trump,
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.540]   and all the right wing in America
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.980]   believed in nation building.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.180]   They believed in going out and democratizing areas
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.620]   that might breed radical terrorists,
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.100]   whether it was Iraq or wherever you were going,
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:05.220]   toppling regimes and instituting new democratic norms
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.060]   in those countries.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.780]   That was the right wing point of view when I grew up.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.100]   Then the right wing switched to,
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.220]   we are going to be isolationist,
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.140]   we're gonna take care of America,
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.260]   first and foremost,
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.220]   we're not gonna go into other countries.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.140]   And then the Democrats, who when I grew up were doves,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.940]   and the right wing people were more hawkish,
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.780]   and the Democrats were like,
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.660]   the military solutions aren't the way.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.700]   We need to have multilateral diplomatic coalitions
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.260]   to solve all the problems.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.940]   Now, you know, Rachel Maddow's like,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.380]   "Let's nuke Russia every night on MSNBC."
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.420]   The Democrats are like,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.900]   "We need strong presence in Syria,
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.340]   "we need a strong presence,
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.620]   "we need to counter Putin all over the globe,
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.460]   "we need to get,"
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.100]   so they're more hawkish on things.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.420]   So literally, I have watched two political parties
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.940]   literally flip, and it's crazy to watch.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.140]   - And in some sense, I've watched that as well,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.140]   because when I first saw Barack Obama,
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.460]   I admired that he was against the war.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:07.620]   This is whatever, maybe before he was a senator,
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.820]   he spoke out against the Iraq war.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.660]   - Right.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.860]   - And then, you know,
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.420]   it doesn't feel like,
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.300]   it feels like his administration was more hawkish
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.260]   than dovish, in a sense,
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.740]   with all the drone attacks,
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.300]   with the sort of inability to pull back,
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.620]   or at least, en masse,
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.580]   efficiently pull back from all the military involvement
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.340]   that we have all over the world,
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.420]   and just the language.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.860]   - What I think is interesting about that,
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.900]   what's interesting about Obama,
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.580]   'cause this is a very interesting study,
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.980]   is that presidents are controlled
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.460]   in very different ways, right?
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.500]   You know, presidents can be controlled
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.100]   by different factors, power factions,
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.980]   within Washington.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.460]   You know, I think one of the reasons
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.460]   that Obama was maybe,
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.780]   you know, he had a very close relationship
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.060]   with John Brennan, who was a CIA director.
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.500]   And Obama was very close with John Brennan,
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.900]   and Obama was very, you know,
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.300]   you know, I think, malleable,
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.060]   to the extent that, you know, the CIA,
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.780]   and I've had CIA agents on my show,
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.660]   John Kiriakou, a guy who went to jail
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.900]   for exposing torture, was saying that,
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.180]   like, you know, you get into the Oval Office,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.020]   all of a sudden, you're having
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.900]   the presidential daily briefing every day,
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.060]   and the intelligence people come in,
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.460]   and they go, "Listen, man, I mean,
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.260]   "there's gonna be a terrorist attack on your watch
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.940]   "if you don't do X, Y, and Z."
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.180]   They go, "We have," you know,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.980]   they call it like blue book information,
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.740]   which is five levels above top secret,
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:35.480]   and they go like, "Hey, man, a guy in Iran at a cafe
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.020]   "said he's blowing everything up next week."
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.460]   You know, I mean, it's the same thing as parlor.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.980]   You don't know if it's true or not,
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.620]   but now the president's making decision
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.940]   on usually a lot of uncorroborated intelligence
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.180]   that goes into a presentation for the president,
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.540]   where you're just terrified every day,
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.580]   and you don't want a terrorist attack on your watch.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.740]   Now, so why are they getting all this information?
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.660]   Because a lot of the people in Washington
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:00.100]   have an interest in perpetual, constant, ongoing warfare,
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.720]   and there's a lot of financial gain to be had from that,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.420]   so they're sneaking their information
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.260]   into the presentations that are going to the president,
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.140]   and then the president is now behaving and going,
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.620]   "Fuck, I don't want a bomb going off.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.420]   "We gotta do what we gotta do."
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:16.640]   And whatever version of that happens,
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.580]   that is really kind of what is happening,
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.960]   whereas the presidents are being controlled
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.620]   by forces that are outside of the political sphere,
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.900]   but very much still in it, and they have a lot of,
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.020]   that's what the deep state is.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.220]   You know, Trump, there's a lot of ridiculing Trump
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.460]   of going, "The deep state doesn't exist."
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.420]   But it absolutely exists.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.820]   There's been books about it written by liberal journalists.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:41.820]   The deep state is only a term for unelected, largely,
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.900]   power factions in Washington, D.C.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.900]   that outlive any presidential administration.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.300]   These are people that might work at the State Department,
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.700]   they might work at the Defense Department.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:56.380]   These are people that are not always working officially
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.940]   in any government capacity.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.060]   They might be private companies,
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.860]   they might be military contractors,
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.980]   they might be people at Boeing or Raytheon
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:09.980]   or General Dynamics, and they constitute a group of people
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.980]   that Trump kind of called the swamp,
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.140]   but Trump had really no interest in draining the swamp.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:18.760]   But he articulated these things, and this is what it is.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.060]   You have a lot of interested parties
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:24.660]   that have budgets that they want, big budgets.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.380]   Everybody wants a budget in Washington,
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.340]   whether you know what it is, they want money.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.740]   And these are the people who really control.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.140]   So this idea that the president is the be-all, end-all
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.380]   has gotta be smashed, which is why
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.540]   the horse race model of politics and being like,
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.380]   is it right wing, is it left wing,
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.580]   is it what team am I on and what color am I wearing?
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:47.260]   It's very simplistic, but the reality is this is an empire.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.060]   It's past its peak, we're in trouble.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.940]   - The United States is an empire past its peak.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.460]   - Yeah, I mean, that's just,
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:56.020]   you could prove that case in court.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.500]   - Well, let's go to court right now,
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.380]   but I do love the more complex idea
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.620]   that there's just human beings who crave power
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:08.140]   and seek ways to attain that power through different ways.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:13.060]   If you have Barack Obama or George Bush or Donald Trump,
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.740]   there's different attack vectors,
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.660]   different ways to attain that power,
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.940]   and then you can use that to leverage.
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.460]   It probably doesn't have to be just in Washington, D.C.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.540]   There's people who crave power all over the world.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.340]   - Of course, but where we are now in Los Angeles,
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.700]   these people are all good.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.740]   - LA. - Studio executives
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.660]   and people that, from what I understand,
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:38.620]   they treat everyone fairly and they're nice.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.580]   But D.C.'s the bad guys, but out here in LA.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.660]   - West Coast. - Everyone's lovely.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:48.660]   - So amidst this fun exploration in your mind
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.660]   through the political landscape that you've done
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.540]   over the past couple of decades,
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.500]   decade that you've been conscious politically,
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.580]   where does Donald Trump fit into this picture for you?
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.780]   Is-- - Great question.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.060]   Well, he didn't, right?
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.820]   'Cause he wasn't political until four years ago, right?
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.420]   He got political very quickly before.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.060]   I mean, he was firing off crazy tweets
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.060]   about where Obama was born or whatever,
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.900]   but he got into politics very quickly,
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.220]   and then he became the president, right?
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.060]   So it was like, I knew him as Donald Trump,
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.780]   this crazy New York City character,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.980]   the host of "The Apprentice."
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.420]   I didn't think much about him.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.780]   He was just constant.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.660]   He was just this constant figure.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.140]   I don't think much about Warren Buffett.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.900]   I know Trump's like, he's married
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.660]   to a new showgirl all the time,
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.460]   and he's always opening another casino,
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.660]   and he's on TV. - Wait, Warren Buffett?
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.700]   Really? - No, Trump.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.540]   Trump. - Oh, Trump, okay.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.940]   - But Warren Buffett is the opposite, right?
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.460]   Warren Buffett's been married for a million years,
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.660]   lives in a little house in Omaha.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.500]   But that's what I associate Trump.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.180]   I don't think about Warren Buffett.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.580]   I don't think about these people.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.660]   They're just guys that I've known forever
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.940]   that have like, you know,
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.540]   you associate certain things with them, right?
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.780]   And Trump, we always associated with kind of vulgar,
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.300]   garish, new money, billionaire, married a lot,
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.780]   you know, casinos, Miss Universe pageants.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.660]   But again, you know, but it makes perfect sense
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.660]   that he really was able to become president at the moment
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.540]   where we were about to have Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:25.020]   And I think Americans felt like this is now
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.540]   the oligarchy is spinning right in our face.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.540]   You're not even making it feel like
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.500]   there's an appearance of democracy.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.220]   We have two crime families
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.060]   vowing for control of the country every four years.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.460]   And then there was this rogue kind of upstart guy
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.300]   that was really about himself.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.420]   You know, Trump doesn't really care that much about the,
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.660]   I mean, really was summarized perfectly when he left
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.660]   and he just said, "Hey, have a good life."
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.060]   That's what he said before he got on Andrews Air Force Base.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.700]   If you watch his speech, he goes, "Hey, have a good life."
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.820]   That's what he really feel like,
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.300]   "Hey, have a good life.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.540]   "I'm gonna get on a plane right now
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.460]   "and fly to a castle I own in Florida.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.900]   "And really, I'm not gonna think too much about you people
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.340]   "outside of how I can get more attention in the future."
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.100]   - Can I ask you like a therapy question?
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:14.940]   - Yes.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.700]   - What is your favorite
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.760]   and least favorite quality of Donald Trump?
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.940]   - So my least favorite quality of Donald Trump,
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.820]   I think, because there's a few of them,
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.420]   his lack of empathy,
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.180]   complete and total lack of empathy.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.180]   I don't feel that he cares about human beings on any level.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.740]   And I feel like that's maybe or should be a requirement.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.580]   Right?
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.180]   I mean, I don't think he cares.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.500]   I think it's obvious that he doesn't care.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.220]   I mean, he said, you know, basically he's saying like,
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.620]   "They're in there, Mike Pence is in there.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.940]   "He knows that his people are going to try
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.780]   "to get into a Capitol.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.740]   "I mean, those motherfuckers are not gonna have jobs.
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.660]   "They're gonna go to federal prison."
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.140]   And he doesn't care.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:00.980]   - He doesn't care.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.220]   - As long as they're storming the Capitol
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.740]   to prove the point that he thinks he won the election,
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.980]   he has no concern for these people, his followers.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.280]   He leads them lambs to the slaughter, right?
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.660]   So that's not a respectable quality.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.100]   My favorite quality of Donald Trump
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.620]   is his willingness to call bullshit.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.220]   So his willingness to call bullshit out.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.420]   He doesn't play the game.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.460]   He will, you know, when people say about Putin,
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.460]   Putin kills people, he goes,
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.780]   "We kill a lot of people here too."
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:31.340]   Like he's willing and able to break the fourth wall
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.420]   and say things that no politician has ever said.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.820]   He's willing to call out hypocrisy, you know,
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.140]   of course not his own, but the media,
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.820]   the members of the political establishment,
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.220]   that's a laudable quality.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.360]   It's an entertaining quality, right?
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.300]   We all like it.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.100]   I love to, I'm like, "This guy's saying something
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.860]   "that a lot of people want said."
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.860]   - Yeah.
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:53.820]   - That being said, it's coupled with no real work or action.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.660]   - Right.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.540]   - So it's not coupled with anything behind it
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.440]   that he just wants to,
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.820]   we did an episode of my podcast once
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.220]   where it's like essentially he's like criticizing
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.420]   the deep state, he wants a deeper state.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.460]   He wants a deeper state,
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.940]   like he hired his daughter and her husband.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.620]   I mean, this is not a guy that's interested
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.460]   in transparency and openness.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.900]   He's a guy that would just prefer,
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.740]   he wants to run the mafia state.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.820]   - But he shakes up the norms of social discourse,
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.980]   political discourse. - Yes.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.260]   - And that people are just hungry for that.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.100]   - Yes.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.980]   - But he got banned from Twitter.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.840]   - He did. - From all the different
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.120]   platforms.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.620]   Do you think, is there an argument to be made
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.460]   for and against banning Twitter?
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.720]   - There's always arguments to be made for everything.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.220]   A permanent ban seems to be an overreaction to me.
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.740]   He's the president of the United States.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.220]   It also rearranges the power,
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.460]   like whether you like him or hate him,
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.540]   love him or hate him, he was the president.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.700]   We've elevated Twitter as now more powerful
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.820]   than the president.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.740]   It's like, do you want that to be long-term,
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.080]   the salute, the reality?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.860]   Like now Jack at Twitter is more powerful
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.540]   than the president of the United States.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.100]   Is that a good paradigm going forward?
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.460]   I don't know.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.620]   I'm not, listen, maybe give him a little time out
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.060]   for a few days.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.360]   I think a time out, a little spanking, certainly,
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.860]   but I don't know if a permanent ban across the board
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.260]   on every social media, I mean, they banned him on Grindr.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.900]   I mean, this is how hilarious it is, right?
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.580]   I mean, they banned him across the board on everything.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.780]   I don't think he could get an Airbnb now, neither can I,
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.820]   but like, I don't think he can do anything.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.340]   Again, I just, I look back and there's so many people,
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.740]   I have very smart, intelligent friends that go,
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.660]   yeah, but who cares?
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.740]   Yeah, but he's bad.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.740]   Yeah, but blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.340]   Yeah, but I don't like me, Lillianopolis.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.780]   Yeah, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.260]   And I'm like, you have such faith.
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:39.040]   You have such faith that it's always gonna be the people
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.540]   you dislike that are banned.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.100]   It's always gonna be the, it's never gonna be you.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.320]   Man, you have so much faith in the government.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.180]   You have so much faith in tech oligarchs you've never met.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.460]   You have so much faith in the security state
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.720]   that they're gonna always make the right decisions
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.580]   and they're not gonna penalize people
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.860]   that shouldn't be penalized.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.420]   To me, I'm like, wow, I've never had that much faith
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.220]   in any human being ever, including myself.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.660]   I wouldn't want that power.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.980]   I would start deplatforming people that I hate.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.420]   I would deplatform my aunt, you know what I mean?
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.620]   I would deplatform everyone I know.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:14.140]   I mean, so it's such an insane power to give somebody,
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.220]   like who gets heard?
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.820]   Who gets to speak?
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.900]   - Yeah, I'm worried about the effect it has on people
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.060]   like you, actually.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:20.900]   - I agree.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.500]   - Of being, like everybody's a little more nervous
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.460]   in what they say.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.300]   - Correct.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.460]   - And that, that's a big problem.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.300]   - Yes.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.820]   - Because then you're just like long-term unmasked,
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.740]   like we were talking about.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.620]   It has an effect where people just become more bland.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.320]   - Yeah, self-censorship.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.320]   - Anxiety, all of these things go into it.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.160]   We try to fight it.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.000]   I try to fight it.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.120]   I think I gotta still do what makes me laugh
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.480]   and what makes me laugh is often fucked up.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.360]   And it's often, you know, it's not always fucked up
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.560]   in a way that, you know, it's gonna get me
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.080]   thrown off something, but like,
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.400]   I think pushing certain buttons is funny to me.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.320]   So I gotta keep doing that.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.920]   Part of the problem is that so many of the lines are blurred.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.800]   Right, so you have comedians that are commentators
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.400]   and commentators that are comedians and politicians.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.160]   So it's like, it's harder to the defense of like,
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.800]   hey, I'm a comedian, leave me alone.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.320]   That defense becomes harder when like
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.840]   all of these lines are blurring.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.160]   Everybody's kind of everything now.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.200]   So like people say to me, you should run for office
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.020]   and they're serious.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.640]   And I'm like, you're crazy, but they're serious.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.720]   Like, so the blurring of everything means
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.240]   that people aren't in their lanes as much
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.960]   and that you go, well, this guy is dangerous
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.640]   because he's not just making a joke.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.000]   He's doing something else and he's using humor.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:38.960]   And I'm like, I'm really not.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.320]   I'm really just trying to make a joke.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.120]   That's all, that's really what I'm trying to do.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.000]   But I do think that because of the flattening,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.160]   there's a lot of people out there that go,
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.920]   they take aim at humor because they go,
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.360]   humor is where bad ideas can kind of,
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.080]   you know, start and flourish.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.680]   - But don't you, to put some responsibility on you.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.520]   - Yeah.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.140]   - Don't you think humor is a way to,
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.360]   that you are the modern,
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.920]   like Jordan Peterson style intellectual.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.040]   That humor is actually a tool of changing the zeitgeist,
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.880]   changing the social norms.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.920]   - It absolutely can be, but it also cannot be.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.400]   I don't think it's any one thing.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.560]   And I think there's a lot of pressure for a comedian.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.960]   You can be funny and right.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.080]   You can be funny and wrong.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.880]   If your goal is to be right,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.620]   you might end up being right and not funny.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.840]   So the reality is funny has to come first.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.160]   There are brilliant people that have been funny
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.240]   and correct according to people, right?
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.040]   But at the end of the day,
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.360]   people that put way too much faith in what comedy is,
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.720]   most of what comedy is,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.560]   is people showing up to strip malls
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.800]   and telling jokes for an hour
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.160]   while people eat chicken fingers
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.620]   and they all get drunk and they laugh
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.800]   and they feel a little bit better about their lives.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.520]   That's really the majority of comedy.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.240]   Then there's like 10 famous people that are really famous
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.760]   that do a version of that in an arena.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.720]   But the amount of cultural power they have
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.640]   has always been greatly exaggerated.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.440]   My uncles loved George Carlin,
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.760]   who was anti-military industrial complex,
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.200]   anti this, anti that.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.040]   And then they would go vote for Ronald Reagan.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:07.880]   They didn't care.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.800]   It doesn't really, it's not as powerful as you think.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.960]   I wish it was.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.260]   It feels good.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.440]   It feels good for me to say, I am the new thing.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.840]   It really isn't.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.680]   It truly isn't.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.040]   No one is, comedians are the people that get on stage
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.400]   and say, we're fucked up.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.200]   We're drug addicts.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.080]   We're sex addicts.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.120]   We're fat.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:28.960]   We're gross.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.920]   We can't manage our money.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.160]   We can't stop eating.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.120]   We can't stop fucking doing horrible things.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:33.960]   We're liars.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.800]   We're narcissists.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.640]   We're scumbags.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.480]   We're the people that get out and say that.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.240]   Only a psychopath would look at us and go, show me the way.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.680]   Like it's not.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.520]   I disagree with you.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.880]   'Cause then I'm a psychopath.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.680]   Well, and that's, I mean, I don't think,
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.520]   no pushback here.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.760]   That's another issue.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.600]   But you know what I'm saying.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.040]   Well, I don't because, I mean,
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.080]   I understand you using this as a psychological tool
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.640]   for yourself to give yourself freedom.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.840]   But the reality is you are one of the rare comedians
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.280]   like a George Carlin who is, besides being funny.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.120]   Yeah, when I hear things like that, I'm like, okay,
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.960]   you're being very sweet.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.080]   But like, I agree.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:14.920]   I understand what you're saying.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.240]   I do stuff that makes, hopefully makes you think.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.880]   I hope that's what good comedy is.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.080]   But I think I try to do that.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:25.880]   But I also would hate to feel shackled to the idea
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.480]   of that I had to make a point
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.360]   and that point had to be correct.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.600]   I think the best comedy makes fun of everything.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.800]   It makes fun of both sides.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.240]   And then there's a deeper truth about humanity revealed.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.520]   But then what happens is people take that deeper truth
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.080]   and go, let's politicize it.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.120]   But what does he mean?
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.200]   Is it the right or the left?
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.480]   And I'm like, I'm doing something that I think speaks
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.160]   to hopefully people on both sides for everybody.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.120]   'Cause I'm making fun of people on the left and the right
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.640]   and in the center and people that don't care
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.520]   and people that do care.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.560]   And I'm trying to figure out a way to do it.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.400]   But then immediately anything of value
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.720]   in this culture right now is like, how do we politicize it?
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.000]   How do we put it in a box?
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.960]   So yes, I think comedy could produce a lot
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.280]   of inherently valuable things, reflective, thoughtful things
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.480]   but then immediately can it be put in this box
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.040]   where all of those things can be used politically?
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.120]   No.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.960]   And like when they say like comedy is a great way
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.160]   to speak truth to power.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   It is, but I don't know how much it changes things.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.560]   I don't know how much a joke can dethrone a king.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.840]   I know the idea is nice
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.400]   but let's look at the practical applications.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   I mean, we had brilliant comics, Bill Hicks, George Carlin
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.800]   Richard Price, we had people talk
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.320]   about so many problems in society, illustrate them
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.840]   put a spotlight on them and we still have them.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.640]   They're worse now than they've ever been.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.480]   That's not true.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.680]   I think the society is better.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.200]   And so to push back in my perspective
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.200]   it's very possible that those voices were the exact reason
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.960]   we have the world today, which I do believe is actually
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:07.160]   I mean, on the boring old measures
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.680]   of what makes a good world, which is, you know
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.600]   the amount of violence in the world, the amount
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.640]   of opportunity, all those kinds of measures, even happiness
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.120]   all of those things measured things have been improving.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.480]   Steven Pinker gets a lot of shit for this
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.640]   but he's really good at articulating how the data says
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.800]   pretty clearly that the world is getting better.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.040]   And it's arguable that the freedoms we do enjoy currently
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.760]   are thanks to the comedic voices or the people who mock.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.240]   So to me, it's possible that humor is the very thing
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.480]   that saves the world.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.560]   Humor is the very thing that keeps
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.040]   is the balance of power in the world.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.360]   - But I think a lot of the things that those guys criticize
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.960]   whether it was militarism or the elites, the lying
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.600]   the corruption, the bribery, that's still going on.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.720]   And it's always gonna go on, right?
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.320]   Because that's the nature of human beings.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.640]   We call it out, we point it out
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.000]   but we don't have a plan to change.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.680]   It's not really our job.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.800]   And I think that too much now is like, well
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.600]   comedians should have a, like
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.560]   I don't tell people who to vote for.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.920]   Like the idea that comedians went
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.200]   and told people who to vote for is like, to me, it's crazy.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.560]   I understand like people have strong opinions
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.920]   but like, I believe I have a job
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.920]   and my job is to make you laugh or whatever
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.200]   maybe make you think, but like my job is not
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.120]   to tell you who to vote for.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.200]   I mean, it's absurd.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.800]   - But see the thing you do by the comedy
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.360]   like on your Twitter that people should definitely follow.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.760]   - I believe that, @jimjdylan, I agree with you.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.840]   - Oh, on this point of--
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.080]   - I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.560]   - That people should follow you.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.560]   Yeah, you give me freedom to think on my own.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.440]   Meaning like you're shaking things up to where I'm
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.560]   I don't feel constrained about what I can think about.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.480]   And that-- - That's awesome.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.440]   - That-- - Thank you.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.240]   - So you're not telling me what to think.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.520]   You're giving me the freedom to think.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.120]   And that's what great comedy does is, you know,
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.120]   I don't often agree with George Carlin.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.680]   He can get pretty political sometimes, but you know
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.240]   just the ability to do that, so rare.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.680]   Podcasts do that too now.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   Like there's certain people that can really
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.920]   just challenge you to, even when you disagree with them
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.480]   to sort of be like, oh, it's okay to think
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.680]   about this kind of stuff.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.880]   - Yeah, and I appreciate that 'cause that's awesome.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.080]   And I mean, that's great.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.240]   And to a guy like you, who's a brilliant guy, that's great.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.080]   If I'm giving you the license to think,
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.600]   then man, the world is completely fucked.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.720]   But I'm happy about that.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:32.560]   - Yeah.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.800]   (laughing)
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.560]   Speaking about the world being completely fucked,
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.360]   Alex Jones turned on QAnon.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.480]   I know almost nothing-- - It's a very tough, Matt.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.680]   They had a rough marriage.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.480]   They fought it out for years.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.600]   And eventually we just knew someone
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.520]   was gonna leave someone.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.800]   Q tried to leave him a few months ago.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.640]   - Oh, so--
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.520]   - Yeah, Q was staying at someone else's house.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.080]   The car wasn't in the driveway.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.720]   Yeah, well, the thing about QAnon that makes it a lot of fun
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.440]   is it's kind of a make it up as you go along.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.040]   I'm a drug addict, right?
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.120]   So often my lies aren't planned.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.040]   They're in the moment.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.200]   A lot of what I do on the podcast,
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.360]   a lot, you know, it's all in the moment.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.560]   I'll have an idea of what I wanna talk about,
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.800]   and I rant, and I go.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.520]   And I've been like stoned, and I show up at home,
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.680]   and my parents are like, "What's going on?
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.080]   "There was $50 on the mantel.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.520]   "Now it's not there."
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.000]   And I'm like, "Well,"
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.720]   and I gotta make something up on the spot, right?
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.000]   I've been, you know, "Are you drinking again?"
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.360]   "No, I'm not."
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.560]   And then you gotta have a,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.760]   "Well, you were gone for two days.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.720]   "No one knows where you were,
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.920]   "and somebody said you left your car."
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.600]   "Well, I was at a sales conference,
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.520]   "and I left my car.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.480]   "I flew to Phoenix."
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.120]   Like, I understand what that is.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.760]   QAnon is an ever-evolving conspiracy theory
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.480]   where the events are happening in the past,
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.680]   in the present, and in the future.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.560]   It's kind of hilarious.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.360]   Every conspiracy theory is like Kennedy,
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.200]   something like that,
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.320]   that there's a lot of truth in that, or all truth.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320]   But at the end of the day,
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.360]   it's like you're looking back from 30,000 feet,
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.440]   analyzing little things that have already happened.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.840]   QAnon's like, so I think Alex is kind of like
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.760]   a little tired of the constant evolving nature
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.080]   of that conspiracy theory.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.200]   - So he's not a fan of like the jazz
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.760]   that is QAnon, so they're not,
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.600]   because they're improvising constantly.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.720]   - Correct, they're improvising.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.280]   Alex is like, "Hey, man, I was on board a little bit,
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.060]   "but at the end of the day, it's getting a little annoying
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.600]   "because it can turn on you.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.080]   "Eventually, you become part of the conspiracy."
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.560]   Alex is controlled opposition.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.800]   That's what they'll say.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.520]   Eventually, you, because QAnon just eats things.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.320]   So it's a conspiracy that just eats things.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.720]   The minute you start to say, "Hey, man, maybe that's not,"
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.200]   it just eats you and go, "Well, you're in on it."
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.040]   Everyone's in on it.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.920]   Everyone's a satanic pedophile, everybody.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.640]   Everyone that questions it is eating children.
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.920]   And you go, "Wait a minute, that seems illogical."
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.280]   But now there's not enough. - There's not enough children.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.600]   - Now there's not enough.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.200]   And I think QAnon's over now, unfortunately,
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.000]   because for these people, but I think fortunately for them,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.520]   they're gonna have to find a new hobby.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.440]   But I think it's over now
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.840]   because even the best QAnon people now are starting to go,
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.280]   "Hey, man, this might not be going down
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.760]   "the way we thought."
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.400]   But they've literally gone as far as to say
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.880]   that Biden and Trump switched faces.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.600]   Trump's actually still the president except Biden's.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.880]   You have to be a real moron now.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.200]   You gotta be real stupid now.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.720]   It's at the end.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.640]   It was cool when the Epstein stuff happened,
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.880]   QAnon was like, "It was party at Q."
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.720]   And then when the Hunter Biden laptop stuff
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.440]   started to happen, they were like, "Dancing, it's time."
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:33.440]   And then Biden wins and they're like, "Wait, whoa."
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.640]   And it's just like, it's the day after the party.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.120]   QAnon, if you ever went to a party
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.240]   in high school or college,
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.840]   QAnon right now is the day after the party.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.560]   You wake up, it's 12 noon,
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.240]   the sun is hitting you in the face, you're hungover,
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.160]   there's a stench of disgusting beer
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.480]   and cigarettes all over the house.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.840]   You're like, "What the fuck happened here?
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.680]   "I gotta get out of here and get a bacon, egg and cheese."
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.120]   That's what QAnon is.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.080]   They gotta sober up, get out of that house,
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.120]   get a bacon, egg and cheese and go,
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.800]   "Man, we were fucking whacked.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.060]   "We were high, dude.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.160]   "I thought Nancy Pelosi was eating children for four years
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.340]   "and that Donald Trump was gonna put her in Guantanamo Bay.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:11.120]   "Wow, that was..."
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.080]   'Cause I mean, it's interesting.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.040]   The people that do that after the '60s,
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.920]   they were like, "Yeah, I just did a bunch of acid
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.340]   "and I lived in a ranch in Malibu
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:20.000]   "and fucked everyone I ever saw."
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.460]   And they're like, "I thought that was the way
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.380]   "the world was gonna go.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.960]   "And I followed some shaman guy,
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.600]   "some guru who just wanted to fuck me
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.700]   "and 10 other people that were living there.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.480]   "And we did that for three years.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.380]   "Apparently we never created the utopia
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.560]   "we thought we were gonna have.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.200]   "And now I'm back working here at Allstate Insurance
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.940]   "and we have great policies
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.440]   "and we'd love you to come in the office
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.100]   "so we can break them down for you."
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.540]   It all ends, folks.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.740]   All the love, all the bullshit ends, but it's fun.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.980]   They had so much fun.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.840]   QAnon was hard to get mad at because they were,
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.380]   this was all they had.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.600]   - Yeah.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.660]   - This was fun.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.800]   - They were quite good at it.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.780]   - And they were good at it.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.660]   And it was a lot of desperate people,
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.820]   but they were also rich idiots.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:04.620]   There's also like dumb, rich people.
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.140]   And those are like the saddest people
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.200]   in Q because it's like they should,
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.440]   they have the resources to do other things,
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.080]   but they just love Q.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.920]   They're like, "I'm just into this."
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.300]   And I'm like, "You're rich.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.540]   "Go do something.
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.180]   "How incurious are you?
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.920]   "Go to the Amazon.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.120]   "Go birdwatch."
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.040]   I don't know, but they're, so.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:25.880]   - Play golf.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.960]   - It's sad, but they're like done now.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.160]   I mean, it's over.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.000]   - Oh, so you think this is the--
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.160]   - I think everything's ending.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.720]   My whole thing is that Trump's out, QAnon's over,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.960]   the quarantine's gonna end,
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.900]   everything's gonna go back to something
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.580]   that's more recognizable.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.220]   I think that--
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.840]   - Are you optimistic about the 2021 and what--
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.500]   - To a degree, in certain aspects,
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.260]   I have optimism and then I have,
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.740]   I have short-term optimism and long-term pessimism.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.220]   Meaning that I think in the short-term,
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:55.280]   things can get better.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.500]   I think long-term, because there's so many forces
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.680]   that are out of our control,
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.020]   that are evolving in ways I barely understand,
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.900]   that are carving up society,
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.780]   it's gonna be very tough long-term
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.100]   to be completely optimistic,
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.080]   like hey, it's gonna be great,
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.440]   it's gonna be good forever.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.040]   But short-term, I think yeah, this quarantine will end,
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:12.880]   things will get better,
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.640]   the economy will get a little better,
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   the constant Trump craziness will die down a little bit.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.400]   That's my hope, and people can go back
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.240]   to focusing on things that matter,
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.080]   which is the things that are near you and close to you.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.280]   - Yeah, the humans around you.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.520]   - Humans around you, not Nancy Pelosi.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.320]   I have uncles that talk about Nancy Pelosi.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.840]   I'm like, you've never met her.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.740]   You'll never meet her, shut up.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.740]   - Yeah, and I have a belief that this kind of local love
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.940]   and kindness that you naturally can have
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:45.300]   for human beings that you actually know
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:49.300]   can be expanded at scale through the social networks
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.140]   that we use, that we build.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.540]   Twitter's currently failing at that miserably.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.380]   - That would be great.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.200]   - But that's--
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.700]   - If we were able to increase the love
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.880]   through the social networks, that would be great.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.580]   It feels very hard to.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.900]   - It's a worthy challenge.
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.100]   You've tweeted, "One of the underreported reasons
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.040]   "conspiracy theories take hold
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.900]   "is because some of them are true."
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:17.460]   What conspiracy theories do you believe
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:22.460]   that are sort of important for people to think about,
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.460]   would you say?
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:27.320]   - Kennedy was not killed by a lone gunman
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.260]   with no connections to any other situation, government.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.780]   I believe that JFK was removed from office
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:39.780]   by a group of people that had very different interests.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.220]   - But the question of deep state,
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:45.140]   so these are powerful people that are able now
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.720]   to dictate through basically the threat of violence
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.020]   what the presidents, the surface powerful people
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:53.860]   in our society.
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:57.380]   - Yeah, I mean, again, I want another investigation
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.800]   into 9/11, not because I think that George Bush
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.420]   pressed a button and made 9/11 happen,
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.700]   but because we invaded the country of Iraq,
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:08.700]   and then 15 out of 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.880]   There was tons of stuff in the 9/11 report
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.940]   that didn't make sense to anybody.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.660]   There's tons of stuff about that day
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.380]   that I feel like we just don't know.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.460]   - Yeah, that's, sorry to interrupt,
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:21.980]   that's when I, my little aunt life,
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.940]   touched upon conspiracy theory world
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.140]   and first learned about Alex Jones,
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.820]   is when 9/11 happened.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:31.540]   It was very frustrating to me how poorly
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:33.020]   the reporting and the transparency
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.000]   around what exactly happened, who knew what,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.500]   all that kind of basic information
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.420]   that you would hope the government would release,
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:45.940]   reveal, and use as like a lesson for how we prevent this.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.940]   Instead, it felt like a lot of stuff was being hidden
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.500]   in order to manipulate some kind of machine
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.820]   that leads us to war.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.700]   - Yeah, that's fair to say.
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.260]   Yeah, I mean, I just don't feel like
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.380]   we've gotten the full story.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.540]   I don't know what the full story is.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.340]   I can't, I don't know what it is,
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.980]   but I don't feel like we've gotten the full story.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.340]   Yeah, there are groups of powerful pedophiles, right?
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.500]   Whether they're in the Catholic church
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.020]   or they're in the government or wherever they are,
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.220]   they are able to cover things up that they do.
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.540]   They're able to silence people that try to out them
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:16.160]   in terms of like, you know, disrupt their operations.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.000]   That's true.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.660]   QAnon has nuggets of truth.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.180]   It just went crazy.
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.220]   Any conspiracy theory that involves the Knights Templar
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:27.260]   and also Chrissy Teigen is probably wrong.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.900]   - What's the Knights Templar?
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:32.100]   - Well, it was just this group of Knights back in the day.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.740]   You know, it's that, you know, supposedly secret meetings.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:36.820]   And like in every conspiracy, they talk about like,
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.860]   you know, if you go deep enough,
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:40.900]   it's like the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians,
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.860]   you know, all of these secret groups throughout history,
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.180]   the Illuminati, the-
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.780]   - Oh, and there's a thread that connects all of it.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.100]   - Oh, yeah, it connects it all to David Spade.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.580]   I mean, it's a little much.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.100]   - Well, how do you, if you're David Spade,
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.260]   defend yourself, by the way?
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.820]   - You ignore it because it's hilarious.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.740]   And I know David Spade.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.500]   It's like, Hollywood's kind of boring.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.900]   Yes, there are sex orgies.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:23:59.740]   I'm not invited.
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.940]   I'm sure there's shit going on.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:01.780]   Kids do get abused.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.860]   Women get abused.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:03.940]   - I'll invite you to one.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:04.780]   - Please.
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.620]   - If you want.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.540]   - We got the $75,000 dog and then we'll get one.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.940]   But you know, me and David Spade,
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:13.020]   we go out to sushi restaurants, like,
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.340]   and you sit there and you listen to people complain.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.940]   That's what a lot of it is.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:20.220]   What a lot of Hollywood is, is deeply sad tragedy
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.220]   that people don't understand.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.060]   And some of it is nefarious and dark
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.540]   and there are problems and there are real power brokers.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.220]   Here, it's a dark town, 100%.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.140]   But the idea that everybody that lives here
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:34.700]   is in some wide ranging, vast conspiracy isn't true.
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.580]   It ignores how humdrum, boring, deeply sad,
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.460]   most people's lives are in Hollywood.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.380]   And it ignores how sad fame is in general.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.060]   Fame's a sad thing.
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.300]   Not always, but a lot of times it's a sad thing.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.300]   It's fleeting, it's ephemeral, it doesn't last.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.500]   It separates you from other people.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.380]   It's isolating.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.780]   It can be traumatic, depending on what's going on.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.620]   Obviously, it's better than the alternative.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.020]   If you're trying to be famous,
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.340]   it's better to be famous than not famous, right?
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:06.540]   I'll say that.
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.260]   But it's a mixed bag to a degree.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.420]   There are things about it that aren't great.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.020]   And Hollywood has a deep undercurrent of sadness,
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.220]   of people that have not realized their dreams
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.380]   and people that have realized them.
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:21.180]   - Yeah, dark, right. - Both of those people--
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.020]   - The people that win Olympic gold medals
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.780]   can sometimes suffer from depression.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.180]   - Correct. - They've lost--
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.060]   - Well, somebody said, and I forget who said it,
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.700]   it's a great quote, it's not mine.
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.980]   I think it's from a book, or it might be from a TV show.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.380]   Sometimes I quote something and they're like,
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.980]   "That's from like Charlotte's Web."
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.580]   I'm like, oh.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.380]   The two worst things, oh, I think it's from the movie
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.220]   Limitless, I'm like an idiot.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.620]   But anyway, thanks for having me on.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:43.460]   Tomorrow, he's done some genius.
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.300]   - I will not publish this.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.500]   - It's from the movie, and I think he says,
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500]   "The two worst things in the world are knockout."
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.420]   Oh, you know it's not from Limitless?
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.900]   I think it's from the movie
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.020]   where Nicolas Cage sold weapons.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.300]   It was called Lord of War.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.500]   It's a little better than Limitless.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.580]   Anyway-- - That's a good movie.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.420]   - It's a great movie.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.900]   He said, "The two worst things in the world
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.380]   "are not getting what you want and getting it."
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.660]   So the undercurrents of sadness that run through Hollywood
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.740]   are there are two rivers that converge
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.540]   and there are people that just never had it
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.500]   and people that have it and go, "Now what?"
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.060]   And so it's a sad place, a tragic place,
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.860]   and there's a lot of, it's boring.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.460]   That's what people don't realize.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.820]   It's actually kind of boring.
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:21.940]   - Well, life is kind of boring.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:24.460]   - Life is kind of boring, but there's also like,
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.700]   so I think QAnon's this way to make a lot of it seem
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.460]   like it's super exciting.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.700]   And listen, I don't wanna diminish the experiences
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:31.540]   of people who've been abused
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.260]   'cause there is a lot of horror here,
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:34.700]   but the whole QAnon thing was like,
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.980]   everybody in everything is doing, and that's not true.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.580]   - Well, see, just to linger on that a little bit
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:44.380]   is Bill Gates, the conspiracy theories
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.220]   around Bill Gates bother me
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:50.940]   because this is me, dumb, naive Lex,
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.700]   thinks that Bill Gates did a lot of good for this world.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.580]   - Sure. - First, by creating a company
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.860]   that empowered personal computers,
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.500]   and second, by donating a ton of money
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.620]   for treating malaria in Africa
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.320]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.180]   And there's these huge amounts of conspiracies, I think,
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:15.180]   based on just replies to whenever Bill Gates does anything.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.700]   Like, to me, the top replies should be
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.460]   about how inspiring that guy is to donate so much money.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.780]   - Well, I think that-- - I'm so sorry to,
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:29.520]   and the thing I'm struggling with is if I'm Bill Gates,
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.060]   like, how do you behave differently?
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.780]   How do you show people that you're, if you're not,
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.600]   I don't know, doing creepy stuff
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.140]   that they're saying he's doing?
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.860]   - Well, I think part of it is that
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.260]   he's done some really good stuff, right?
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.180]   He's an innovative guy,
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:45.060]   he's on the vanguard of a lot of things.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.160]   But he's also the antichrist.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.300]   And I think that that is, you know,
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:51.340]   they're not mutually exclusive.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:54.300]   He is the prince of darkness, as well as some,
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.940]   no, here's my deal with Bill Gates.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.300]   He's a Batman villain billionaire,
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.380]   meaning that he's not a villain,
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.740]   but he's got all this money, right?
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.260]   Here's the thing, and I love Mosk and all these guys,
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.420]   I know you love these guys.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.620]   Listen, when you have the kind of money that these guys have
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.260]   and you have the vision that they have,
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.200]   and they want society to look a certain way,
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.060]   and a lot of them are doing great things,
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.980]   people, they need to get better at the pushback.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.180]   They need to get a little better.
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:16.860]   When somebody says, "Hey man, what's going on over there?"
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.540]   Bill Gates needs to be a little better at going,
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.740]   "Here's what."
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.680]   Because, you know, Bill Gates has the money.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.300]   You know, I think he once, he wanted to shoot a missile
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.620]   of dust at the atmosphere to help global warming.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:29.560]   And a lot of scientists were like,
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.240]   "Hey man, that might not be the way to do it."
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.300]   But no one in history, like so few people in history
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.540]   have had the resources to even have that thought.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.060]   That if you have the resources to have that thought,
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.120]   and you have designs on the way you want society to look,
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.900]   whether it's public health policy,
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.300]   or vaccinations, whatever,
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.420]   you have to get a little better
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.660]   at dealing with legitimate critiques.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.220]   And obviously you're not defending yourself
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.740]   against people that say you're the Antichrist,
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.700]   but like, you need to get a little better.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.820]   And I feel like Bill Gates and some of those people
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:55.900]   at that level are like, "Ugh."
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.900]   PR is kind of like, you know, beneath that.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:58.740]   - They're terrible at it.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.580]   - They're terrible at it.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:00.400]   They're terrible at it.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.500]   - Him and Zuckerberg are really bad at it.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.700]   - Zuckerberg's horrible at it.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:07.700]   He seems especially bad at public policy.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.980]   - Yeah, and it makes me feel so bad
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:13.180]   because the problem with being a billionaire
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:16.520]   is you lose touch with reality if you're not careful.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.420]   I think Elon is good at, at least so far,
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.260]   maintaining touch with reality.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.340]   - No, if you look at the name of his child,
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.740]   you can clearly see.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.180]   Listen, I do like him,
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.020]   and I do think what he's done with Tesla,
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:30.340]   you know, my producer has a Tesla,
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.660]   and he never shuts up about it.
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:34.140]   Most people that have Teslas never shut up about them,
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.700]   and they think they're part
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.260]   of the development team at SpaceX.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.900]   And I like that he's created a world
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.180]   where people can get excited about a $37,000 car
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:44.940]   and never shut the fuck up about it
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.580]   to the point where I have to threaten people
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:49.220]   with physical violence to get them to stop telling me
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:50.860]   about that their car drives itself.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.700]   - Oh, you should get a Tesla.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:52.860]   - Maybe have a few less drinks
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.940]   and a few fewer Vicodin, and you can drive yourself.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:57.060]   - Have you thought about getting a Tesla?
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:57.900]   - I've never thought about it.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:58.740]   I don't like them. - You should get a Tesla.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:29:59.660]   - They're minimalist.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.260]   I don't like, I want more.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.180]   I want more.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.100]   - Get the Cybertruck.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:07.420]   - I wanna stage, I wanna, my guy, my dude,
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:09.140]   my producer wants a Cybertruck.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.780]   I want a stagecoach.
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:14.100]   Old school stagecoach horse thief shit.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.860]   - You should ride a horse.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.900]   - It's going back to that.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.260]   I live in an area with a lot of horses.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.540]   It's going back to like whipping a horse.
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.900]   I want an animal to shriek while I go by.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:25.620]   (laughing)
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.620]   - You want more suffering in the world, not less.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.860]   - Oh, I think we need it.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:33.420]   - Okay, but I just don't like that billionaire is a bad word
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.060]   and it's not necessarily,
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:37.140]   not every billionaire is a pedophile.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.860]   - I know, but the problem is a lot of like,
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.780]   it's just, you know, Epstein was very smart
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.260]   at like just getting people at that house
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:44.980]   and taking photos of them.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.020]   Nobody knew what they were doing,
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.260]   but it's like, it was one of those things
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.300]   where it's like, Epstein was the most social guy ever.
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.580]   Like every photo, he's like, hey.
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.780]   And it's like everyone that's ever done anything
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.140]   in the world has been at that fucking island.
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.540]   Every human being is like in a photo.
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:00.380]   It's just weird.
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:01.700]   Like I'm in, like, it's funny, me and my friends
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:04.140]   get together, we don't ever take photos, right?
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.580]   Like last night, a few people,
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.860]   it was my birthday yesterday, I'm 17.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.660]   And my friends came over and we're just eating dinner, right?
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:13.700]   And we had a fun night and just four people that are over,
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:14.660]   nobody, right?
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:18.100]   Nobody ever thought like, let's, hey, I wanna remember it.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.940]   Let's take photos, I'm 36, woo!
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.500]   But everything Epstein did,
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.540]   there's just photos of everybody, it's interesting.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.300]   - Do you think Jeffrey Epstein killed himself?
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.380]   - No, I think he was killed by that guy
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:35.320]   that they put in a cell,
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:38.140]   that lunatic who was that big muscled guy.
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:40.340]   I think he was just, he did it for money,
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:41.340]   kept his mouth shut.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.620]   - That money from whom do you think?
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:47.220]   - Mossad, MI6, CIA, all three.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.300]   - So there's a lot of pressure
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.940]   from a lot of different powerful people.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.860]   - Probably Mossad, CIA more.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:55.260]   I mean, it seems very clear that he was working
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:57.820]   in type of a honeypot intelligence operation.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:01.140]   Ghislaine Maxwell's father was an Israeli super spy.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.460]   Ghislaine Maxwell's working for Israeli intelligence.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.660]   It would be odd to think.
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:06.400]   And of course the CIA knows about everything
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.940]   that Israeli intelligence is doing with Americans.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:12.060]   So I would think that it's a very cozy relationship
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.900]   with those two intelligence agencies.
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.820]   And I think if you ran it by anyone,
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.260]   I think if you ran it by French intelligence,
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:19.580]   they'd go, "Yeah, no, get him."
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.140]   I don't think there was any intelligence service
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.580]   in the world whose job is to protect the powerful people
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.540]   that live in their countries
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.060]   that was against him getting whacked.
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:28.180]   - But do you think it's possible
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.060]   that he's just an evil person
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.860]   who is after manipulating people and also was a profile?
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.780]   So there's a bigger thing.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:37.900]   - It's factual that there's a bigger thing.
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:38.740]   Evil people don't get handed-
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.820]   - Those are your facts, Tim Dillon.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.620]   - No, they're the facts of the case.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.300]   You don't get handed a 65.
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.180]   Show me another evil guy who was handed
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.460]   a $65 million place by Les Wexner.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.140]   Show me another evil guy that got that type
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:57.540]   of a handshake deal where he was basically let off
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.380]   without anything after a judge had made
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.940]   a very sweetheart deal for him
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:06.260]   after he was accused of molesting a 14-year-old.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:09.340]   Show me another evil guy that doesn't have
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.620]   that kind of backing, that has those type of friends,
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.660]   those connections, those type of properties.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.920]   Show me multiple passports all over the world.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.420]   So show me a guy without anyone backing him that's doing it.
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:23.180]   Why did they, so you think he's just an evil guy
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.980]   so he's doing this for whom?
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:26.980]   It's his own just shits and giggles?
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.340]   He's just getting off on it?
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:29.300]   - Human nature, yeah.
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:30.380]   - Human nature, huh?
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:31.340]   It's human nature?
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.620]   $70 million limestone mansion.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.780]   - Visibly mocked.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.380]   - Yeah, is it human nature?
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.100]   - And it's like poetry. - I don't think
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:38.940]   it's human nature.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:41.820]   I think they manipulated human nature,
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.540]   but I think they did it.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.540]   I think Just Lane, I think Epstein was really
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.580]   just a functionary and I think Just Lane
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:50.340]   was kind of a pimp and Epstein was kind of a guy
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:54.300]   that made the money okay and hid money and things like that
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.180]   and worked for a lot of powerful people.
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:00.060]   I don't believe in lone pedophiles anymore.
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.060]   I don't even believe that.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.900]   If you're a pedophile, you're like in a group.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.100]   You know what I mean?
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.500]   You know?
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.460]   - Well, I'm not even going there,
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.780]   but staying on Just Lane, so you believe
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.060]   there's some power in her.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.380]   What do you think happens to her now?
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.220]   Like what are the--
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.460]   - Great question.
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:19.900]   I mean, I don't know what'll happen to her,
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:22.900]   but I imagine she'll get some type of deal,
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:24.940]   closed door thing years from now
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.860]   when people don't really care about the case
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.400]   and she'll serve some time in a very lax thing
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.300]   or she'll be killed.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.780]   I mean, again, it's like if she was doing
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.220]   what she was doing, which is I believe a fact
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.660]   that she was compromising powerful people
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.260]   so that they could be blackmailed
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:45.260]   by the intelligence services of the US and Israel,
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:51.140]   probably, I don't see how she wasn't doing that.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:53.900]   Someone's blackmailing, someone's using the photos
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:55.060]   and the tapes, right?
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.680]   Someone's using that against these people.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.300]   Someone wants to control these people.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.720]   Well, who and why?
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.040]   That's the real question.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.600]   And I think the real question is you wanna exert control
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.120]   over congressmen and senators and presidents
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.960]   because they have the power to make decisions
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.740]   to affect the, but the CIA just works
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.960]   for a lot of very wealthy people.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.640]   That's what the CIA, so how the CIA started, right?
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.940]   It was lawyers, bankers.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.200]   They're protecting financial interests
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:25.120]   of multinational corporations all over the world,
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.600]   overthrowing democratically elected governments,
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.440]   going in and doing subterfuge campaigns,
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.900]   encouraging terror, they were doing all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:33.320]   I don't see why that would change.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.860]   I think that's who they still represent.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:38.460]   And I think those people want certain policies
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.120]   and certain people pushed forward.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.120]   And I think those people are controlled.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.060]   And I think one of the ways to control people
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.120]   is their sexual problems and that's the way they did it.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.840]   - I wish there was a way to,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.520]   'cause everything you just said now is--
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.320]   - Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.880]   I'm being indoctrinated on air.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.720]   No, it was just--
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:01.640]   - You think you're just a,
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.600]   Jeff Ramsey is just a fun random guy
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.560]   who just wanted to make home movies of presidents?
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.740]   - Well, you think I'm just some random guy?
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:11.900]   I'm just trying to sell myself as somebody
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.280]   who's friendly with the American audience.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.460]   - I believe you are backed by people
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.560]   that want people to be more comfortable with robot dogs.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.380]   I believe that.
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.760]   I believe you're pushed to be the happy face of AI.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.720]   - Which is why I will edit this part out.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.720]   - They should have picked the happier face.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.680]   No editing, Joe Rogan's rule, no editing.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.720]   - This is live.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.640]   No, I mean, I wish there was a way to,
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.140]   for some of the conspiracy theories
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:37.000]   to prove that that's not the case.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.660]   Like what the CIA is,
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.440]   there is some possibility in my mind
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.240]   that institutions like the CIA
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.600]   and different kind of organizations
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.600]   are driven less by organized malevolence
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.700]   and more by just incompetence,
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:56.720]   just bureaucracy being incompetent.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.440]   - I think that argument gets less and less persuasive
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.000]   when you look at all the things they've been able to do.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.360]   - They spot, it's very certain,
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.560]   just like you said, that there's a bunch of them
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.020]   that have done, there's some conspiracy theories
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:14.040]   that are dramatic and true.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:17.440]   The question is, I wish there was a way to prove
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.080]   that some of them are not.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.160]   And it's very difficult
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.520]   because so much is shrouded in mystery.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.360]   Like one of the things I'm bothered by
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.020]   is when people accuse other,
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:28.760]   like athletes of using steroids, for example.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.040]   And it's just, yes, a lot of people use steroids,
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.760]   but it sucks that people just don't believe you.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.840]   Like there's some incredible athletes that look shredded,
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.420]   that look just incredible performers,
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.920]   and everybody just says that they're on steroids.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.760]   They kind of assume.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.960]   - Yeah, I mean, and people accuse me all the time
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.420]   of being on performance-enhancing drugs and steroids.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:53.320]   And it is hard, but what I remind them is,
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:58.320]   it's what my appearance is a result of dedication.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.160]   But no, it's hard work, diet, exercise, dedication.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.080]   - Are you on keto?
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.680]   - I'm on, I'm doing a version of, you're keto, right?
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.520]   - Yeah.
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:11.540]   - So I'm doing a version of keto right now with bread.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.240]   And it's, do you see what I mean?
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.440]   - You carb up in order to be--
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.160]   - So it's keto with sugar.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.080]   It's called keto plus sugar.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.180]   And it's a good diet for,
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.740]   I grew up in the '90s when nobody ever lost weight, sadly,
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.620]   because every diet was like,
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.260]   you can eat what you want, just be accountable.
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.020]   No one even knew what that meant.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.500]   So it would be like my mother being like,
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.840]   if you have chocolate chip pancakes, have a glass of water.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:35.680]   - Yeah.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.900]   - Just take a walk around the block.
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:40.020]   You can go to McDonald's three times a day.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.060]   Just walk around the block.
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:42.060]   It's what my parents used to say.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.540]   My mother would be like, just walk around the block.
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:45.500]   You're fine.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.680]   Gonna have a cigarette?
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.700]   Walk 20 steps.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.000]   Walk 20 steps back.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.380]   It's exercise.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:54.500]   So, no, there's too many conspiracies out there.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.320]   A lot of them aren't true.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.660]   A lot of them are bitter, angry people
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:59.820]   trying to justify their own impotence,
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:01.260]   not being able to do anything in life.
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.580]   And they're like, the people that have done something
[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:04.180]   in life, they're all nefarious.
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:05.940]   It's all, the car just acted against me.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.660]   That's 100% true, 100%.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:13.220]   It attracts usually people that have not figured out a way
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:16.220]   to succeed, or haven't succeeded on the level
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.660]   that they want to.
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:22.120]   But that also being true, there is a fair amount
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.600]   of fuckery going on, and provable.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.940]   And we just have to, I think, separate,
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:34.560]   know that these things are often inflated or not true,
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.200]   but know that sometimes they are true.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.960]   Otherwise, it wouldn't exist.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.160]   If there was no, if there was nothing to JFK,
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.520]   if there was nothing to 9/11, if people felt like
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.740]   they were being dealt with honestly, this wouldn't exist.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:50.860]   I mean, this exists because there are real questions
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.580]   that people have that don't get answered
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:53.780]   for whatever reason.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:57.220]   And then the vacuum of the refusal to answer those questions,
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:00.140]   that information vacuum, is filled with people
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.140]   like Alex Jones, who are curious,
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.460]   and sometimes they're right, and sometimes
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.060]   they're horribly wrong, and sometimes
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.140]   they're all over the place.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.140]   - And good storytellers, and people love stories,
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.820]   and when there's an absence of actual--
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:13.940]   - Alex is a uniquely American person,
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.860]   like very interesting.
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.060]   I don't know how many countries,
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.260]   how many people make a living as a conspiracy theorist,
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:20.140]   a good living, in other countries, right?
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.660]   It's very rare, right?
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.420]   I mean, it's very interesting, and he became,
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.180]   like I know people that knew him when he was a kid,
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:27.260]   'cause I'd go to Austin and perform a lot,
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.980]   and he was a guy that would take a bullhorn
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:30.220]   and yell at cops 'cause he thought
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:32.140]   D.W.E. checkpoints were unconstitutional.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.900]   That's what he was doing in college.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.860]   And he just went through, he was hated by the right.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.220]   He was hated by the Bush people.
[01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:41.340]   He was hated by the, and he went from being this guy
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:44.220]   that was considered a leftist, even.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.660]   Even though he was never a leftist,
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.660]   he was considered this enemy of mainstream conservatism.
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.080]   Like he was not, and they considered a guy
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.860]   that wasn't a patriot, wasn't this, wasn't that.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:58.540]   And he just, wow, he whines and whines,
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:01.060]   and ends up just being this confidant
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.540]   of a Republican president,
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.460]   a very divisive Republican president,
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:06.380]   and he becomes this populist and everything like that.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.100]   It's really wild to watch that.
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.420]   But I do think he should retire eventually,
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.500]   just so we could get some, I don't know,
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:14.940]   it seems like a, it's a lot to keep doing.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:17.620]   - Well, I hope this world allows for Alex Jones
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.140]   to continue having a voice,
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.540]   because just like you said, he's a,
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:24.860]   you used the word fun, but really,
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:28.740]   he shakes up the norms of our discourse.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.720]   - I do too, I do think we need to put more value.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.940]   I think entertainment, we do need to say
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:35.540]   that there are people that should be allowed
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:37.980]   to have a voice for entertainment purposes.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:38.820]   - Right.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:40.940]   - And that's part of what Donald Trump,
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.880]   now that he's not the president, come on.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.180]   Let the guy, let him talk.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:49.320]   - Who do you think is the best comedian of all time?
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.860]   - Oh, that's a great question.
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:53.020]   Greatest of all time.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.760]   - You mentioned Carlin, your uncle's liking Carlin.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.660]   - Well, Carlin is great.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.660]   Carlin is really hard to argue with,
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:07.340]   but Chappelle is also really great.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:11.060]   Louis C.K. is really great.
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:15.140]   I don't know that there's what Joan Rivers is great.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.500]   I don't know, you smile at that.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.300]   But she's a beast of a comic.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.820]   - I'm not aware of her standup actually.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:20.820]   - She's a beast of a comic.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.320]   Ask Rogue and ask any of them.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.260]   Kinnison's great.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:26.980]   - So what makes a great comic, do you think,
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:29.060]   in the history of comedy?
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:29.880]   Just like--
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:33.020]   - Said something at the moment in a way,
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.680]   found a way to communicate with people
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.220]   in the funniest possible way at that moment
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:43.220]   and illustrated larger truths about life in what they did.
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:46.960]   And I think that guys like Louis and Chappelle
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.180]   and Pryor and Kinnison and Hicks,
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:53.200]   people like Joan Rivers have done that.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.040]   And even modern people,
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.760]   people like Maria Bamford's an amazing comedian.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.460]   It's just a different style of comedy per se,
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.960]   but she's an amazing comedian.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.540]   Cat Williams is an amazing comedian.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.380]   She really is.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.020]   - Does he have any,
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:10.040]   well see, one of the things you kind of mentioned,
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.180]   the communities you mentioned,
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.780]   they were kind of fearless in saying
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.280]   the difficult things that needs to be said.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.760]   Cat Williams is more, I don't remember his comedy,
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.540]   but I think it's just more wild out there.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.960]   - Well, to an extent, but you can watch it.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.600]   He's got stuff, he talks about stuff.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.980]   He talks about race brilliantly.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.640]   He talks about America brilliantly.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.400]   No, I think there's a lot of stuff there.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.520]   - Of course, Chris Rock.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.580]   - Of Chris Rock, of course.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.280]   It's so hard, you can't really pick one.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.080]   You just gotta, there's a class of people
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.020]   that throughout the history of this business,
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.360]   which is not that long of a history,
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.660]   it's pretty much within the last century,
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:44.760]   that have been really influential.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.020]   Sometimes it's style, the way they deliver things.
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.920]   Sometimes it's substance of how they,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:50.800]   what they're saying,
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.000]   or sometimes it's just a style of what they're saying.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.200]   And we're only talking about standup comedians, right?
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.760]   So there's a million great comedians.
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.600]   I mean, if we're gonna talk about Jim Carrey
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.560]   and Adam Sandler and Chris Farley,
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.760]   I mean, these are brilliant.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.960]   And those guys are bigger influences on comedy,
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.240]   I think, than standups, really, truly.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.600]   So there's so many brilliant people in the business.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:12.400]   - Who was for you influential, just the early on?
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.340]   - Hicks was influential, 'cause I'd watch Bill Hicks,
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:17.320]   and I'd be like, this guy's saying crazy shit on stage,
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.680]   and this is the only way you can get away with it
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.200]   is 'cause it's so funny.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.720]   And he was calling out the military industrial complex,
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.340]   and he was talking about the first Gulf War.
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.280]   I remember he said a joke that I heard,
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.120]   it made me sit up straight.
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.960]   He goes, he was in Canada,
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.240]   and he said, "We had a war in the States."
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.120]   He was talking about the first Gulf War.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.680]   And he said, "I was in the unenviable position
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.920]   "of being for the war, but against the troops."
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.640]   And to me, I love that joke.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.540]   It was so funny to me.
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:44.560]   And I was like, oh, you can't get away with that anywhere
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.700]   other than standing on a stage.
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.840]   You could never say that in an office, really.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.800]   And this was before it was like PC.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.800]   And the other thing, I always knew that comedians
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.840]   had to say shit and have it be funny enough
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.940]   that you couldn't get away with it in polite society.
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:44:59.920]   That was the whole point.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.760]   That was why it was a dark theater or a dark nightclub.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.960]   That's why people had a few drinks.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.240]   That's what the art form was.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.200]   And that's why, so a guy like that was influential
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.840]   'cause I started watching him.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.160]   And then, of course, I loved SNL when I was a kid,
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.420]   and I would watch Chris Farley,
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:17.040]   and I would watch people like even John Belushi
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:17.920]   going back in the day,
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:20.040]   but I'd watch Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:20.880]   and all these guys.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.160]   I mean, there's so many funny people,
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.820]   but Bill Hicks was kind of funny.
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.760]   And then Patrice O'Neill was probably my favorite comedian
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.920]   who's made me laugh more than anybody else.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:34.000]   - I think it was you, actually, that,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.360]   maybe on your podcast, we're talking about Patrice O'Neill,
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:40.160]   that he was actually vicious to others.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.040]   - I think he was a little mean to other people,
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.060]   but he was very good to people that he liked, I guess.
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:46.360]   I think he was like, I mean, he wasn't,
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.500]   and I've never met him, I have no inside info,
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:51.640]   but from what I've heard, he was like no nonsense guy.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.200]   He just said what he wanted to say.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.720]   But I think in terms of comedians,
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.440]   I don't know of anyone funnier than Patrice O'Neill
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:01.200]   who said, in modern times,
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:03.180]   that said more about our society than him.
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.320]   I mean, he was just a brilliantly funny guy.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.960]   On the radio, he was funny.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.900]   On his specials, he was funny.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.160]   Everywhere, he was funny.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.520]   - And there's something else to be said
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.960]   about the whole medium of comedians doing podcasts.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.800]   - Yeah.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.280]   - 'Cause that's, it unlocks a weird, special,
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:20.320]   new thing that changed everything.
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.440]   I mean, Rogan started with that.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.260]   - Yeah.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.100]   - You're doing that.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.840]   - I think that's a whole 'nother form of stand-ups.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.800]   - Yeah.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.960]   - The ones that have a lot to say.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.580]   Almost like we get to witness the process
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:39.600]   of the creation of the jokes in a way, or the mind.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.440]   - Right.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:43.960]   - The sort of the evolution of the mind behind the jokes.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.140]   It's just--
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:47.160]   - Comedians relate to social media.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:52.160]   Comedians, comedy's a, it's a performance-based medium.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.960]   So it's about getting up and doing it,
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.920]   getting up in a club, getting up in a theater,
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.800]   getting up in a bar, getting up wherever you can get up.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:03.080]   And comedy, for years, was about performance.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.120]   And then on the higher end,
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.560]   it was about movies and TV shows.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.600]   But we were very slow to get on YouTube.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.960]   We were very slow to adapt to technology.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.120]   We were very slow to monetize anything
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.480]   we did on the internet.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.960]   So podcasting was a way for comics and funny people
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.680]   to kinda get into that space, start earning money,
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.160]   and now, because of the pandemic,
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.040]   it's really become essential.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.120]   And it helps you, and even without the pandemic,
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.080]   it was where people,
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:32.680]   it was how you were building a fan base.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.280]   And that's like, you know,
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.920]   but comics were very reticent to embrace social media at all
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:39.880]   because they thought it was cheap and they didn't like it.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:41.500]   And they thought the people on it were idiots
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.640]   and were unfunny, and it was just a blatant,
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:45.680]   you know, whatever it was, whether it was a money grab,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.480]   or it was just too commercial,
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:48.800]   and in a sense where they're like,
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:49.800]   "Hey, look at me."
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.620]   Like, it was just goofy, right?
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.760]   And then comics, I think, got displaced
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.680]   because all the YouTubers came in
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.400]   and all the social media stars came in,
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.100]   and they really knocked comics off
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:04.920]   because now people are much more,
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.200]   like if you ask anyone under 30
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.960]   who their favorite comedian is, they say David Dobrik.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:09.800]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.080]   David's a funny guy, but like what you,
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:17.480]   you know, not especially to me a ton, but that's okay.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.800]   I don't, you know, but he makes people laugh,
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.640]   so he's funny.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:24.760]   But he's what people, you know, that's a comedian now.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:28.040]   So comics got beat by other people
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:31.520]   coming into a digital space before they did,
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.000]   laying the groundwork and taking it over,
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.480]   and now comics are just trying to stay alive.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:41.320]   Like even my podcast, which is, people really like it,
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.360]   thank God, and I love doing it.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.520]   - The Tim Dillon Show.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.420]   - Well, thank you.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:49.000]   I was late, you know?
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.760]   I mean, I was, I just, you know,
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.200]   I've been podcasting for a long time,
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.480]   but really dedicating myself
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.640]   and putting the resources behind it, I was late to it.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:58.120]   Like I was like, hey, I'm telling jokes on stage,
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.560]   which is great, but I should have been allocating more time
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.360]   to building an infrastructure online,
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.660]   and I wasn't doing it, and a lot of comics weren't doing it.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.400]   Funny comics weren't doing it.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.080]   Comics that should be doing it,
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.320]   and I think when the pandemic ends,
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.200]   a lot of comics will just keep doing live standup,
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.640]   but I will keep, obviously I'm gonna go back on the road
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:16.640]   and do live standup, but I will keep doing this podcast
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.480]   and building digitally too.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.280]   - But you're also exploring ideas.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.120]   You're doing like short videos and so on.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.320]   You're trying to look for different mediums
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.360]   of how to be funny. - I wanna be funny everywhere.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.280]   I wanna be funny everywhere.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.520]   I love making things too.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.200]   My producer, Ben Avery, is like a brilliant editor
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.120]   and comedic mind, even though he's not a standup.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:38.120]   He's able to, he understands funny,
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.240]   he understands what makes me funny.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.960]   We're able to make these really, I mean,
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:44.040]   some of those videos, they're just brilliant little videos,
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.440]   even though they're tiny little videos,
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.580]   they're fucking as funny as anything,
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:50.920]   and it's not me, it's me working with somebody else
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.880]   to make something really great,
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:56.200]   and it's that relationship that's very important.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.400]   - Well, in some sense, the medium of a short video
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.240]   is a challenge, just like the medium of a short tweet.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:04.960]   - Of course. - Of how to say something.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.980]   I mean, whatever the flavor is of what's in your heart,
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:10.440]   what's in your mind, how to say it,
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.640]   whether it's the goal is funny or something,
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.840]   or just an express an idea.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.240]   I think the whole thing that's important to us
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.220]   is that it's an extension of,
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.340]   really like an extension of your friendship in a way.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:24.580]   Like, are you guys laughing at it?
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.940]   Are you guys making each other laugh about this idea?
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.220]   And if that's the case,
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.860]   other people are going to laugh at it.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.900]   I think so much of the old medium
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.860]   was like everything was top-down.
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:38.720]   Okay, pitch me this idea, I pitch it to the showrunner,
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:39.920]   they pitch it to the network,
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.020]   they pitch it to this, to that, to the, you know.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.820]   Standards and practices, sales,
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:45.480]   and we gotta go through everything.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:48.000]   Now it's just like, are me and a few buddies,
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.220]   or even just one buddy, laughing at this idea?
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:52.700]   Does it captivate us?
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:55.060]   And do we see it visually?
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:58.580]   And also a great line from Roseanne,
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:01.920]   a guy, not Roseanne, but a guy that worked on Roseanne,
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.260]   the old Roseanne, the great one, he said,
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:06.660]   "Is it funny with the sound off?"
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:07.820]   - Right. - That's what we try to do.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:10.060]   - That's brilliant. - Is it funny with the sound off?
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.900]   When you see me in the dumb things,
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:15.140]   or me in the Meghan McCain, or me in the thing,
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:15.980]   is it funny with the sound off?
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:17.500]   And if it's funny with the sound off,
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.620]   you have a good starting point.
[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:20.820]   - That's hilarious, 'cause you,
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:22.860]   I would say you're one of the people,
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:25.180]   'cause most people are not funny with the sound off,
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.880]   most comedians, you, Will Ferrell's another example of that.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:32.620]   There's something about when I click on one of your videos,
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:35.140]   it's funny, just like the first thing I see,
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.820]   just your face.
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.060]   - We, well, thank you, that's very sweet.
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.300]   But I mean, that's, thank God,
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.660]   I mean, that's what we try to do, right?
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.980]   We're trying to be funny.
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:45.060]   So we're trying to be funny.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.580]   - Can we talk about love a little bit?
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:48.140]   - Sure.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:52.420]   - So you came out of the closet as being gay
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.700]   when you were 25.
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:55.780]   - Yeah, it was late, very late.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.620]   - Very late.
[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:58.260]   Before then. - By today's standards.
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:03.260]   - During and after, how has your view on love evolved?
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.740]   - Interesting.
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:08.300]   It's so hard to say, because I would,
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.260]   I'd like to make a very Disney-fied statement
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:15.740]   about like that you can't be in love secretively.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:16.700]   You should be honest.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:17.860]   Love should all be about honesty,
[01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:19.740]   but that's not true, right?
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:21.460]   There's people that are in love
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:23.660]   that are lying to everyone else,
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:25.900]   but they're deeply in love.
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.060]   I would love to say something like,
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:30.180]   honesty is an ingredient for love, you know?
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:33.060]   But I don't know, maybe honesty with each other.
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:35.820]   But I mean, I think there's a lot of people in the world
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:37.020]   that aren't honest.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:39.420]   My view on love is super important.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:43.500]   I think that it's, a lot of society in America
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:44.860]   is all about love.
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:49.060]   We don't tend to focus on other things
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:52.020]   in terms of like, you know, friendship
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:54.780]   or sustainability of that.
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:55.660]   'Cause I think that a lot,
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.140]   I know a lot of people in relationships
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.660]   where it's like, I don't know, they're not,
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.220]   they are, they love each other,
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:04.020]   but like, it's also a rock solid couple
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:07.740]   because they are, they're very compatible
[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:09.060]   in many other ways.
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:09.900]   - Right.
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:10.740]   - So I think that like-- - They're friends.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:11.620]   - They have, right.
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:14.020]   - I see friendship and love as the same thing.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.300]   - There's just parts of it that are, right?
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.340]   So it's like, I look at it as like,
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:21.740]   there is, there needs to be more than just like that,
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:25.900]   like amazing like chemistry or physical attraction
[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:28.620]   that is this chemical thing that happens.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:30.460]   There should be like some underlying.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:32.860]   I mean, again, that's from what I,
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:36.140]   that's what I've observed as really long lasting,
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:37.620]   successful relationships.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:40.220]   - Well, is there something about coming out
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:45.220]   that was, that you took away that you remember
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:48.540]   as being profound and insightful and so on?
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:51.460]   - Yes, that it was my, that I, it wasn't society,
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:52.720]   it was me.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.220]   So there were kids that were out in my high school
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:58.600]   that I waited years later to do it.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.500]   That was no one's fault but my own.
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.660]   So I was taking a cowardly way out
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:05.820]   and a lot of people, so I could blame society
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:07.860]   or like, oh, I lived in a conservative area
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:11.020]   and I grew up in a, you should take responsibility
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:11.860]   for your own decisions.
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.780]   And if you're being cowardly,
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:14.500]   admit that you're being cowardly.
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.220]   So that's what I took out of it is that
[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:19.220]   it's not society's fault that you chose to be a coward.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:21.100]   Society will never be perfect.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.580]   You have to be honest when you're ready to be honest
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:26.100]   or however you want to be honest, but it's not somebody,
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:28.460]   too much now is it's everyone else's fault
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:31.620]   that you didn't take, make a hard choice or a hard decision.
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:33.740]   So that's kind of what I took out of it.
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.340]   - So now in retrospect, you see yourself as,
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:38.220]   or being afraid.
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.780]   Do you think at the time?
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:42.140]   - Well, I wanted people to like me,
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:45.100]   which is the disease of humanity, right?
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.220]   Is that we want to be liked.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.820]   And what happens is if you want people to like you
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:50.900]   and love you, even you want people
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.100]   to feel comfortable with you.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.780]   - And those were people like your family?
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:55.140]   - Friends, more.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:56.420]   My family, I would always,
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:59.600]   could always throw in the street, but I'm kidding.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.780]   I mean, but I am not.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.700]   But my friends, my circle of friends,
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:05.300]   which were my family at the time,
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.860]   when you're a senior,
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.420]   when you're 10th, 11th grade in high school,
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:10.660]   your friends are your family, you know what I mean?
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:12.820]   Like that's your, so you don't want to do anything
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:15.300]   that puts you on the outside of the circle.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.780]   - So thinking back to that fear,
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:19.420]   is there things you're afraid of now
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:21.940]   that you're not doing, you're afraid to do?
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:24.020]   - I'm afraid of all kinds of things.
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:26.580]   I'm afraid of not being good at my job,
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:29.900]   not being funny, letting people down,
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:33.260]   not putting out products that are good,
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:36.020]   whether it's the podcast every week or standup
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.780]   or the videos, like I'm afraid of like,
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.160]   there's a ton of people that really enjoy what we do.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.620]   So when you're in that position,
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:44.540]   you're nervous that you're going to start doing things
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:45.380]   that they don't like.
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:46.900]   So the new things you want to do,
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:48.500]   the evolution you want to do,
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.820]   you want to make sure you're evolving in the right way.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:52.460]   You want to make sure that you're doing things
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:54.540]   that are consistent with why people liked you.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.660]   But also you don't want to put yourself in a box
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:59.800]   and limit what you can be going forward.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:02.980]   So like I had a talk with the CEO of NBC Universal once,
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:05.740]   I was doing some internal sketch for them.
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:08.660]   And I was playing like a cab driver and he was a,
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:10.820]   and he's not the current CEO, but he's a former CEO.
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:11.940]   And I said to him, what's the hardest part
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.820]   of running a corporation of this size?
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:17.100]   And he said something very interesting.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.980]   He said, the hardest part is maximizing
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:22.460]   the current profit model of what you have
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:25.180]   at the same time, getting ready, getting ready,
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:26.660]   getting the company ready for where it's going to be
[01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:27.900]   in five years.
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.740]   He said, those are often at odds.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:30.920]   And that's the toughest thing.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.120]   He goes, 'cause I could just bang out everything
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.040]   I got to do right now.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.780]   And we're going to make a lot of money doing this,
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:37.820]   but am I devoting enough resources into digital
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:39.860]   so that in five years when that's where everything lives,
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:42.140]   are we competitive in that space?
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:44.820]   So as funny as I am now, hopefully to people
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:46.460]   and a lot of the things that I want to do now,
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:49.820]   I'm going, what am I, what groundwork am I not laying
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:51.980]   for three to five years down the road
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:55.580]   so that I can be adapting to the trends
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:58.360]   that are important then in terms of not so much
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.540]   the comedic trends, but like the technological trends.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:04.340]   Like what is the, what is the, you know,
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:06.220]   I should have done podcasting earlier.
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:09.100]   What, should I have a bigger presence on TikTok?
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.220]   Should I have a bigger presence here?
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.100]   Should I have a, should I be on Twitch?
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:12.940]   Should I be doing this?
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.760]   Should I be doing that?
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.540]   What am I not doing that I should be doing
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.260]   that I'll regret not doing?
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:20.380]   And those are the conversations I think I have
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.220]   in my own head all the time.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:23.340]   - And I guess there's parallels to coming out as gay
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:27.140]   or just parallels in like a career paths you're taking,
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:30.000]   all that, that's ultimately just fear.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:30.840]   - It's fear.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:31.660]   - Yeah.
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:34.640]   - It's the fear of, you know, the best thing that happened
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:37.060]   in my career was that I came to LA.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:41.760]   I didn't have an idea of what was going to happen.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.720]   I met somebody who was really committed
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:48.400]   to making funny things.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.060]   That we just wanted to be funny.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:51.240]   No one would let us be funny.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.880]   We didn't have Comedy Central letting us be funny.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:54.800]   We didn't have HBO.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.720]   We didn't have Netflix.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.140]   We just had a garage and a phone in the beginning
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.240]   and then a camera and then a thing.
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:01.740]   And we just wanted to be funny.
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:04.020]   And that was the greatest risk really I took
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:04.860]   because I was like,
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.960]   "Well, I don't know what else is going to happen right now
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.680]   but I just want to be funny."
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:10.200]   And funny saved my life, right?
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.620]   I mean, funny got me out of drugs.
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:12.960]   Funny probably got me out of the closet.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:15.000]   Funny was the thing that I was able to do
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.840]   that made everything okay in my own head.
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.160]   So I was like, "As long as I'm being funny,
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.060]   something good will happen."
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.400]   So we did that.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.720]   And then something really cool happened
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.760]   that we were able to do a lot of cool things.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.700]   But you know, that's what it is.
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:27.000]   It's fear that keeps you
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.400]   from being the better version of yourself.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:33.600]   - Your mom, I mean, you have so many complicated,
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:35.000]   fascinating parts of your story.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:35.960]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:39.280]   - Your mom, as you were growing up, suffered.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.120]   - Schizophrenic, yeah.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:43.520]   - Well, from mental illness, yes, schizophrenia.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.800]   Can you tell her story
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.960]   and how that relationship has changed over the years?
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.200]   - Yeah, well, she was always eccentric
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.040]   and always, you know,
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.780]   the terms for schizophrenia in an Irish Catholic household
[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:54.000]   where we didn't talk about anything
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.420]   were eccentric, fun, she's fun.
[01:58:57.420 --> 01:58:58.260]   - There's a theme to this conversation.
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.860]   - Unpredictable.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:04.860]   She's a live wire.
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:06.740]   Any of the words you would use to describe somebody
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:09.880]   who was a fucking lunatic, but you wouldn't say that.
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.700]   - Positive spin.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:13.540]   - Right.
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:17.060]   She started experiencing symptoms
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:18.260]   probably early on in her life,
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:22.620]   but she also, I think, started really manifesting them
[01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:27.620]   when I was in my mid-teens, so like 14, 13, 14 area.
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:30.960]   And she got really, really bad.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:33.040]   And then I think she was institutionalized
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.880]   about 10 years ago, a little over 10 years ago.
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:37.740]   And she could really no longer live on her own.
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.520]   She was unable to go to work.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:40.880]   She was unable to function.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:42.040]   So I visit her when I can.
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:42.920]   Obviously, I'm not in New York.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.400]   Whenever I go to New York, I visit her.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.120]   She's aware of what I do, my career,
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.000]   and everything like that.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.360]   You know, she has good days and bad days,
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.760]   but, you know, mental illness is a thing.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:51.600]   It's very tough.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.140]   We don't talk about it as a society.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:57.180]   People with mental problems don't get that much attention.
[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:00.300]   We tend to think that they did something wrong
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:03.260]   or that they deserve it or that they are, you know,
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:06.180]   to be ignored, and we don't devote a lot of resources
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:07.300]   into it, which is unfortunate
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.980]   because then you have the junk gurus come in and go like,
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.500]   "Let's diagnose your mental illness off Instagram."
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.260]   And it's like, that's not the move.
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:15.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:17.500]   - Do you love her?
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:19.220]   - I do, I do.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.240]   I love her, but I also remember her that isn't her now.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.040]   And when someone has mental illness that's severe,
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:31.240]   you make peace with their death before they die.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:32.120]   - Wow, yeah.
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.400]   - Because the part of them that you love and remember,
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:41.400]   a lot of cases is not evident or obvious.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:44.100]   Now, my mother's still a loving person that I love,
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:48.680]   but the fun, her ability to be present
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:50.700]   in the moment and to not, you know,
[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:54.960]   that is lost with the progression of her illness
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.320]   so that you still love her.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:58.960]   And I mean, again, you know, your parents,
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:00.440]   you know, the time horizons you have
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.660]   with your parents are unknown.
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:02.500]   People don't know.
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:03.320]   You could, you know, I have friends
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.680]   that their parents were in their lives
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:06.120]   for their entire life.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:07.800]   And I have friends whose parents were in their life,
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:10.120]   but my mother was a very, she knew what I was.
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.440]   When I was a little kid, I was an actor.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.040]   When I was like six to 12,
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.420]   my mother knew that I was a performer.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:16.400]   She knew what I was and what I'd ultimately do.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.600]   She recognized that in me.
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.320]   And when I said to her, I want to audition for shows,
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.580]   I want to be on stage, I want to be on this,
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.040]   I want to do this, she let me do it
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:25.480]   because she knew who I was and she didn't want to get
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.640]   in the way of me being a human being,
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:30.680]   a fully realized person at six.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.440]   So that's probably the best thing a parent can do for a kid
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:35.960]   is let them be who they are.
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:37.760]   And my mother did that.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:39.200]   So that, I mean, that's good.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.800]   We ate too much fast food.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:44.880]   There were negatives, but she did let me be who I was.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.840]   - That's why you want to throw them out into the street.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.160]   - Yeah, sometimes.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:55.840]   - But coming to accept the mortality of her,
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:01.060]   I guess, identity as you remember it from childhood,
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:04.320]   do you ponder your own mortality?
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.160]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.000]   - I'm afraid of death.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.960]   I don't like the idea of death, but I know it's happening.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.440]   You know, I know it's going to happen eventually.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.240]   I don't love it. - Do you think about it?
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:15.800]   - I think about, I want to do some good stuff
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.000]   that people can look back at.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.400]   And I think I'm proud of the show
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.880]   where if people look back at the show,
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.640]   I don't know how comedy ages or whatever,
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:23.480]   but like, I think I put out a lot of stuff
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.840]   and I want to continue to put out stuff
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.120]   and I want to put out a few specials
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.800]   that people can look back at and go,
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:30.400]   oh, this guy was really funny in this really crazy,
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.840]   you know, he lived in the latter part of this century
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.000]   when all this shit was going on
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.680]   and he kind of made fun of it.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.680]   And he did something to make people's lives a little better
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:43.720]   just by having, you know, a few laughs, you know?
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:46.240]   - What do you think about, this is something like
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:50.680]   in the podcast context, do you think you'll have
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:55.160]   just one or two or three shows out of thousands maybe
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.000]   that are like the truly special ones?
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:57.960]   - That's probably the case.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.760]   - Or do you think it's an entirety of the body of work?
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.980]   - I think people will take 10 minute clips
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:05.640]   from all different shows and put them together and--
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.480]   - It's a highlight?
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.080]   - Yeah, like a highlight reel of just like,
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.960]   these are like the best things that he's ever done
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:13.480]   or the best rants he's ever had, the best things, whatever.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.040]   - So the legacy would be that this was an important voice
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.720]   in a very weird time of human history.
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:21.640]   - I would hope that that's part of it
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.080]   and I hope that I continue to be, you know,
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.960]   you say important, I say funny,
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:28.460]   but hopefully I continue to be a voice.
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:30.520]   And that's what I think, when I think about death,
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.480]   I think about like, what did people come on earth to do?
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:37.320]   And I think I came, I think my main purpose on this planet,
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.040]   other than to experience whatever love or, you know,
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:44.640]   worthiness or whatever is to make, to entertain people.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.200]   And there's a lot of people in comedy right now
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.800]   that are not entertainers and that's really the problem.
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:51.880]   But, and they got into comedy sort of the way that,
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:55.440]   you know, you can walk into the wrong store in a mall
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.540]   and then not realize you're in the wrong store
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:58.840]   and try on a bunch of clothes and then go,
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:00.920]   fuck, I wasted my whole afternoon.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:02.720]   But I think I've always kind of been an entertainer
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.140]   and that's what I wanna do.
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:07.000]   - There's unfortunately, sadly,
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.920]   a lot of people that look up to you.
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.880]   - That is a horrible thing.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:12.360]   - But life is a nightmare.
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:13.200]   - Yeah.
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:17.840]   If you were to give them advice, young folks,
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.320]   people in college, maybe even high school,
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:24.440]   but people in their 20s about what to do with their life,
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:27.120]   whether it's career, whether it's just life in general,
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:27.960]   what would you say?
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:31.360]   - Ignore everyone, make a few good friends,
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:37.040]   truly have honest conversations with yourself about your,
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:42.520]   when do you feel the most alive?
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:44.360]   Figure that out.
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:47.280]   When and how do you feel the most alive?
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:50.280]   Figure that out.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.160]   Try to figure out a job or a career
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.860]   that can replicate that feeling.
[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:57.440]   Don't listen to anyone.
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:58.840]   Don't listen to your parents.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:01.140]   Don't listen to the gurus on the internet.
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:02.520]   Don't listen to me.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.780]   Don't listen to anyone.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:07.500]   Figure out, you know, where you feel the most alive.
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.140]   Where do you feel excited?
[02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:11.500]   Where does your pulse quicken?
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:13.680]   What do you feel matters?
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:17.320]   When you're in a situation, do you feel like it matters?
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:18.620]   What situation was that?
[02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:20.520]   What got you excited?
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:24.480]   What thing did you walk into where you looked around
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:27.200]   and were taken back and you're like, wow, this is amazing,
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.000]   and I'm filled with awe?
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000]   If you can figure out a life where you can excite yourself,
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:37.980]   you might not use drugs or alcohol or a sex addiction
[02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:41.140]   or gambling or irresponsibility.
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:44.180]   You might not have to get your fucking kicks
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:46.460]   in very destructive places
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:49.540]   if you can get them in a productive place.
[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:53.020]   You had a pretty weaving life
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:56.900]   that's full of mistakes and so on.
[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:58.100]   Many mistakes.
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:02.260]   Is that, are mistakes a bug or a feature?
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:05.000]   Like, do you recommend embrace the mistakes,
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.080]   like make a bunch of them?
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.520]   Depends what they are, right?
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:08.360]   So--
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.960]   Well, you've had the full spectrum.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:12.680]   I've had a lot, but a lot of mine could have sunk me.
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:13.520]   Right.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.280]   Like, they sound like fun when I talk about them,
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:17.800]   but they actually could have sunk me.
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:21.440]   And they were all part of what made me funny,
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:25.040]   but I don't know, I would never tell anyone else
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:26.800]   to just light their life on fire
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:28.680]   and hope it works out on the other end.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:30.800]   It would be pretty irresponsible.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:34.760]   But hey, at the end of the day, it's like,
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:39.120]   you're gonna, we get, there's, you know,
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:41.700]   I think one of my themes is that there's too much,
[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:44.480]   we give the power, we think we have too,
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:48.000]   the power of choice has been elevated on our society
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.480]   to an unhealthy degree.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:53.080]   I think people are, I think you could get
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:53.940]   really good at something,
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:56.000]   but you're born with a certain aptitude.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.760]   It might be to be a deal maker.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:58.920]   Might be to be an athlete.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.000]   It might be to be an artist.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.680]   It might be to be a romantic
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.280]   and just fall in and out of love, in and out of love,
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.120]   in and out of love.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:05.960]   It might be to be like a world traveler.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.840]   But whatever you are, I think you are.
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:10.440]   I think that there's something about you
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.040]   that makes you something.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.720]   And if you can figure it out and then refine,
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:15.800]   you're not gonna be good at it, per se,
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:18.400]   but if you're an athlete, it might not mean
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.620]   that you're going to be a great athlete in the history,
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:22.840]   but it might mean you're the best coach anyone's ever had,
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:25.760]   or you're the person that builds a local scene
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:27.480]   for young athletes or whatever.
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:30.120]   If you are a really good deal maker,
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.480]   it doesn't mean you're gonna be Warren Buffett,
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:33.960]   but it might mean you're somebody who enjoys
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:37.120]   making deals all the time and things like that.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:38.240]   If you're an entertainer,
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:40.960]   it might mean that you are an entertainer.
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.240]   It might mean that you are in the world of entertainment
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.840]   because you love it so much that if you lack the skillset
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:50.440]   to really pursue it on a degree, you just wanna be it.
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:55.440]   There's a thing inside of you that makes you what you are.
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:57.000]   I look at certain people and I go,
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.600]   you were born to be that thing.
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.280]   - And the whole purpose is to find it.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:04.000]   - I was a juror on a murder trial in Long Island,
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.960]   and the woman who's the DA, I'm like,
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:07.320]   you were born to do this.
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:10.240]   You were born to put murderers away,
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:12.360]   and this guy killed the mother of his children,
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.680]   and he was a bad guy, but I was like,
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:15.600]   you are really good at what you do.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.600]   She has a strong belief in whatever her moral code is
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.520]   and what her justice and ethics are,
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.120]   and she wants to communicate that to people.
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:25.880]   She was very good at doing what she did.
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:27.040]   I don't know the facts of the case.
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:27.880]   I didn't really listen.
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:29.680]   He seemed guilty, so I just voted guilty.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:31.920]   But I didn't really listen to her,
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.280]   but I heard the shape of her mouth was very bovine,
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:36.880]   like a cow, and it conferred a certain level
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:39.120]   of expertise that I enjoyed.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:39.960]   - Well, it's funny.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.000]   I mean, you could see you're half joking.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:43.840]   - Yes, but I'm serious.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:46.800]   - You can often see that people just,
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:48.880]   they found their place, they found their role.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:49.720]   - They found their thing.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:51.320]   - They found their thing, and that's kind of
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:53.120]   the purpose of life, and once you are
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.800]   in a place that seems sticky,
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:59.400]   like the place that seems right, you know,
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:01.160]   that's one of the problems with the generation
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.400]   that you're speaking to, is there's always a feeling
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.660]   like I should keep exploring, keep exploring,
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:08.080]   but it's okay to stay in a place
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:09.040]   that you found that works.
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.080]   - Yeah, and listen, sometimes the best place you'll find
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:14.680]   is when people are like, when did you feel
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:15.940]   really excited and alive?
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:18.040]   It's like doing nothing.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:18.880]   - Right, yeah.
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:19.720]   (laughing)
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:20.540]   - You know?
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:21.720]   And the other thing, it's like some people
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.560]   are gonna be like, I feel really excited and alive
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.920]   when I'm laying in my backyard in a hammock,
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.520]   and I just want to have the simplest life
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.240]   and not have to do much, and I don't like doing anything,
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:31.680]   and I love laying around and going,
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:33.600]   wow, the sky looks good today.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:34.960]   Bill Gates goes, the sky looks good today,
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.320]   let's shoot a missile into it.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.580]   He wants to do shit, right?
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:40.400]   So it's like, in between that and nothing,
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.040]   you can find something.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:45.640]   - But in that process, for you personally,
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:49.520]   I mean, for me, for others, I think there's a struggle.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:52.180]   When Tim and Dylan looks in the mirror,
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.860]   do you love yourself or do you hate yourself?
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:56.780]   - Well, a lot of times I think I'm Amy Schumer,
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:58.100]   so I'm confused.
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:59.940]   (laughing)
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:01.900]   I'm a detente with myself all the time.
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:03.140]   I don't love myself or hate myself.
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:06.980]   Addicts have a very bad problem,
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:09.180]   where you can't just fall in love with yourself
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:10.500]   and you can't hate yourself.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.740]   Both of them lead you to a negative place.
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:14.820]   You try to stay kind of even keel.
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:17.300]   I don't go like, hey man, you put out a video,
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:18.780]   you got all these views, things are great,
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:20.860]   you sold a bunch of tickets, let's fucking go out.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:23.140]   Like, maybe let's, hey man, let's have that drink
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:25.060]   that you've been waiting for for 11 years.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:26.460]   And I don't look at myself and go,
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.660]   you ate a burger yesterday, you're a piece of shit,
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:32.940]   you're horrible, you'll never get into the shape you want.
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:35.180]   Like, I try not to get too low or too high.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:38.820]   Both of them are not good from my particular mind.
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:42.900]   - Okay, I gotta ask, we kind of spoke about 2021
[02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:45.180]   and you being potentially hopeful.
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:48.740]   Hopeful short-term, cynical long-term.
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.940]   - Yeah.
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:54.180]   - So let me ask, I forgot to ask, are you moving to Austin?
[02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:55.020]   - I don't know.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:57.580]   I mean, I don't think so immediately.
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.820]   I love Joe, I love what he's trying to do down there.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:02.260]   I'm appreciative of everything that he's done
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:04.660]   for not only me, but for comedy in general.
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:07.220]   And I think as things happen in Austin and unfold,
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:09.700]   it's such a political answer, but as things unfold,
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.340]   I will consider it more and more.
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.460]   But I mean, I think I got another year in LA.
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:18.660]   - So you've spoken so nicely about this magical place
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:20.020]   that is Los Angeles.
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:21.460]   - LA is very funny.
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:24.460]   - You think there's a place for comedy in LA?
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:25.860]   - Oh yeah.
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.380]   There will always be a place for comedy in LA.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:29.740]   So there's gonna be a place for comedy in New York.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:32.340]   I mean, the question is how thriving of a comedy scene
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.580]   is Austin gonna be?
[02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:36.820]   And Joe can probably make it one,
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:38.620]   but as of right now, it isn't.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:39.980]   So that would be him doing that.
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:41.260]   - But the question, there's a lot of people
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:44.780]   escaping Los Angeles, but I know better about New York.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.580]   There's a lot of really brilliant people.
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:47.420]   - Let them go.
[02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:48.660]   - There's other people.
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:49.500]   This is the thing.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:50.660]   It's like, this is the fear thing.
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:53.060]   It's like, no, but all the brilliant people are leaving.
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:55.380]   There'll be other people and they'll fill their shoes
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.660]   the way that they've done throughout history.
[02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.420]   And I think that New York and LA,
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:00.860]   listen, maybe in five to 10 years,
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.340]   they're not the two cities.
[02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:05.220]   It would be real rough in five years
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:08.420]   when this pandemic's over for people in Australia to go,
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.420]   dude, you gotta go to America
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:13.180]   and you gotta visit Charleston and Austin.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:15.140]   Stop, let's be adults here.
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:16.220]   Let's be adults.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:18.660]   It's still gonna be New York and LA for a while.
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:21.900]   LA is an absolute hellscape,
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:26.420]   but I don't think you're gonna replace California
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.940]   with another place.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.620]   And also, everyone's making decisions now
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:32.420]   because we're literally in the midst of a pandemic
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:34.020]   we've never had before.
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:35.500]   We've never had this before.
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:37.940]   Joe loved California up until the pandemic.
[02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:39.220]   He had problems with it.
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:40.660]   Like, we all have problems with it.
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.420]   There's a lot of benefits to being here.
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:45.580]   - I think a lot of us made pretty bad decisions in 2020
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:46.860]   because we were all locked up
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:48.940]   and stuck with our own thoughts.
[02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:52.060]   But, so it's funny there's parallels
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:53.460]   'cause I don't necessarily,
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:55.940]   I'm obviously a fan of comedy,
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:59.060]   but I don't care where comics move.
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:01.300]   But there's a parallel move that's happening,
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:04.380]   set of decisions which do influence my decision-making,
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:07.700]   which is where to start a business that's tech-centered.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:12.220]   And that's more about the San Francisco, Silicon Valley,
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:15.220]   and there is a lot of people leaving there.
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.780]   - That's where you're going to Austin.
[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:19.900]   - Well, Austin, there's a, I think,
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:21.340]   there's a bunch of different places.
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:23.420]   Phoenix, there's Denver.
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:26.780]   - Austin will probably be a massive tech hub.
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:27.660]   Elon's there.
[02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:30.700]   It seems like it's all, everything about Austin says
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.220]   that it's going to be a massive tech hub.
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:34.220]   I just don't know if that means
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:35.580]   it'll be a massive comedy hub.
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:36.420]   It might.
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:38.460]   - I don't know if those two can actually coexist.
[02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:39.620]   It's interesting 'cause-
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:41.660]   - Yeah, I think, you know,
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.100]   comedy suffered in New York and LA
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.740]   when everyone got super rich.
[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:47.140]   Like, you know, it just wasn't as cool.
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:48.980]   It's still much more fun on the road.
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:50.580]   It's still more fun to perform for people
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:53.460]   that want and need to laugh in strip malls
[02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:55.780]   than it is to perform for hedge fund managers
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.260]   and with their dates and, you know, Instagram models in LA.
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:00.100]   It's just what it is.
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:01.700]   Comedy on the road is much more fun.
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.380]   So maybe in the spirit of that, Austin becomes,
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:06.980]   but you know, if Austin is just colonized
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:09.220]   by tech bros and stuff, like, yeah, I mean, sure,
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:10.740]   sure it'll be fun and it'll be great.
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:13.780]   I think Joe's made LA a scene.
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:16.380]   So if anyone's gonna make Austin a scene, it's Joe.
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:20.140]   - Yeah, and I like the, on the Elon side,
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:22.300]   which is what I'm much more familiar with,
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:25.580]   the promise of the possibility of what that could become,
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:27.740]   because there's a lot of problems in Silicon Valley.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:30.620]   And of course it might be naive to think that just
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:33.100]   because it's like the grass is greener thing,
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:36.260]   which is just because the place where you come from
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:37.460]   has a lot of problems,
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:39.180]   doesn't mean you can just create a new place
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:40.020]   that's not going to have those problems.
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:41.620]   - Yeah, there's homelessness in Austin.
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:42.900]   There are problems in Austin.
[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.900]   I mean, I think that with, by the way,
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:48.180]   with the influx of very rich people to an area,
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:49.220]   sometimes that helps things,
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:51.300]   but sometimes it just makes things more polarizing
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:53.500]   and it puts a spotlight on those problems
[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:55.220]   and makes those problems even bigger, right?
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:58.100]   So, I mean, I don't know that it's necessarily,
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:14:59.220]   it's hard to predict.
[02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:01.060]   I just know that LA right now is funny.
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:03.060]   It's funny that there's 15 year old TikTokers
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:05.300]   making millions of dollars dancing in a house
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:06.460]   while the world burns.
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:07.340]   That is very funny.
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:11.180]   - Well, it's for your style of humor, yes.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:12.260]   The absurdity of the world.
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:15.380]   - It's funny that no one cares about Hollywood starlets
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:16.900]   and actresses and actors and everyone goes,
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:17.740]   "Hey, fuck you,"
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:19.580]   even though they've won three Academy Awards.
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:23.060]   They're all being replaced by just mediocre dancer,
[02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:24.020]   15 year olds.
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:25.500]   I mean, it's like there's something hilarious
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:28.580]   about this city and it will burn in hell,
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:29.660]   but so will everything.
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:31.140]   So what are we talking about?
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:34.580]   - Yeah, eventually the sun will die out
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:37.380]   and we will all be gone unless we colonize
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:38.940]   outside of our solar system.
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:42.900]   But I just sit here.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.300]   I'm struggling with this 'cause Boston,
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.500]   I'm currently at MIT,
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:49.540]   Boston doesn't feel like the right place to start
[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:52.660]   a business in the tech sector.
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:54.820]   And so I'm choosing, I'm looking at San Francisco
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:56.820]   the way it is and I'm looking at Austin.
[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:58.340]   - Oh, Austin, clearly.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:02.260]   - So it seems clear, but it's such a difficult thing
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:07.500]   to predict what a place will look like in 10 years,
[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:08.980]   in 15 years, in 20 years.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:10.940]   - And it's so hard to predict if you'll like it or not
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:12.100]   until you're there.
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:14.260]   - And this is speaking to risk.
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:18.220]   There's not really a good reason for me to move anywhere.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:21.180]   There's not a good reason to do anything in life.
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:25.100]   Part of me wants to just fucking do it
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:25.940]   and whatever and see what happens.
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:27.060]   - Do you like Boston?
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:30.820]   Do you like other things about Boston besides the tech thing?
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:31.660]   You like MIT.
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:33.420]   - At MIT, that's the problem.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:35.340]   - Do you like the food in Boston?
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:36.180]   Do you eat food?
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:39.660]   - I haven't eaten food or been outside for years.
[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:42.940]   - And I mean, that's probably the better version.
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:44.580]   But you're keto forever.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:45.940]   You've been keto for a long time.
[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:49.020]   - Yeah, keto fasting for a long time.
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:54.020]   15 years fasting, eating once or twice a day.
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:55.500]   I haven't--
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:57.420]   - But no sugar ever?
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:58.580]   No like-- - No sugar.
[02:16:58.580 --> 02:16:59.980]   - And no pasta ever?
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:01.180]   No bread ever?
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:02.580]   - No pasta, no bread.
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:06.340]   Except like, so my source of--
[02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:07.500]   - You could kind of live anywhere
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:10.140]   because like going out is such a big part
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:11.260]   of what city you live in.
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:12.500]   And like, do you like the food there?
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:13.380]   Do you like the restaurants?
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:14.420]   Can you meet people, whatever.
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:16.700]   But it's like, you really can just kind of--
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:18.540]   - Yeah, so not married, no kids.
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:19.420]   - Right, you have freedom.
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:21.540]   I'm me too, I have freedom.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:22.380]   - Yeah.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:25.660]   - And that's, we have the curse of too many choices.
[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:26.500]   - Right.
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:27.340]   - That's the thing.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.180]   We have too many choices.
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:29.660]   We don't have somebody else going, what about like,
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.900]   we don't have to justify our decisions to anyone.
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:34.580]   So we can just kind of like let our minds run wild.
[02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:37.500]   - So you just gotta hone the instinct
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:40.980]   of just what feels right and just fucking do it.
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:41.820]   And that's it.
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:42.980]   - I think Austin would show down there and Elon down there.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:46.460]   Austin seems like a real no brainer move for you.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:47.300]   - To try, you know.
[02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:48.540]   - To try. - Why the hell not?
[02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:49.620]   - Why not? - Why not?
[02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:51.520]   - And then I think I should go to MIT.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.180]   (laughing)
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:57.020]   Like, I mean, I think I should give those nerds
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:17:58.020]   a piece of my mind.
[02:17:58.020 --> 02:17:59.660]   - Yeah. - You should go to,
[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:02.620]   I was in a Uber pool once with a kid from MIT
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:05.140]   and I was eating this thing from Bova's Bakery.
[02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:06.060]   I forget what it was.
[02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:08.740]   It was like a, it's so good.
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:09.580]   I don't know.
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:10.700]   You don't know Bova's Bakery, right?
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:12.300]   Yeah, it's in Boston, it's famous.
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:14.260]   I was eating a thing and I was like covered in chocolate.
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:15.500]   This kid, like this little nerd,
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:16.700]   like this little like, you know,
[02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:19.220]   USB drive with feet was just staring at me
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:21.220]   and I just dropped him off at MIT
[02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:22.460]   and he like scurried away.
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.280]   - Yeah.
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:24.120]   - But that's a big school.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.740]   Doesn't the NSA recruit out of their heavy,
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:27.780]   like MIT, places like that?
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:30.460]   - I can't, I can't speak to that.
[02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:34.580]   But what, this is a ridiculous question
[02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:36.660]   I sometimes ask myself when I'm alone.
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:38.780]   What is the meaning of life?
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:41.860]   Do you think about the big existential kinda,
[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:43.220]   why the hell we're here?
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:46.580]   - It's a cosmic kinda joke, kind of in a weird way, right?
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:50.180]   I mean, Joe said it the other day on, maybe it was you,
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:52.620]   saying that like, he was just like, you know,
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:55.340]   by the time you figure out what it is, you're outta here.
[02:18:55.340 --> 02:18:56.660]   You know, it's kind of interesting.
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:18:58.340]   Or you even start to figure out what it is,
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:18:59.180]   you're outta here.
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:00.700]   It's like, that's kinda funny.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:04.740]   It's like, you don't get enough time to truly,
[02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:06.780]   I think the meaning of life is just like,
[02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:12.020]   at the end of the day, do you feel it was time well spent?
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:13.300]   Was it time well spent?
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:16.500]   That's really what it is.
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:20.260]   If you look back, do you go, hey, it was time well spent.
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:21.100]   Like I--
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:21.920]   - Pretty good ride.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.760]   - It was a pretty good ride.
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:25.500]   I did a lot, I did a lot of things.
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:30.500]   I, doing what you say is a part of it, I think.
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.200]   If you say you're gonna do something, maybe doing it.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:38.140]   That seems to be extrapolating the meaning of life question
[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:41.040]   to like, you know, what did you come here to do?
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:43.220]   I think it goes down deep of like, who are you
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:45.060]   and what do you want and, you know,
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:47.460]   what are you suited to do and what--
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:51.340]   - It does seem that like, the people who are most enlightened
[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:54.420]   that I've ever met or read books by,
[02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:56.380]   they ultimately land on humor.
[02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:58.460]   Like they don't take shit seriously.
[02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:01.140]   They embrace the absurdity of it all
[02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:04.860]   and just kind of laugh at it in this kind of simple way.
[02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:08.340]   So it does seem that humor is like,
[02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:11.340]   one of the fundamental truths of this universe.
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:12.180]   - Yes.
[02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.020]   - Wherein, and somehow--
[02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:14.500]   - It's love, it's love.
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:16.920]   Humor can be love, right?
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:20.540]   People laughing, that sound is kind of like,
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:22.260]   Carolyn Knapp, who wrote a book called
[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:25.820]   "Drinking A Love Story," which is a really good book
[02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:29.540]   about not drinking, drinking and then not drinking.
[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:34.540]   And she said the last, you could understand things as love.
[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:36.800]   I think one of the last lines of the thing is like,
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:39.180]   people talking about their experiences in life,
[02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:40.360]   that could be love.
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:41.780]   Like, you know, laughter is love.
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:44.020]   Like I feel like love and finding it
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.420]   wherever you could find it is why we're here.
[02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:49.700]   That's that connection and laughter can be love
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:54.700]   and figuring out something that makes life better
[02:20:54.700 --> 02:20:58.180]   for a lot of people can be love,
[02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:01.820]   whether it's a vaccine or a technological advancement
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.420]   or whatever, like, all of those things,
[02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:06.420]   I think, can be that feeling.
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:07.980]   And I think that's what's important.
[02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:10.480]   It connects you to a larger frequency.
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:13.500]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it, Tim.
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:15.780]   I hope you're one of the voices,
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.620]   I truly believe that your legacy
[02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:20.020]   will be one of the most important voices of our time
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:22.980]   because you're fearless and challenging all the absurdity
[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:27.980]   of the nonsense of our social and political discourse.
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:30.220]   I hope you keep doing it.
[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:33.180]   I'm a fan, I'm still a bit starstruck, so.
[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:37.140]   - Oh, stop it, listen, I thought it was your intellectual
[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:40.340]   capacity, enjoying anything I do,
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:43.180]   only underscores how truly fucked we are.
[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:44.860]   (laughing)
[02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:46.860]   But thank you very much.
[02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:48.140]   - Yeah.
[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:49.220]   - Thank you for talking today.
[02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:50.940]   - Thank you, brother.
