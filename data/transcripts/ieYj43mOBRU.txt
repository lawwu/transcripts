[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   It felt to me for so long, starting a company was like,
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.120]   I'm going to start a thing that's all consuming,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.640]   that's going to be everything to me,
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.360]   and I'm going to work a million hours a day
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.560]   and have thousands of employees, or it's a failure.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.640]   - I love the line, like, don't trade your nine to five
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.640]   for a five to nine.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.680]   The whole point of being an entrepreneur
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.720]   is that you can then become a time millionaire as well,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.840]   where you can spend, like, I'm going to Spain in two weeks.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.240]   If I had a boss who was like, no, you can't travel,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.080]   you got to come to the office,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.320]   but entrepreneurship gives me that affordability.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.400]   And with business, the greatest part about it,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.000]   which people don't recognize is that, yes,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.280]   it does take some effort to get started.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.640]   Yes, you have to find something people are excited
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.880]   to give you money for,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.480]   but you can ultimately spend most of your time,
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.000]   if not all of it, in just the areas you like.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.840]   And guess what?
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.800]   There's people that like doing customer support, like Amy,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   which I don't know how she does it.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.720]   Shout out, Amy, I love you.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.840]   And they're happy there,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.200]   and they get to live their dream lives,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   and that is available.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.280]   It's not such this, like, oh, I've got to spend all night
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.240]   and don't have any free time around it.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.400]   That's what this stuff enables you
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.880]   to have that option available.
