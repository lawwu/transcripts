[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   - So do you think suffering is fundamental
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480]   to happiness along these lines?
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.120]   - Suffering is the result of caring
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.140]   about things that you cannot change.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.800]   And if you are able to change what you care about
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.040]   to those things that you can change, you will not suffer.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.160]   - But would you then be able to experience happiness?
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.280]   - Yes, but happiness itself is not important.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.040]   Happiness is like a cookie.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.200]   When you are a child, you think cookies are very important
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.760]   and you want to have all the cookies in the world
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.360]   and you look forward to being an adult
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.800]   because then you have as many cookies as you want, right?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.640]   - Yes.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.860]   - But as an adult, you realize a cookie is a tool.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.120]   It's a tool to make you eat vegetables.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.600]   And once you eat your vegetables anyway,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360]   you stop eating cookies for the most part
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.120]   because otherwise you will get diabetes
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.560]   and will not be around for your kids.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.080]   - Yes, but then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.400]   if scarcity is enforced, nevertheless,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.560]   so like the pleasure comes from the scarcity.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.840]   - Yes, but the happiness is a cookie
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.800]   that your brain bakes for itself.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.440]   It's not made by the environment.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.880]   The environment cannot make you happy.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.560]   It's your appraisal of the environment
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   that makes you happy.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.080]   And if you can change the appraisal of the environment,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.000]   which you can learn to,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.360]   then you can create arbitrary states of happiness.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.160]   And some meditators fall into this trap.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.200]   So they discover the womb, this basement womb in their brain
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.520]   where the cookies are made,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280]   and they indulge in stuff themselves.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.280]   And after a few months, it gets really old
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.400]   and the big crisis of meaning comes
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.000]   because they thought before that their unhappiness
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.360]   was the result of not being happy enough.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.520]   So they fixed this, right?
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   They can release the neurotransmitters at will
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.720]   if they train.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.440]   And then the crisis of meaning pops up a deeper layer.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.680]   And the question is, why do I live?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.600]   How can I make a sustainable civilization
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.920]   that is meaningful to me?
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.640]   How can I insert myself into this?
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.080]   And this was the problem that you couldn't solve
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.040]   in the first place.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.520]   - But at the end of all this,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080]   let me then ask that same question.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.800]   What is the answer to that?
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.240]   What could the possible answer be of the meaning of life?
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.080]   What could an answer be?
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.720]   What is it to you?
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.120]   - I think that if you look at the meaning of life,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   you look at what the cell is.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.960]   Life is the cell, right?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.800]   - The original cell.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.880]   - Yes, or this principle, the cell.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.160]   It's this self-organizing thing
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.200]   that can participate in evolution.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.600]   In order to make it work, it's a molecular machine.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.880]   It needs a self-replicator,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.380]   a entropy extractor, and a Turing machine.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.680]   If any of these parts is missing,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.040]   you don't have a cell and it is not living, right?
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   And life is basically the emergent complexity
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.560]   over that principle.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.360]   Once you have this intelligent super molecule, the cell,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.040]   there is very little that you cannot make it do.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.440]   It's probably the optimal computronium,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   especially in terms of resilience.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.240]   It's very hard to sterilize the planet
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.680]   once it's infected with life.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.680]   - So it's active function of these three components
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.080]   of the super cell,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.480]   the cell is present in the cell,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   it's present in us, and it's just--
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.240]   - We are just an expression of the cell.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.840]   It's a certain layer of complexity
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   in the organization of cells.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.600]   So in a way, it's tempting to think of the cell
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.120]   as a von Neumann probe.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   If you want to build intelligence on other planets,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.320]   the best way to do this is to infect them with cells.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.800]   And wait for long enough, and there's a reasonable chance
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.080]   the stuff is going to evolve
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200]   into an information processing principle
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.400]   that is general enough to become sentient.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.820]   - Well, that idea is very akin to sort of the same dream
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.280]   and beautiful ideas that are expressed
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.320]   in cellular automata in their most simple mathematical form.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.840]   If you just inject the system with some basic mechanisms
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.000]   of replication and so on, basic rules,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.880]   amazing things would emerge.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.520]   - And the cell is able to do something
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.760]   that James Chardy calls existential design.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.920]   He points out that in technical design,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.120]   we go from the outside in.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.400]   We work in a highly controlled environment
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.800]   in which everything is deterministic,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.640]   like our computers, our labs, or our engineering workshops.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.280]   And then we use this determinism
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.640]   to implement a particular kind of function
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.400]   that we dream up and that seamlessly interfaces
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   with all the other deterministic functions
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.000]   that we already have in our world.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.720]   So it's basically from the outside in.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.600]   And biological systems designed from the inside out,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.160]   as seed, will become a seedling
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.240]   by taking some of the relatively unorganized matter
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.760]   around it and turn it into its own structure,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.520]   and thereby subdue the environment.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.480]   And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.400]   having a similar organization that is already compatible.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   But unless that's there, the cell needs to divide,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200]   to create that structure by itself.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.240]   So it's a self-organizing principle
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.880]   that works on a somewhat chaotic environment.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.720]   And the purpose of life, in a sense,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   is to produce complexity.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.040]   And the complexity allows you
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.640]   to harvest neg-entropy gradients
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.080]   that you couldn't harvest without the complexity.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.120]   And in this sense, intelligence and life
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.500]   are very strongly connected,
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.320]   because the purpose of intelligence
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   is to allow control under conditions of complexity.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.160]   So basically, you shift the boundary
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.640]   between the ordered systems into the realm of chaos.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.060]   You build bridge heads into chaos with complexity.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.620]   And this is what we are doing.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.440]   This is not necessarily a deeper meaning.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.400]   I think the meaning that we have priors for,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.640]   that we are evolved for,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.240]   outside of the priors, there is no meaning.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.600]   Meaning only exists if a mind projects it, right?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.440]   - Yeah, the narrative.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.280]   - That is probably civilization.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.160]   I think that what feels most meaningful to me
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.220]   is to try to build and maintain a sustainable civilization.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.180]   - And taking a slight step outside of that,
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.460]   we talked about a man with a beard and God.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.460]   But something, some mechanism,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.860]   perhaps must have planted the seed,
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.340]   the initial seed of the cell.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.780]   Do you think there is a God?
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.500]   What is a God?
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.940]   And what would that look like?
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.060]   - So if there was no spontaneous abiogenesis,
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.780]   in the sense that the first cell
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.540]   formed by some happy random accidents
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.980]   where the molecules just happen to be
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.420]   in the right constellation to each other.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.940]   - But there could also be the mechanism
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.660]   that allows for the random.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.260]   I mean, there's like turtles all the way down.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.140]   There seems to be,
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.580]   there has to be a head turtle at the bottom.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.260]   - Let's consider something really wild.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.460]   Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.260]   could become intelligent?
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.340]   What would that involve?
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.380]   So imagine that you have vortices
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.700]   that spontaneously emerge on the gas giants,
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.380]   like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.980]   And some of these storm systems
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.220]   produce electromagnetic fields
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.020]   because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.900]   And as a result,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.260]   they can change how certain clouds react
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.420]   rather than other clouds
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.380]   and thereby produce some self-stabilizing patterns
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.600]   that eventually to regulation feedback loops,
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   nested feedback loops and control.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.740]   So imagine you have such a thing
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.020]   that basically has emergent self-sustaining,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.340]   self-organizing complexity.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.580]   And at some point this breaks up
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.020]   and realizes, I'm basically LEM Solaris.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.760]   I am a thinking planet,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.900]   but I will not replicate
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.780]   because I cannot recreate the conditions
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.100]   of my own existence somewhere else.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.100]   I'm just basically an intelligence
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.220]   that has spontaneously formed because it could.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.740]   And now it builds a von Neumann probe.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.500]   And the best von Neumann probe for such a thing
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.660]   might be the cell.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.660]   So maybe it, because it's very, very clever
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.540]   and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.740]   And one of them has infected our planet.
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.380]   And I'm not suggesting that this is the case,
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.820]   but it would be compatible with the Prince Bermion
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.120]   hypothesis and with my intuition
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.400]   that albiogenesis is very unlikely.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.700]   It's possible, but you probably need
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.580]   to roll the cosmic dice very often,
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.740]   maybe more often than there are planetary surfaces.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.580]   I don't know.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.020]   - So God is just a large enough,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.340]   a system that's large enough that allows randomness.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.260]   - No, I don't think that God
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.820]   has anything to do with creation.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.300]   I think it's a mistranslation of the Talmud
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.060]   into the Catholic mythology.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.340]   I think that Genesis is actually
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.340]   the childhood memories of a God.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.860]   So the, when--
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.620]   - Sorry, that Genesis is the--
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.940]   - The childhood memories of a God.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.180]   It's basically a mind that is remembering
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.820]   how it came into being.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.780]   And we typically interpret Genesis
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.420]   as the creation of a physical universe
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.260]   by a supernatural being.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.800]   And I think when you'll read it,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.420]   there is light and darkness that is being created.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.180]   And then you discover sky and ground, create them.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.540]   You construct the plants and the animals,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.820]   and you give everything their names and so on.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.180]   That's basically cognitive development.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.740]   It's a sequence of steps that every mind has to go through
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.980]   when it makes sense of the world.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.800]   And when you have children,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.100]   you can see how initially they distinguish
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.420]   light and darkness.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.340]   And then they make out directions in it,
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.720]   and they discover sky and ground,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.580]   and they discover the plants and the animals,
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   and they give everything their name.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.580]   And it's a creative process that happens in every mind,
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.880]   because it's not given, right?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.060]   Your mind has to invent these structures
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.820]   to make sense of the patterns on your retina.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.660]   Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.580]   and runs this world on it,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.820]   this would not create a special relationship
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.940]   between us and the nerd.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.060]   This nerd would not have the magical power
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.260]   to give meaning to our existence, right?
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.300]   So this equation of a creator God
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.420]   with the God of meaning is a slate of hand.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.860]   You shouldn't do it.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.940]   The other one that is done in Catholicism
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.100]   is the equation of the first mover,
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.220]   the prime mover of Aristotle,
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.100]   which is basically the automaton that runs the universe.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.660]   Aristotle says, "If things are moving,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.060]   "and things seem to be moving here,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.860]   "something must move them," right?
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.120]   If something moves them,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.060]   something must move the thing that is moving it.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.140]   So there must be a prime mover.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.140]   This idea to say that this prime mover
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.220]   is a supernatural being is complete nonsense, right?
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.480]   It's an automaton in the simplest case.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.100]   So we have to explain the enormity
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.260]   that this automaton exists at all.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.220]   But again, we don't have any possibility
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.420]   to infer anything about its properties
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.900]   except that it's able to produce change in information, right?
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.500]   So there needs to be some kind of computational principle.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.660]   This is all there is.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.220]   But to say this automaton is identical, again,
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.860]   with the creator of the first cause
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.700]   or with the thing that gives meaning to our life
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.020]   is confusion.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.660]   No, I think that what we perceive
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.100]   is the higher being that we are part of.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.800]   And the higher being that we are part of
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.380]   is the civilization.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.680]   It's the thing in which we have a similar relationship
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.520]   as the cell has to our body.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.820]   And we have this prior
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.620]   because we have evolved to organize in these structures.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.820]   So basically, the Christian god in its natural form,
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.100]   without the mythology, if you undress it,
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.540]   is basically the platonic form of a civilization.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.540]   - Is the ideal, is the--
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.660]   - Yes, it's this ideal that you try to approximate
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.300]   when you interact with others,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.620]   not based on your incentives,
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.180]   but on what you think is right.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.740]   - Wow, we covered a lot of ground.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.380]   And we're left with one of my favorite lines,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.960]   and there's many, which is,
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   "Happiness is a cookie that the brain bakes itself."
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.260]   It's been a huge honor and a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.760]   I'm sure our paths will cross many times again.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.020]   - Yasha, thank you so much for talking today.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.860]   Really appreciate it. - Thank you, Lex.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.660]   It was so much fun.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.780]   I enjoyed it.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.620]   - Awesome.

[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:32.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
