[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The following is a conversation with Yaron Brook and Yoram Hazony.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   This is Yaron's third time on this podcast and Yoram's first time.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.520]   Yaron Brook is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.640]   host of the Yaron Brook Show and the co-author of Free Market Revolution
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.360]   and Equal is Unfair.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.680]   Yoram Hazony is a national conservatism thinker,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation that hosted the National Conservatism Conference.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.160]   He is also the host of the NatCon Talk
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.440]   and author of The Virtue of Nationalism
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.400]   and an upcoming book called Conservatism, A Rediscovery.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.800]   Allow me to say a few words about each part of the two word title
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.920]   of this episode, Nationalism Debate.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.320]   First, debate.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.520]   I would like to have a few conversations this year that are a kind of debate
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.320]   with two or three people that hold differing views on a particular topic,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.400]   but come to the table with respect for each other and a desire to learn
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.680]   and discover something interesting together through the empathetic
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.560]   exploration of the tension between their ideas.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.040]   This is not strictly a debate.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.840]   It is simply a conversation.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.600]   There is no structure.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.080]   There's no winners, except, of course, just a bit of trash talking to keep it fun.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.760]   Some of these topics will be very difficult,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.040]   and I hope you can keep an open mind and have patience with me
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.880]   as kind of moderator who tries to bring out the best in each person
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.960]   and the ideas discussed.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.280]   OK, that's my comment on the word debate.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880]   Now onto the word nationalism.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.640]   This debate could have been called nationalism versus individualism
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.280]   or national conservatism versus individualism
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.240]   or just conservatism versus individualism.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.200]   As we discuss in this episode,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   these words have slightly different meanings depending on who you ask.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.400]   This is especially true, I think, for any word that ends in -ism.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.960]   I personally enjoy the discussion of the meaning of such philosophical words.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.160]   I don't think it's possible to arrive at a perfect definition
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.680]   that everybody agrees with, but the process of trying to do so
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.760]   for a bit is interesting and productive, at least to me.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.640]   As long as we don't get stuck there, some folks sometimes do.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.040]   In these conversations.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.200]   And now here's my conversation with Yaron Brook and Yoram Hazony.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.360]   I attended the excellent debate between the two of you yesterday at UT Austin.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.640]   The debate was between ideas of conservatism represented by Yoram Hazony
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.000]   and ideas of individualism represented by Yaron Brook.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.760]   Let's start with the topics of the debate.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.360]   Yoram, how do you define conservatism?
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   Maybe in the way you were thinking about it yesterday.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.440]   What to you are some principles of conservatism?
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.920]   Let me define it and then we can we can get into principles if you want.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.840]   When I talk about political conservatism, I'm talking about a political standpoint
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.320]   that regards the recovery, elaboration and restoration of tradition
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.240]   as the key to maintaining a nation and strengthening it through time.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.040]   OK, so this is something that if you have time to talk about it,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.680]   like we do on the show, it's worth emphasizing that conservatism
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.560]   is is not like liberalism or Marxism.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.600]   Liberalism and Marxism are both kind of universal theories,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.560]   and they claim to be able to tell you
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.200]   what's good for human beings at all times, in all places.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.440]   And conservatism is a little bit different because it's going to carry
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.080]   different values in every nation, in every tribe.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.000]   You know, even every family, you can say, has somewhat different values.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.640]   And the these loyalty groups, they compete with one another.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.600]   That's the way human beings work.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.560]   So it's deeply rooted in history of that particular area of land.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.640]   Well, I wouldn't necessarily say land.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.840]   You're right that many forms of conservatism are tied to a particular place.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.280]   So how does the implementation of conservatism to you differ
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.560]   from the ideal of conservatism, the implementations you've seen
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.760]   of political conservatism in the United States and the rest of the world?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.120]   Just to give some context, because it's a loaded term,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.360]   like most political terms.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   So when people think about conservative in the United States,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.800]   they think about the Republican Party.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   What can you kind of disambiguate some of this?
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.920]   What are we supposed to think?
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   Yeah, that's a really important question.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.040]   Usually the word conservative is associated with Edmund Burke
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.720]   and with the English common law tradition.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.040]   Going back, you know, centuries and centuries,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.120]   there's kind of a classical English conservative tradition
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   that goes Fortescue, Hooker,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.320]   Coke, Selden, Hale, Burke, Blackstone before Burke.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.960]   If you take that kind of as a benchmark and you compare it,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.240]   then you can compare it to things like the American Federalist Party
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.520]   at the time of the American founding is in many respects very much
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.880]   very much in keeping with that tradition.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:35.720]   As you go forward, there's an increasing mix of liberalism into conservatism.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.920]   And I think by the time you get to the 1960s
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.400]   with William Buckley and Frank Meyer,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.560]   you know, the jargon term is fusionism.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.760]   By the time you get there,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.520]   it's arguable that their conservatism isn't very conservative anymore,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.760]   that it's kind of a public liberalism mixed with a private conservatism.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   So a lot of the debate that we have today about,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.280]   you know, what does the word conservatism actually mean?
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.200]   A lot of the confusion comes from that, comes from the fact that
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.840]   that on the one hand, we have people who use the term,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.920]   I think, properly historically to refer to this
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.200]   this common law tradition of which Burke was a spokesman.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.640]   But there are lots of other people who when they say conservative,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.520]   they just mean liberal.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.960]   And I think that that's a big problem.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.360]   I mean, it's a problem just to have an intelligent debate is difficult
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.120]   when when people are using the the word almost in too antithetical.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.320]   What would you say the essential idea of conservatism is time?
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.200]   You mentioned your father's a physicist.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.560]   So a lot of physicists, when they form models of the universe,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.320]   they don't consider time.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   So everything is dealt with instantaneously.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.200]   A particle is represented fully by its current state, velocity and position.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   You're saying so you're arguing
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.800]   with all of physics and your father, as we always do,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.000]   that their time matters in conservators.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.960]   That's the fundamental element is the full history matters.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.640]   And you cannot separate the individual from the history,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.880]   from the roots that they come from.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.600]   The parallel in political theory is is what's called rationalism.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.440]   I guess we'll probably talk about that some.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.160]   Rationalism is kind of an instantaneous, timeless thing.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.280]   Before I mentioned that liberalism and various enlightenment theories,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.400]   they don't include time at all.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.120]   Their goal is to say, look, there's such a thing as universal human reason.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.320]   All human beings, if they reason properly, will come to the same conclusions.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.440]   If that's true, then it removes the time consideration.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.640]   It removes tradition and context, because everywhere where you are at any time,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.680]   you ought to be able to use reason and come to the same conclusions
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.400]   about politics or morals.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.720]   So that's a that's a theory like
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.560]   Immanuel Kant or John Locke is an example.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   Hobbes is an example.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.920]   That kind of political theorizing
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.760]   really does say at a given instant,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.040]   we can know pretty much everything that we need to know,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.200]   at least the big things.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   And conservatism is the opposite.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.360]   It's a it's a it's a traditionalist view, exactly as you say,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.200]   that that says that history is crucial.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.840]   So, Yaron, you say that history is interesting,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.160]   but perhaps not crucial if in the context of individualism.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.640]   No, I mean, I think I think there's a false dichotomy he presented here.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.080]   And that is that one view holds that
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.440]   you can derive any anything from a particular historical path
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.600]   and kind of an empirical view.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.280]   And if we know the history, we know where we should be tomorrow.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.480]   We know what what where we should stand today.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.720]   And the other path is we ignore history.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.560]   We ignore facts. We know what's going on.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.040]   We can derive from some a priori axioms.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.240]   We can derive a truth right now.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.440]   And both are false.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.520]   Both of those views, in my view, are false.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.920]   And, you know, I and Rand and I, I reject
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   both of those views.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.080]   And I think the better thinkers of the Enlightenment did as well,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.800]   although they sometimes fall into the trap of appearing like rationalists.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.640]   And, you know, I mean, I agree on one thing, and that is that Kant is is is one of,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.160]   you know, we've we've we've talked about this in the past, Alex.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.760]   But we both hate Kant.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.960]   We both think Kant is is I at least think Kant is probably
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.120]   the most destructive philosopher since Plato,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.680]   who was pretty destructive himself.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.360]   But and part of the problem is that Kant divorces reason from reality.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.960]   That is, he divorces reason from history.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.200]   He divorces reason from experience
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.360]   because we don't have direct experience of reality, according to Kant, right?
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.160]   We're removed from that direct experience.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.360]   But I view Kant as the anti-Enlightenment.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.880]   That is, I view Kant as the destroyer of good Enlightenment thinking.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.240]   And and I acknowledge a lot of history of philosophy.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.200]   The people who do history of philosophy view Kant as the embodiment of the Enlightenment.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.440]   That is the ultimate.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.920]   But but I think that's a mistake.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.480]   I think both Rousseau and Kant are fundamentally the goal.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   The mission in life is to destroy the Enlightenment.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.600]   So my view is neither of those options are the right option.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.920]   That is the true reason based reason is not divorced from reality.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.880]   It's quite the opposite. Reason is a tool.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.360]   It's a faculty of identifying and integrating what it's identifying,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:52.160]   integrating the facts of reality as we know them through sense perception
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   or through the study of history, through what actually happened.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.960]   So it's the integration of those facts.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.640]   It's the knowledge of that history.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.560]   And then what we do is we abstract away principles based on what's worked in the past,
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   what hasn't worked in the past, the consequences of different ideas,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.440]   different paths, different actions.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.960]   We abstract away principles that then can be universal.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.080]   Not always. We make mistakes, right?
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.840]   We can come up with a universal principle.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.360]   It turns out that it's not.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.880]   But if we have the whole scope of human history,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.840]   we can derive principles as we do in life as individuals.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.120]   We derive principles that are then truths that we can live by.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.960]   But you don't do that by ignoring history.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.240]   You do that by learning history, by understanding history,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.320]   by understanding, in a sense, tradition and where it leads to,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.800]   and then trying to do better.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.520]   And I think good thinkers are constantly trying to do better
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.880]   based on what they know about the past and what they know about the present.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.440]   - What's the difference between studying history
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.520]   on a journey of reason and tradition?
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.120]   So you mentioned that Burke understood that reason
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.960]   begins with inherited tradition yesterday.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.520]   So what's the difference between studying history
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.840]   but then being free to go any way you want
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.600]   and tradition where it feels more,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.360]   not, I don't wanna say a negative term like burden,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.800]   but there's more of a momentum
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.760]   that forces you to go the same way as your ancestors?
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.120]   - It's the recognition that people are wrong, often are wrong.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.600]   - Including your parents?
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.040]   - Including your parents, including your teachers,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.280]   including everybody.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.240]   Everybody is potentially wrong.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.760]   And that you can't accept anybody
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.680]   just because they happen to come before you.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   That is, you have to evaluate and judge,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.920]   and you have to have a standard by which to evaluate and judge
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   the actions of those who came before you,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.880]   whether they are your parents,
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.280]   whether they are the state in which you happen to be born,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.560]   whether they are somebody on the other side
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.680]   of planet Earth.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.960]   You can judge them if you have a standard.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.440]   Now my standard, and I think the right standard is,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.360]   human well-being.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.320]   That is, that which is good for human beings,
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.520]   qua human beings, is the standard by which we judge.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.880]   So I can say that certain periods of history were bad.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.560]   They happened, it's important to study them,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.520]   it's important to understand what they did
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.200]   that made them bad, so we cannot do that again.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.920]   And I can say certain cultures,
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.480]   certain periods in time were good.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.320]   Why?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.920]   Because they promoted human well-being
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.160]   and human flourishing.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.000]   That's the standard.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.120]   And then derive from that,
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.040]   okay, what is it that made a particular culture good?
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.960]   What is it that made that particular culture positive
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.160]   in terms of human well-being and human flourishing?
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.240]   What made this bad?
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.840]   And hopefully from that, I can derive a principle.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.080]   Okay, if I want human flourishing
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   and human well-being in the future,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.280]   I wanna be more like these guys and less like those guys.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.360]   I wanna derive what is the principle
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.080]   that will guide me in the future.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.680]   That's, I think, how human knowledge ultimately develops.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.840]   - I think people often make a mistake,
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.800]   just, I'm not saying your own,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.840]   but lots of people don't actually read the original sources.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.600]   And so what happens is people will attack conservatives
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.520]   assuming that conservatives think
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.680]   that whatever comes from the past is right.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.840]   And actually, it's very difficult to find a thinker
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.560]   who actually says something like that.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.400]   Seldon or Burke, the big conservative theorists,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.640]   Hooker, they're all people who understand
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.760]   that the tradition carries with it
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.840]   mistakes that were made in the past.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.280]   And this is actually, I think,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.040]   an important part of their empiricism
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.160]   is that they see the search for truth
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   as something a society does by trial and error.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.000]   And what that means is that in any given moment,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.560]   you have to be aware of the possibility
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.200]   that things that you've inherited
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.640]   are actually false.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.080]   And the job of the political thinker
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.320]   or the jurist or the philosopher
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.160]   is not to dig in and say,
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.000]   whatever it is that we've inherited is right.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.480]   The job is to look at the society as a whole
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.080]   and say, look, we have this job of,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.040]   first of all, conservation,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.160]   just making sure that we don't lose good things
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.760]   that we've had, and second,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.040]   seeing if we can repair things
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.160]   in order to improve them where it's necessary
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.760]   or where it's possible.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   And that process is actually a creative process.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.120]   This is a way in which I think
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.000]   it is similar to Joran's philosophy,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   that you take the inherited tradition
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.380]   and you look for a way that you can shape it
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.320]   in order to make it something better than it was.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.920]   That's a baseline for what we call conservatism.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.760]   - Just a comment.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.720]   So the trial and error,
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.040]   the errors is, you're proud of the errors.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.920]   It's a feature, not a bug.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.400]   So you mentioned trial and error a few times yesterday.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   It's a really interesting kind of idea.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.200]   It's basically accepting that the journey
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.600]   is going to have flaws,
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.160]   as opposed to saying,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.000]   I mean, the conclusion there is the current system is flawed
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.720]   and it will always be flawed.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.560]   - It will always be flawed.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.280]   - And you try to improve it.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.000]   When you listen to your own talk,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.400]   there's much more of a optimism
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.560]   for the system being perfect now
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.520]   or potentially soon, or it could be perfect.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.320]   And to me, the way I heard it is almost like
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.040]   accepting that the system is flawed
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.800]   and through trial and error will improve.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   And Joran says, no, we can have a perfection now.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.320]   - That's the way it sounds to me.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.040]   - Yeah, and I think that's right.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.240]   I think the difference is that at some point,
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.160]   just like in science, I think,
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.200]   one can stop the trial and error
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.160]   and say, I can now see a pattern here.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.040]   I can see that certain actions lead to bad consequences,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.080]   certain actions lead to good consequences.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.440]   Let me try to abstract away what is it that is good
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.520]   and what is it that are bad
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.480]   and build a system around what is good
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.920]   and reject what is bad.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.600]   I think ultimately, if you read the founding fathers
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.120]   and whether we call them conservatives or individuals,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.600]   what the founding fathers actually did,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.120]   all of them, I think, is study history.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.000]   They all did.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.120]   They all talk about history.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.360]   They all talk about examples of other cultures,
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   whether they go back to the Republic in Venice
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   or back to the ancient Greeks.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.680]   So they studied these.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.400]   They learned lessons from them.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.000]   They tried to figure out what has worked in the past
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   and what hasn't and tried to do our principles.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.960]   Now, in my view, they got pretty close
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.240]   to what I would consider kind of an ideal,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.160]   but they didn't get it completely right.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.320]   And here we sit 200 and something years
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.400]   after the Declaration and after the Constitution.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.440]   I think we can look back and say,
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.280]   okay, well, what did they get right?
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.120]   What did they get wrong based on how is it done
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.360]   and where are the flaws and we can improve on it?
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.560]   I think we can get closer to perfection
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.600]   and based on those kind of observations,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.760]   based on that kind of abstraction,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.400]   that kind of discovery of what is true,
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.480]   just like at some point you do the experiments,
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.400]   you do the trial and error,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.800]   and now you come up with a scientific principle.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.000]   It is true that 100 years later,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.360]   you might discover that, hey, I missed something.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.360]   There's something, but to not take the full lesson,
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.920]   to insist on incrementalism,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.320]   to insist on we're just gonna tinker with the system
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.360]   instead of saying, no, there's something really wrong
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.600]   with having a king.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.760]   There's something really wrong
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.880]   with not having any representation,
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.520]   whatever the standard needs to be.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   In the name of we don't wanna move too fast,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.440]   I think is a mistake.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.920]   And the problem with trial and error in politics
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.640]   is that we're talking about human life, right?
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.120]   So there was a big trial around communism
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.720]   and 100 million people paid the price for the trial.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.880]   I could have told them in advance, as did many people,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.400]   that it would not work.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.000]   There are principles of human nature,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.840]   principles that we can study from history,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.040]   principles about economics and other aspects.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.080]   Well, we know it's not gonna work.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.560]   You don't need to try it again.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.880]   We've had communal arrangements throughout history.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   There was an experiment with fascism,
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.240]   and there've been experiments
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.760]   with all kinds of political systems.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.360]   Okay, we've done them.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.320]   Sad that we did them
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.600]   'cause many of us knew they wouldn't work.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.840]   We should learn the lesson.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.200]   And I think that all of history now converges
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.440]   on one lesson,
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.200]   and that is what we need to do
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.760]   is build systems that protect individual freedom.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.880]   That is the core.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.880]   That's what ultimately leads to human flourishing
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.800]   and human success and human achievement.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.080]   And to the extent that we place anything
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.000]   above that individual,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.920]   whether it's the state,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.080]   whether it's the ethnicity,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.160]   whether it's the race,
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.360]   whether it's the bourgeois,
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.480]   whether it's whatever it happens to be,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.560]   a class or whatever,
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.480]   whenever we place something above the individual,
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.520]   the consequence, the negative,
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.440]   that's one of these principles
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.880]   that I think we can derive from studying
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.080]   two, you know, 3,000 years of civilization.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.680]   And it's tragic, I think,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.240]   'cause we're gonna keep experimenting.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.880]   Sadly, I see it, right?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.000]   I'm not winning this battle.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.320]   I'm losing the battle.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.560]   We're gonna keep experimenting
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.040]   with different forms of collectivism,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.080]   and we're gonna keep paying the price in human life
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   and in missed opportunities for human flourishing
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.120]   and human success and human wealth and prosperity.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.960]   - Well, look, if we, let's take communism
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.320]   as a good example.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.280]   None of the major conservative thinkers would say,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.360]   "You know what's a good idea?
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.080]   "A good idea would be to experiment
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.040]   "by raising everything that we've inherited
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.520]   "and starting from scratch."
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   I mean, that's the conservative complaint
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.040]   or accusation against rationalists,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.200]   I mean, as opposed to empiricists.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.000]   I mean, using rationalism,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.040]   let's take, you know,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.440]   let's take Descartes kind of as a benchmark.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.400]   - Can you also maybe define rationalism?
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.840]   - Yeah, these are two terms that are in philosophy,
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.720]   especially in epistemology.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.000]   They're often compared to one another.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.840]   You're on, said that it's a false dichotomy,
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.480]   and maybe it is a bit exaggerated,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.280]   but that doesn't mean it's not useful
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.880]   for conceptualizing the domain.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.760]   So rationalist is somebody like Descartes,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.720]   who says, "I'm going to set aside,
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.040]   "I'm gonna try to set aside everything I know,
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.140]   "everything I've inherited.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.880]   "I'm gonna start from scratch."
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.360]   And he explicitly says,
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.760]   you know, in evaluating the inheritance of the past,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.640]   he explicitly says,
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.600]   "You take a look at the histories that we have.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.480]   "They're not reliable.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.780]   "You take a look at the moral
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.720]   "and the scientific writings that we receive.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.160]   "They're not very good."
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.080]   His baseline is to look very critically at the past
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.360]   and say, "Look, I'm evaluating it.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.440]   "I think all in all, it's just not worth very much.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   "And so whatever I do, beginning from scratch,
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.240]   "is gonna be better as long as,"
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.480]   and here's his caveat,
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.040]   he says, "As long as I'm proceeding
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.200]   "from self-evident assumptions,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.640]   "from self-evident premises,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.200]   "things that you can't argue against."
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.680]   - I think, therefore I am.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.880]   - Right, and then from there,
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.320]   deducing what he calls infallible conclusions.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.560]   So that model of self-evident premises
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.520]   to infallible conclusions,
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.200]   I'm calling that rationalism.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   I think that's kind of a standard academic jargon term.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.520]   And it's opposed to empiricism,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.120]   which is a thinker, I think in universities,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.060]   usually the empiricist is David Hume.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.220]   And David Hume will say,
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.160]   "We can't learn anything the way that Descartes said."
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.520]   I mean, there is nothing that's that self-evident
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.800]   and that infallible.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   So Hume proposes, based on Newton and Boyle
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.000]   and the new physical sciences,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   so Hume proposes a science of man.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.720]   And the science of man sounds an awful lot
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   like what Jeroen just said,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.240]   which is we're gonna take a look at human nature,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.320]   at the nature of societies.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.400]   Human nature, we're gonna try to abstract
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.240]   towards fixed principles for describing it.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.880]   Human societies, we're gonna try to do the same thing.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.640]   And from there we get, for example, contemporary economics,
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.480]   but we also get sociology and anthropology,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.200]   which cut in a different direction.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.960]   So that's rationalism versus empiricism.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.640]   - Can I just say-- - Yeah, go ahead, please.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.480]   - I agree with that.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   I think empiricism, the one thing I disagree is
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.700]   I think empiricism rarely comes to these abstractions.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.400]   I mean, they want more facts.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.720]   It's always about collecting more evidence.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.040]   But this is where I think Ayn Rand is so unusual
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.480]   and where I think there's something new here, right?
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.200]   And that's a bold statement,
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.280]   given the history of philosophy,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.920]   but I think Ayn Rand is something new.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.720]   And so she says, yes, we agree about rationalism
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.860]   and that it's inherently wrong.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.840]   Empiricism has the problem of, okay, where does it lead?
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.360]   You never come to a conclusion.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.160]   You're just accumulating evidence.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.680]   There's something in addition.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.760]   There's a third alternative, which she is positing,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.200]   which is using empirical evidence,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.520]   not denying empirical evidence,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.440]   recognizing that there are some axioms.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.520]   There's some axioms that we all,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.240]   at the base of all of our knowledge,
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.360]   that are starting points.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.180]   We're not rejecting axiomatic knowledge.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.240]   And integrating those two and identifying the fact
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.720]   that based on these axioms
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.920]   and based on these empirical evidence,
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.640]   we can come to truths.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.280]   Just again, like we do in science,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.880]   we have certain axioms, scientific axioms,
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.640]   we have certain experiments that we run,
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.480]   and then we can come to some identification of a truth.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.440]   And that truth is always gonna be challenged
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.600]   by new information, by new knowledge.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.040]   But as long as that's what we know,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.760]   that is what truth.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.560]   So truth is contextual in the sense that it's contextual,
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.440]   it's based on that knowledge that surrounds it.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.080]   - And it's a for to change if you get new facts.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.320]   - Absolutely, it's always available to change
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.600]   if the facts that you get, and they really are.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.560]   I mean, the burden of changing what you've come to,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.920]   a conclusion of truth is high,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.180]   so you'd have to have real evidence that it's not true.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.160]   But that happens all the time.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.680]   So it happens in science, right?
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   We discover that what we thought was true is not true.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.720]   And it can happen in politics and ethics,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.920]   even more so than in science,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.240]   'cause they're much messier fields.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.440]   But the idea is that you can come to a truth,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   but it's not just deductive.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.640]   Most truths are inductive.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.960]   We learn from observing reality,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   and again, coming to principles
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.640]   about what works and what's not.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.800]   And here I think this is, Ayn Rand is different.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.400]   She doesn't fall into the,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.880]   and she's different in her politics,
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.400]   and she's different in her epistemology.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.480]   She doesn't fall into the conventional view.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.360]   She's an opponent of Hume,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.400]   and she's an opponent of Descartes.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.200]   She's certainly an opponent of Kant.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.040]   And I think she's right.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   - If it's okay, can we walk back to criticism of communism?
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.320]   You're both critics of communism, socialism.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.040]   Why did communism fail?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.280]   You started to say that conservatives criticize it
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.160]   on the basis of rationalism,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.560]   that you're throwing away the past.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   You're starting from scratch.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.000]   Is that the fundamental description
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.440]   of why communism failed?
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.200]   - I think the fundamental difference
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.320]   between rationalists and empiricists
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.840]   is the question of whether you're throwing away the past.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.520]   That's the argument.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.960]   And it caches out as a distinction
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   between abstract, universal, rationalist, political theories
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.920]   and empirical political theories.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.760]   Empirical political theories are,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.040]   they're always going to say something like,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.280]   look, there are many different societies.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.720]   We can say that some are better and some are worse,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   but the problem is that there are many different ways
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.560]   in which a society can be better or worse.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.720]   There's an ongoing competition,
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   and we're learning on an ongoing basis
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.120]   what are the ways in which societies
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.520]   can be better and worse.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.200]   That creates a kind of, I'd say, a mild skepticism,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.560]   a moderate skepticism among conservatives.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.000]   I don't think too many conservatives
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   have a problem looking at the Soviet Union,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.360]   which is brutal and murderous, ineffective in its economics,
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.960]   totally ineffective spiritually, and then collapsed.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.240]   Okay, so I think it's easier for us
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.400]   to look at a system like that and say,
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.280]   what on earth, what should we learn from that?
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.800]   But the main conservative tradition
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.760]   is pretty tolerant of a diversity
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.640]   of different kinds of society,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.000]   and is slow to insist that France is so tyrannical
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.120]   it just needs a revolution
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.720]   because what's gonna come after the revolution
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.040]   is gonna be much better.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.280]   The assumption is that there's lots of things
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.880]   that are good about most societies,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.800]   and that a clean slate leads you
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.920]   to throw out all of the inherited things
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.120]   that you don't even know how to notice until they're gone.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.040]   - Could I actually play devil's advocate here
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.920]   and address something you also said?
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.200]   Can we, as opposed to knowing the empirical data
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.120]   of the 20th century that communism presented,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.720]   can we go back to the beginning of the 20th century?
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.320]   Can you empathize or steel man
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.800]   or put yourself in a place of the Soviet Union
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.360]   where the workers are being disrespected?
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.540]   And can you not see that the conservatives
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.180]   could be pro-communism?
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.480]   - Like communism is such a strongly negative word
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.640]   in modern day political discourse
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.000]   that you can't, like you have to put yourself
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   in the mind of people who like red colors,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.680]   who like-- - That's what it was.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.800]   - It was, it's all about the branding, I think.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.280]   Just, but also like the ideas of solidarity,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   of nation, of togetherness, of respect for fellow man.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.280]   I mean, all of these things that communism represents,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.080]   can you not see that this idea
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.640]   is actually going along with conservatism?
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.480]   It is in some ways respecting the deep ideals of the past,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.680]   but proposing a new way to raise those ideals,
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.000]   implement those ideals in the system.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.480]   - Yes, I'm gonna try to do what you're suggesting,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.000]   but historically we actually have a more useful option,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.620]   I think, for both of our positions.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.280]   Instead of pretending that we like the actual communists,
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.160]   we have conservative statesmen like Disraeli and Bismarck
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.840]   who initiated social legislation, right?
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.440]   The first step towards saying,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.160]   "Look, we're one nation,
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.600]   we're undergoing industrialization."
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.120]   That industrialization is important and positive,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.600]   but it's also doing a lot of damage to a lot of people.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.260]   And in particular, it's doing damage
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.360]   not just to individuals and families,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.920]   but it's doing damage to the social fabric,
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.260]   the capacity of Britain or German
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.320]   to remain cohesive societies is being harmed.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.040]   And so it's these two conservative statesmen,
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.580]   Disraeli and Bismarck, who actually take the first steps
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.720]   in order to legislate for what today we would consider
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.260]   to be minimal social programs,
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.880]   pensions and disability insurance and those kinds of things.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.700]   So for sure, conservatives do look at industrialization
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.240]   as a rapid change, and they say,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.920]   "We do have to care about the nation as a whole,
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.280]   and we have to care about it as a unity."
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.560]   And I assume that your own will say,
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.800]   "Look, that's the first step
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.300]   towards the catastrophe of communism."
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.080]   But before your own drives that nail into the coffin,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.960]   let me try to make a distinction.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.400]   Because when you read Marx,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.160]   you're reading an intellectual descendant of Descartes.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.900]   You're reading somebody who says,
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:24.880]   "Look, every society consists of oppressors and oppressed."
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.040]   And that's an improvement in some ways over liberal thinking
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.200]   because at least he's seeing groups
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.120]   as a real social phenomenon.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.480]   But he says, "Every society has an oppressor class
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.820]   and oppressed class.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.520]   There are different classes, there are different groups,
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.040]   and whenever one is stronger,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.560]   it exploits the ones that are weaker."
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.800]   All right, that is the foundation
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.840]   of a revolutionary political theory.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.680]   Why?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.080]   Because the moment that you say
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   that the only relationship between the stronger
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.480]   and the weaker is exploitation,
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.280]   the moment that you say that,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.200]   then you're pushed into the position,
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.840]   and Marx and Engels say this explicitly.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.560]   You're pushed into the position where you're saying,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   "When will the exploitation end?
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.220]   Never until there's a revolution.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.600]   What happens when there's a revolution?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.800]   You eliminate the oppressor class.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.200]   It's annihilationist."
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.400]   I mean, you can immediately, when you read it,
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.040]   see why it's different from Descartes or Bismarck
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.760]   because they're trying to keep everybody
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.240]   somehow at peace with one another,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.620]   and Marx is saying, "There is no peace.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.080]   That oppressor class has to be annihilated."
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.720]   And then they go ahead and do it,
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.320]   and they kill 100 million people.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.400]   So I do think that despite the fact
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.100]   your question is good and right,
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.520]   there are certain similarities in concern,
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.240]   but still, I think you can tell the difference between those.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.120]   - That extra step of revolution to you
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.760]   is where the problem comes.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.260]   Like that extra step of let's kill all the oppressors,
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.760]   that's the problem.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.680]   And then to you, you're on,
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.400]   the whole step one is the problem.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.920]   - Well, it's all a problem.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   First, I don't view communism as something that radical
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.560]   in a sense that I think it comes
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.080]   from a tradition of collectivism.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.640]   I think it comes from a tradition of looking at groups
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.100]   and measuring things in terms of groups.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.180]   It comes from a tradition where you expect
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.520]   some people to be sacrificed
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.880]   for the greater good of the whole.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.020]   I think it comes from a tradition
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.720]   where mysticism or revelation
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.880]   as the source of truth is accepted.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.860]   I view Marx as, in some sense, very Christian.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.600]   I don't think he's this radical rejecting,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.660]   I think he's just reformatting.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.180]   Christianity in a sense,
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.200]   he's replacing God with the proletarian.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.100]   Knowledge, you have to get knowledge from somewhere.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.420]   So you need the dictatorship of the proletarian,
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.460]   you need somebody, the Stalin, the Lenin,
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.140]   who somehow communes with the spirit,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.860]   the spirit of the proletarian.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.360]   There's no rationality, not rationalism,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.540]   there's no rationality in Marx.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.060]   There is a lot of mysticism
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.540]   and there is a lot of hand-waving
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.940]   and there's a lot of sacrifice
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.220]   and a lot of original sin
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.660]   in the way he views humanity.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.220]   So I view Marx as one more collectivist
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.860]   in a whole string of collectivists.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.900]   And I think the Bismarckian response,
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.500]   which Bismarck, I mean, I know less about the Israelis,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.860]   so I'll focus on Bismarck.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.380]   I mean, Bismarck is really responding
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.420]   to political pressures from the left
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:32.420]   and he's responding to the rise of communism, socialism.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.740]   But what Bismarck is doing,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.540]   he's putting something alternative,
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.780]   he's presenting an alternative to the proletarian
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.980]   as the standard by which we should matter the good.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.300]   And what he's replacing it as the state,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.820]   he's replacing the proletarian with the state.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.300]   And that has exactly the same problems.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.760]   That is, first, it requires sacrificing some to others,
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.840]   which is what the welfare state basically legitimizes.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.580]   It places the state above all,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.860]   so the state now becomes, I think,
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.380]   the biggest evil of Bismarck.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.740]   And I definitely view him as a negative force in history.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.540]   Is public education.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.620]   I mean, the Germans really dig in on public education
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.780]   and really develop it.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.020]   And really, the American model of public education
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.140]   is copying the German, the Prussian,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.980]   Bismarckian public education.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.620]   - Can you speak to that real quick,
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.060]   why the public education is such a root
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.780]   of moral evil for you?
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.180]   - Well, because it now says that there's one standard,
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.540]   and that standard is determined by government,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.140]   by a bureaucracy, by whatever the government deems
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.620]   as in the national interest.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.140]   And Bismarck's very explicit about this.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   He's training the workers of the future.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.540]   They need to catch up with England and other places,
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.660]   and they need to train the workers.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.820]   And there's gonna be a,
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.060]   he's gonna train some people to be the managerial class,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.500]   he's gonna train other people to be,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.420]   and he decides, right, the government,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.580]   the bureaucracy is gonna decide who's who,
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.420]   and where they go.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.580]   There's no individual choice.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.020]   There's no individual showing an ability to break out
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.540]   of what the government has decided is their little box.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.020]   There's very little freedom.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.060]   There's very little, you know,
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.020]   ultimately there's very little competition.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.740]   There's very little innovation.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.900]   And this is the problem we have today in American education,
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.940]   which we can get to,
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.700]   is there's no competition and no innovation.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.220]   We have one standard fit all,
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   and then we have conflicts about what should be taught.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.540]   And the conflicts now are not pedagogical.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.220]   They're not about what works and what doesn't.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.740]   Nobody cares about that.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.340]   It's about political agendas, right?
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.820]   It's about what my group wants to be taught
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.420]   and what that group wants to be taught,
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.740]   rather than actually discovering,
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.940]   how do we get kids to read?
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.460]   I mean, we all know how to get kids to read,
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.980]   but there's a political agenda
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.020]   about not teaching phonics, for example.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.380]   So a lot of schools don't teach phonics,
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.140]   even though the kids will never learn how to read properly.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.860]   So it becomes politics,
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.420]   and I don't believe politics belongs in education.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.020]   I think education is a product, it's a service,
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.180]   and we know how to deliver products and services
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.940]   really, really efficiently at a really, really low price
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.340]   at a really, really high quality,
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.660]   and that's leaving it to the market to do.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.220]   - But your fundamental criticism
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.780]   is that the state can use education
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.420]   to further its authoritarian aims.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.980]   - Well, or whatever the aims.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.980]   I mean, think about the conservative today
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.820]   critique of American educational system, right?
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.140]   It's dominated by the left.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.860]   Yeah, what did you expect, right?
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.820]   If you leave it up to the state to fund,
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.180]   they're gonna fund the things that promote state growth
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.580]   and state intervention, and the left is better at that.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.620]   It has been better at that than the right,
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.740]   and they now dominate our educational institutions.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.420]   But look, if we go back to Bismarck,
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.500]   my problem is placing the state above the individual.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.700]   So if communism places the class above the individual,
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.420]   what matters is class, individuals are nothing,
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.180]   they're cogs in a machine.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.660]   Bismarck, certainly the German tradition,
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.900]   much more than the British tradition
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:53.820]   or the American tradition,
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.020]   the German tradition is to place the state
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.020]   above the individual.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.780]   I think that's equally evil, and the outcome is fascism,
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.020]   and the outcome is the same.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.580]   The outcome is the deaths of tens of millions of people
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.940]   when taken to its ultimate conclusion,
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.100]   just like socialism, the ultimate conclusion of it
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.540]   is communism, you know, nationalism,
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.740]   in that form, kind of the Bismarckian form,
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:19.300]   the ultimate conclusion is Nazism or some form of fascism.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.660]   Because you don't care about the individual,
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.860]   the individual doesn't matter.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.820]   I think this is one of the differences
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.820]   in the Anglo-American tradition,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.660]   where the Anglo-American tradition,
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.780]   even the conservatives have always acknowledged,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.700]   and it goes back to--
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.180]   - Especially the conservatives.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.700]   The conservatives were there first.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.180]   - They acknowledged.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.820]   Well, you've defined conservatives
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.260]   to include all the good thinkers of the distant past,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.620]   and they're all good thinkers, we agree on that.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.420]   I'm defining conservatism the way that Burke does.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.700]   Look, this is a very simple observation.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.660]   Burke thinks, when you open Burke and you actually read him,
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.260]   he starts naming all of these people who he's defending,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.660]   and it's bizarre, I'm sorry,
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.660]   it's just intellectual sloppiness
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.620]   for people to be publishing books called
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.860]   Burke, the first conservative, the founding conservative.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.620]   I mean, this is nonstop.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:15.020]   It's a view that says Burke reacts to the French Revolution,
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.820]   so conservatism has no prior tradition,
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.700]   it's just reacting to the French Revolution,
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.060]   and this is just absurd.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.580]   - Can I ask a quick question on conservatism?
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.980]   Are there any conservatives
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.380]   that are embracing of revolutions?
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.780]   So are they ultimately against the concept of revolution?
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.740]   - Yes, Burke himself embraces the Polish Revolution,
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.860]   which takes place almost exactly at the same time
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.460]   as the French Revolution,
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.820]   and the argument's really interesting,
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.540]   because a common mistake is assuming
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.260]   that Burke and conservative thinkers
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.820]   are always in favor of slow change.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.980]   I think that's also just factually mistaken.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.340]   Burke is against the French Revolution
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.740]   because he thinks that there are actually
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.580]   tried and true things that work,
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.140]   things that work for human flourishing,
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.460]   and freedom included as a very important part
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.540]   of human flourishing.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.700]   He, like many others, takes the English Constitution
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.100]   to be a model of something that works.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.820]   So it has a king, it has various other things
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.380]   that maybe your own will say, "Well, that's a mistake,"
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.180]   but still, for centuries, it's the leader
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.740]   in many things that I think we can easily agree
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.140]   are human flourishing.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.900]   And Burke says, "Look, what's wrong
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.880]   "with the French Revolution?
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.160]   "What's wrong with the French Revolution
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   "is that they have a system that has all sorts of problems,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.780]   "but they could be repairing it,
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.100]   "and instead what they're doing by overthrowing everything
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.360]   "is they're moving away from what we know
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.300]   "is good for human beings."
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.460]   Then he looks at the Polish Revolution,
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.040]   and he says, "The Poles do the opposite.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.900]   "The Poles have a non-functioning traditional constitution.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.820]   "It's too democratic.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:01.820]   "It's impossible to raise armies and to defend the country
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.580]   "because of the fact that every nobleman has a veto."
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.940]   So the Polish Revolution moves in the direction
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.300]   of the British Constitution.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.500]   They repair their constitution
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.340]   through a quick, a rapid revolution.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.620]   They install a king along the model
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.140]   that looks a lot like Britain, and Burke supports this.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.860]   He says, "This is a good revolution."
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   So it's not the need to quickly make a change
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.940]   in order to save yourself.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.140]   That's not what conservatives are objecting to.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.840]   What they're objecting to is instead of looking at experience
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.900]   in order to try to make a slow or quick improvement,
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.160]   a measured improvement to achieve a particular goal,
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.100]   instead of doing that, you say,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.400]   "Look, the whole thing has just been wrong,
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.380]   "and what we've really got to do is annihilate
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.700]   "a certain part of the population
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.180]   "and then make completely new laws
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.020]   "and a completely new theory."
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.340]   That's what he's objecting to.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.100]   That's the French Revolution, and that then becomes
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.540]   the model for communist revolutions.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.220]   - And for me, I mean, the French Revolution
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.140]   is clearly a real evil and wrong,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.000]   but it's not that it was a revolution,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.800]   and it's not that it tried to change everything.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.140]   I mean, let's remember what was going on
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.420]   in France at the time, and people were starving,
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.340]   and the monarchy in particular was completely detached,
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.220]   completely detached from the suffering of the people,
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.400]   and something needed to change.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   The unfortunate thing is that the change was motivated
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.460]   by an egalitarian philosophy, not egalitarian in the sense
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.260]   that I think the founding fathers talked about it,
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.020]   but egalitarian in the sense of real equality,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.100]   equality of outcome, motivated by a philosophy,
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.380]   by Rousseau's philosophy, and inevitably,
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.500]   you could tell that the ideas were going to lead to this,
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.420]   to massive destruction and death
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.620]   and the annihilation of a class.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.440]   You can't, annihilation is never an option.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.940]   That is, it's not true that a good revolution
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.060]   never leads to mass death of just whole groups of people
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.340]   because a good revolution is about the sanctity
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.700]   of the individual, it's about preservation
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.540]   of liberty of the individual.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.540]   And again, that goes back to,
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:08.700]   and the French Revolution denies,
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.260]   and Rousseau denies really, that in civilization,
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.620]   there is a value and a thing called the individual.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:18.020]   - I think this is a good place to have this discussion.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.220]   The founding fathers of the United States,
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:26.100]   are they individualists or are they conservatives?
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:30.020]   So in this particular revolution that founded this country,
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.020]   at the core of which are some fascinating,
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.980]   some powerful ideas, were those founding fathers,
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.420]   were those ideas coming from a place of conservatism
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:44.900]   or did they put primary value into the freedom
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.420]   and the power of the individual?
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.500]   What do you think?
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.540]   - They were both.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.860]   I mean, this is something that's a little bit difficult
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.180]   sometimes for Americans, I mean,
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.700]   even very educated Americans,
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.100]   they talk about the founding fathers
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.420]   as though it's kind of like this--
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.260]   - On with.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.780]   - This collective entity with a single brain
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.460]   and a single value system,
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.340]   but I think at the time, that's not the way they,
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.340]   not the way any of them saw it.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.260]   So roughly there's two camps,
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.220]   and they map onto the rationalist
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.220]   versus traditionalist empiricist dichotomy
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.860]   that I proposed earlier.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.620]   And so on the one hand,
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.820]   you have real revolutionaries like Jefferson and Paine.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.260]   These are the people who Burke was writing against.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.620]   These are the people who supported the French Revolution.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.580]   - So when you say real, so when you say Paine,
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.020]   you're referring to revolutionaries in a bad way,
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.220]   like this is a problem.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.100]   - These are people who will say,
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:46.740]   history up until now has been,
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.740]   with Descartes, but applied to politics,
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.260]   history up until now has been just a story
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.380]   of ugliness, foolishness, stupidity, and evil.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.460]   And if you apply reason,
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.740]   we'll all come to roughly,
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.380]   we'll all come to the same conclusions.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.620]   You know, and Paine writes a book called "The Age of Reason,"
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.020]   and "The Age of Reason" is a manifesto for,
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.260]   here is the answer to political and moral problems
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.140]   throughout history.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.540]   We have the answers.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.940]   And it's in the same school as Rousseau's "The Social Continent."
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.620]   No, you don't like that?
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.460]   - Not at all.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.300]   - Oh, I thought it was opposite.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.140]   - I think they're the opposite.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.980]   - Okay, so let me--
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.260]   Just to throw in a question on Jefferson and Paine,
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.700]   do you think America would exist without those two figures?
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.820]   So like, how important is spice
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.940]   in the flavor of the dish you're making?
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.060]   - I don't wanna try to run the counterfactual.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.620]   I don't have confidence
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.220]   that I know the answer to the question.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.940]   - But it's so much fun.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.860]   - You know what, I'm gonna offer something
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.020]   that I think is more fun.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.580]   More fun than the counterfactual is,
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.820]   America had two revolutions,
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.340]   not one, okay?
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.540]   At first, there is a revolution
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:03.540]   that is strongly spiced with this kind of rationalism.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.060]   And then there's a 10-year period
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.260]   after the Declaration of Independence.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:10.420]   There's a 10-year period
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.740]   under which America has a constitution,
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.060]   its first constitution,
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.220]   which today they call the Articles of the Confederation.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.260]   But there's a constitution from 1777.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.620]   And that constitution is based on,
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.700]   in a lot of ways, on the hottest new ideas.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.660]   It has, instead of the traditional British system
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.340]   with a division of powers
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.260]   between an executive and a bicameral legislature,
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.140]   instead of that traditional English model,
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.380]   which most of the states had as their governments,
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.660]   instead of that, they say,
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:46.660]   "No, we're gonna have one elected body, okay?
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.740]   And that body, that Congress,
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.300]   it's going to be the executive.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.780]   It's going to be the legislative.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.740]   It's going to be everything,
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.180]   and it's gonna run as a big committee."
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.500]   These are the ideas of the French Revolution.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:02.060]   You get to actually see them implemented in Pennsylvania,
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.860]   in the Pennsylvania Constitution,
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.620]   and then later in the National Assembly in France.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.780]   It's a disaster.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.020]   The thing doesn't work.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.180]   It's completely made up.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.580]   It's not based on any kind.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.660]   It's neither based on historical experience,
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.420]   nor is it based on historical custom,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.060]   on what people are used to.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.060]   And what they succeed in creating
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.780]   with this first constitution
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.220]   is it's wonderfully rational,
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.740]   but it's a complete disaster.
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.340]   It doesn't allow the raising of taxes.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.180]   It doesn't allow the mustering of troops.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.500]   It doesn't allow giving orders to soldiers to fight a war.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.860]   And if that had continued,
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.780]   if that had continued to be the American Constitution,
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.580]   America never would have been an independent country.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.020]   They aren't willing to do that counterfactual.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.460]   What happens during those years
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.460]   where Washington and Jay and Knox
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.740]   and Hamilton and Morris,
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.780]   there's like this group of conservatives.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.300]   They're mostly soldiers and lawyers.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.220]   Other than Washington,
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.340]   most of them are from Northern cities.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.020]   And this group is much more conservative
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:14.860]   than the Tom Paine and Jefferson School.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.780]   Some historians call them the Nationalist Party.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.700]   Historically, they give up the word nationalism
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.260]   and they call themselves the Federalists,
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.220]   but they're basically the Nationalist Party.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.260]   What does that mean?
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.940]   It means on the one hand,
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.060]   that their goal is to create an independent nation,
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.220]   independent from Britain.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.700]   But on the other hand,
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.500]   they believe that they already have
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.820]   national legal traditions,
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.980]   the common law,
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.300]   the forms of government that have been imported from Britain
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.740]   and of course, Christianity,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.980]   which they consider to be part of their inheritance.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.980]   This Federalist Party is the conservative party.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.140]   These are people who are extremely close in ideas to Burke.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.620]   And these are people who wrote
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.060]   the Constitution of the United States,
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.340]   the second constitution,
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.100]   the second revolution in 1787,
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.580]   when Washington leads the establishment
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.620]   of a new constitution,
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.140]   which maybe technically, legally,
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.820]   it wasn't even legal under the old constitution,
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.380]   but it was democratic.
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.980]   And what it did is it said,
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:24.060]   we're going to take what we know about English government,
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.740]   what we've learned by applying English government
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.580]   in the States,
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.100]   we're gonna create a national government,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.860]   a unified national government
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.700]   that's going to muster power in its hands,
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.660]   enough power to be able to do things
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.540]   like fighting wars to defend a unified people.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.100]   Those are conservatives.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.540]   Now, it's reasonable to say,
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.900]   well, look, there was no king,
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.260]   so how conservative could they be?
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.900]   But I think that's a reasonable question.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.180]   But don't forget that the American colonies,
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.740]   the English colonies in America,
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.580]   by that point had been around for 150 years.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.420]   They had written constitutions.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.620]   They had already adapted for an entire century,
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.420]   adapted the English constitution to local conditions
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.140]   where there's no aristocracy and there's no king.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.620]   I think you can see that as a positive thing.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.940]   On the other hand, they have slavery.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.340]   That's an innovation.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.860]   That's not English.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.060]   So it's a little bit different
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.140]   from the English constitution,
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.180]   but those men are conservatives.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.780]   They make the minimum changes that they need
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.900]   to the English constitution,
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.960]   and they largely replicate it,
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.600]   which is why the Jeffersonians hated them so much.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.140]   They called them apostates.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.180]   They say they've betrayed equality and liberty
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.300]   and fraternity by adopting an English-style constitution.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.980]   - So I would imagine, Aaron,
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.260]   you would put emphasis of the success of the key ideas
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.540]   at the founding of this country elsewhere,
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.380]   at the freedom of the individual,
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.500]   so as opposed to the tradition of the British Empire.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.260]   - I mean, the one thing I agree with you on
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.900]   is the fact that, yes,
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.700]   the founding fathers were not a monolith.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.100]   I mean, they argued, they debated, they disagreed,
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.820]   they wrote against each other.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.300]   I mean, Jefferson and Adams for decades
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.380]   didn't even speak to each other,
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.940]   though they did make up
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.980]   and had a fascinating relationship.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.260]   - You and I are making up, too.
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.660]   (both laughing)
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.220]   It's like the founding fathers.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:17.220]   - There's massive debate and discussion,
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.180]   but I don't agree with the characterization
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.940]   of Paine and Jefferson.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.180]   I don't think it's just to call them rationalists,
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.020]   'cause I don't think they're rationalists.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.620]   People who've looked at history,
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.740]   at the problems in history,
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.300]   and remember, this is the 18th century,
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:34.060]   and we're coming out of 100 years earlier,
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.180]   some of the bloodiest wars in all of human history
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.980]   were happening in Europe.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.580]   Many of them over religion.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.580]   They'd seen what was going on in France
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.700]   and other countries where people were starving
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:53.140]   and where kings were frolicking in palaces in spite of that.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.940]   They were very aware of the relative freedom
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:01.740]   that the British tradition had given Englishmen.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.780]   I think they knew that, they understood that,
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.300]   and I think they were building on that.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.220]   They were taking the observation of the past
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:12.460]   and trying to come up with a more perfect system,
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.820]   and I think they did.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.620]   In that sense, I'm a huge fan of Jefferson.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.500]   There are two things that I think
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.860]   are unfortunate about Jefferson.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.100]   One is that he continued to hold slaves,
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.940]   which is very unfortunate,
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.100]   and the second is early support
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:28.980]   for the French Revolution,
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.220]   which I think is a massive mistake,
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.140]   and I wouldn't be surprised if he regretted it
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.500]   later in life given the consequences.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.460]   But they were trying to derive principles
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.740]   by which they could establish a new state,
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:45.620]   and yes, there was pushback by some,
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   and there was disagreement,
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.980]   and the Constitution in the end
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.980]   is to some extent a form of compromise.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.220]   It's still one of the great documents
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.660]   of all of human history, political documents,
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.540]   the Constitution, although I think
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.940]   it's inferior to the Declaration.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.980]   I'm a huge fan of the Declaration,
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.340]   and I think one of the mistakes the Conservatives makes,
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.620]   one of the mistakes the Supreme Court makes
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.660]   and American judiciary makes
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.340]   is assuming the two documents are separate.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.820]   I think Lincoln is absolutely right.
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.420]   You can't understand the Constitution
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.340]   without understanding the Declaration,
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:17.180]   the Declaration, what set the context
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.900]   and what sets everything up for the Constitution.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.780]   Individual rights are the key concept there,
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.940]   and one of the challenges was
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.420]   that some of the compromises,
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.700]   and compromises not necessarily between groups,
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.500]   but compromises that even Jefferson made
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.940]   and others made regarding individual rights
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.860]   set America on a path that we're suffering from today,
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.780]   and I mentioned three last night.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.140]   One was slavery.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.420]   Obviously, that was a horrific compromise,
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.460]   one that America not just paid for with the Civil War,
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.260]   600,000 young men died because of it,
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.900]   but the suffering of black slaves for all those years,
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.660]   but then the whole issue of racial tensions
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.180]   in this country for a century,
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.940]   and to this day really,
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.180]   is a consequence of that initial compromise.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:11.540]   Who knows what the counterfactual is in America
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.260]   if there's a Civil War right at the founding,
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.420]   'cause there would have been a war no matter what,
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.380]   but if it had happened in the late 18th century,
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.820]   early 19th century, rather than waiting 'til 1860s,
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:26.820]   but then second was Jefferson's embrace of public education,
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:30.420]   his founding of the University of Virginia,
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.540]   which I think is a great tragedy,
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.740]   which nobody agrees with me on,
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.900]   so that's one of the areas where I'm pretty radical,
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:43.060]   and then the embrace, both by Jefferson and by Hamilton,
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:46.660]   for different reasons, but an embrace by both of them
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.060]   of government role in the economy,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.500]   and I do finance, so I know a little bit about finance,
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.580]   and the debate between Jefferson and Hamilton
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.700]   about banking is fascinating,
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.700]   but at the end of the day,
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.700]   both wanted a role for government in banking.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.700]   They both didn't trust.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.780]   Jefferson didn't trust big financial interests.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.060]   Hamilton wanted to capture some of those financial interests
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.220]   for the state, and as a consequence,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.180]   we set America on a path where, in my view,
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.900]   regulation always leads to more regulation.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.220]   There's never a case where regulation decreases,
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.220]   and we started out with a certain regulatory body
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.660]   around banks and a recognition
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.540]   that it was okay to regulate the economy,
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:25.300]   so once we get into the late 19th century,
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.140]   it's fine to regulate the railroads,
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.340]   it's fine to pass antitrust laws,
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.620]   it's fine to then continue on the path
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.580]   of where we are today, which is heavy, heavy, heavy,
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.740]   massive involvement of government in every aspect
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.740]   of our economy and really in every aspect of our life
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.500]   because of education, so I think the country
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.940]   was founded on certain mistakes,
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.260]   and we haven't been willing to question those mistakes,
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:52.060]   and in a sense, we've only moved in the opposite direction,
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.740]   and now America's become, whereas I think it was founded
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.500]   on the idea of the primacy of the individual,
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.300]   the sanctity of the individual,
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.900]   at least as an idea, even if not fully implemented,
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.460]   I think now that's completely lost.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:08.740]   I don't think anybody really is an advocate out there
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.940]   for individualism in politics
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.820]   or for true freedom in politics.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.420]   - We'll get to individualism, but let me ask the Beatles
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.580]   and the Rolling Stones question about the Declaration
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.340]   of Independence and the Constitution.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.180]   - Who's the Stone?
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.980]   - Well, 'cause it's like which document,
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.580]   Beatles or Rolling, which document is more important?
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:25.660]   - It's obviously the Beatles, right?
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.340]   - Okay. - Is the question?
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.500]   Is there even a question?
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.260]   But let me then even zoom in further
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.940]   and ask you to pick your favorite song.
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.700]   So what ideas in the Constitution
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.020]   or the Declaration of Independence do you think
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.340]   are the most important to the success
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.100]   of the United States of America?
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.180]   - I'll answer the question,
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.100]   but before answering the question,
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:49.100]   I wanna dissent from, register a dissent from your own.
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.580]   - Is it the public education?
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.540]   Is it which?
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:55.020]   - No, no, no, actually, look, we're not so far apart
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.860]   on public education.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.700]   I'm actually kind of surprised that you're so anti-Bismarck
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.860]   because his public school system,
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.700]   his national public school system was created
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.100]   in order to stick it to the church.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.580]   It was the church that ran the schools before then.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.100]   And okay, but so that's a different--
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.300]   - I'm all for sticking it to the church.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.140]   - You're right, I know.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.980]   - If there's any opportunity,
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.980]   but not when the alternative is the nation.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.820]   - Right, I see.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:19.700]   - I'd rather see a free educational system
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.180]   where freedom is in education.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.100]   - Okay, so I wanna register a dissent
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.700]   about Lincoln.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.820]   Look, Lincoln is an important figure and a great man,
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.740]   and he was presiding over a country
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.300]   which at that point was pretty Jeffersonian
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.780]   in terms of its self-perception.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.060]   He said what he needed to say.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.500]   I'm not gonna criticize him,
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.540]   but I don't accept the idea
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.900]   that the Declaration of Independence,
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.220]   which starts one revolution,
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:50.580]   is of a piece with the second constitution,
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.620]   the Constitution of 1787,
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.660]   the Nationalist Constitution,
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.820]   which is effectively a counter-revolution.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:00.180]   What happens is there is a revolution.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:01.820]   It's based on certain principles.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.540]   There are a lot, not exactly,
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.420]   but in many ways resemble the later ideas
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.980]   of the French Revolution.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.620]   And what the Federalist Party does,
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.460]   the Nationalist Conservative Party does,
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:16.220]   is a counter-revolution to reinstate
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.020]   the old English Constitution.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.220]   So these documents are,
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.580]   if you're willing to accept the evidence of history,
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.060]   they are in many respects contrary to one another.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.620]   And so if I'm asked what's the most important values
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:34.100]   that are handed down by these documents,
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   I don't have an objection to life, liberty, and property,
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.220]   all of which are really important things.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:46.220]   I do have an objection to the pompous overreach
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:50.340]   of these are self-evident, which is absurd.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.420]   They can't be self-evident.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.420]   If they were self-evident,
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.220]   then somebody would have come up with them
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.220]   like 2,000 years before.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.860]   It's not self-evident.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.700]   And so that's damaging.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:04.580]   I like the conservative preamble of the Constitution,
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.660]   which describes the purposes of the national government
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.100]   that's being established.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.780]   There are seven purposes, a more perfect union,
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.300]   which is the principle of cohesion, justice,
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:24.020]   domestic peace, common defense, the general welfare,
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.740]   which is the welfare of the public
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.020]   as a thing that's not only individuals,
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.500]   but there is such a thing as a general welfare,
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.060]   liberty, which we agree is absolutely crucial,
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:38.540]   and posterity, the idea that the purpose of the government
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:42.740]   is to be able to sustain and grow this independent nation,
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.780]   and not only to guarantee rights no matter what happens.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:46.980]   - But you don't like the,
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.820]   we hold these truths to be self-evident,
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.220]   so you're definitely a Beatles guy.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.660]   You don't want the pompous,
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.340]   you don't need that revolutionary strength.
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:59.460]   - Look, I just, I think that that expression,
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.820]   self-evident truths, it does tremendous damage
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:07.100]   because instead of a moderate skepticism,
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.060]   which says, look, we may not know everything,
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.500]   it says, look, we know everything.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.100]   Here it is, here's what we know, we know.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:14.940]   - We don't know everything,
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.540]   but we think. - No, we, we.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.500]   - So I'll agree with you on, I don't like self-evident.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.660]   I don't like self-evident because he's absolutely right.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.980]   It's not self-evident.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.820]   These are massive achievements.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.620]   These are massive achievements of enlightened thinking,
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.980]   of studying history, of understanding human nature,
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.980]   of deriving a truth from 3,000 years of historical knowledge
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.340]   and a better understanding of human nature and capacity.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.900]   It's using reason in some ways better
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.060]   than any human beings have.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.580]   I mean, the founding fathers, giants historically,
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.900]   in my view, because they came up with these truths.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.060]   I do think they're truths,
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:57.620]   but they're certainly not self-evident.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.820]   I mean, if they were, you're almost right.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.620]   They would have discovered them thousands of years earlier
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.460]   or everybody would accept them, right?
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.820]   I mean, how many people today think that those,
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.780]   what they state in that document is true?
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.660]   Pretty much, you know, five people, I don't know.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.540]   It's very--
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.700]   - That's your criticism of modern society.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.540]   Yes, we'll get there.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.820]   - It's very, very few people recognize it.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.340]   If they were self-evident, bam, everybody would have become,
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.220]   you know, would have accepted the American Revolution
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.260]   as truth and that was it.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.060]   A lot of work has to go into understanding and describing
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.900]   and convincing people about this truth.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:37.180]   But I completely disagree with you all about this idea,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.100]   or I'll voice my dissent, as we said, about--
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.620]   - Register your official dissent.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.180]   - About A, that this being two different revolutions
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.140]   and B, that the American Revolution was at any similarity
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.540]   to the French Revolution.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.780]   - You know that Jefferson and Paine, they were in France.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.700]   - Oh, I know, I know.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.540]   - Running a different revolution.
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.300]   - I know, but they were writing constantly.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.060]   I mean, they were in communication with Madison.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.860]   There was a lot of input going on.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.900]   - I know, and Jefferson's sitting there in Paris
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.540]   pulling his hair out because Madison has come
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.260]   under the influence of these nationalists
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.740]   and he can't believe it.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.420]   - The reality is that the difference
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.100]   between the French Revolution and the American Revolution
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.860]   is vast and it is a deep philosophical difference.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.980]   And it's a difference that expressed, I think,
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.020]   between the differences.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.420]   You know, Yoram, in his writings, lumps Rousseau
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.780]   with Locke and with Voltaire and with others.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.260]   And I think that's wrong.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.300]   I think Rousseau is very different than the others.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.260]   I think, again, Rousseau is an anti-Enlightenment figure.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:42.020]   Rousseau is, in many respects, harkening back to a past,
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:46.420]   an ancient past, and I think a completely distorted view
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.300]   of human nature, of human mind.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.940]   He rejects reason.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.780]   I mean, Rousseau is on the premise
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.180]   that reason is the end of humanity.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.540]   Reason is the destruction of humanity.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540]   Reason is how we get civilization,
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.300]   and civilization is awful because--
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.140]   - I don't disagree.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.580]   We're only talking about different texts.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.900]   When I say, I'm just talking about the social contract.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.140]   - Yeah, but the social contract,
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.940]   there's similarity between others,
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.900]   but he takes it in a completely different direction.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.580]   And we agree, a social contract is a bad idea.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.780]   But you can't have a contract
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.340]   that you don't actually voluntarily accept.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.340]   But Rousseau is the French Revolution.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.300]   Rousseau is about destruction and mayhem
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.620]   and chaos and anarchy.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:29.020]   He is the spirit behind the French Revolution.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.140]   I think the American Revolution
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.020]   is a complete rejection of Rousseau.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.380]   I think Jefferson is a complete rejection of Rousseau.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.220]   I don't think Jefferson is a fan of Rousseau.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.700]   He is a Voltaire, and he certainly is a Montesquieu.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.180]   If you look at the Federalist Papers,
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.580]   the intellectual most cited in the Federalist Papers,
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.180]   I think, in terms of just the number of times it's cited,
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.900]   is Montesquieu.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.460]   So I think that the American Revolution
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.740]   is an individualistic revolution.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.340]   It is a revolution about the rights of the individual.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.220]   The French Revolution is a negation
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.220]   of the rights of the individual.
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.060]   It's a collectivistic revolution.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.780]   It's not quite the Marxist revolution of the proletarian,
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.740]   but it's defining people in classes,
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.380]   and it's a rebellion against a certain class,
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.980]   and yeah, kill 'em all, right?
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.420]   Off with their heads.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.220]   And it is a negation.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.780]   It's about egalitarianism in the sense of equality
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.700]   of outcome, not in a sense of equality before the law
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.620]   or equality of rights, which is the Jeffersonian sense.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.860]   So I think it's wrong to lump Jefferson
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:30.500]   into the fraternity, you know,
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.220]   egalitarian notion of the French,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.500]   which is far more similar to what ultimately
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.180]   became socialism and Marxism,
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.060]   and kind of that tradition.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.780]   It's anti-individualistic, the French Revolution is,
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.260]   whereas the American Revolution, the first one,
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.660]   is individualistic.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.220]   It's all about individual rights.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.300]   And while there's certain phrases
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.500]   in the Declaration of Independence
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.860]   that I don't agree with, you know,
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.340]   it's beautifully written, and it's a magnificent document,
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.740]   so it's hard for me to say I don't agree, who am I, right?
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.740]   These were giants.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.220]   Self-evident is one of them.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:09.500]   You know, I'm not particularly crazy about
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.620]   Endowed by the Creator, but I like the fact
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.740]   that it's creator and not God, or not a specific creator,
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.940]   but just kind of a more general thing.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.140]   But putting those two ashes aside,
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.740]   it's the greatest political document
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.860]   in all of human history, in my view, by far.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.980]   Nothing comes close.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:30.020]   It is a document that identifies the core principles
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.940]   of political truism, of truth.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.940]   That is, the role of government is to preserve
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.980]   and to protect these rights, these inalienable rights.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:42.140]   And that is so crucial, that these rights are inalienable.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.500]   That is, a majority can't vote them out,
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.420]   Revelation can't vote them out.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.020]   This is what is required for human liberty
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:51.980]   and human freedom.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.980]   The right, that is, the sanction, the freedom
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.940]   to act on your own behalf, to act based on your own judgment.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.340]   And as long as you're not interfering
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:04.140]   with other people's rights, you are free to do so.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.500]   That is such a profound truth.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.940]   And that, to me, is the essence of political philosophy.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940]   That's the beginning.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:15.660]   And it's based on, just not to fall into,
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.900]   you know, I'm just gonna say it's irrational.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.260]   It's based on a whole history of what happens
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.180]   when we negate that.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.060]   It's based on looking at England and seeing to the extent
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.100]   that they practiced a respect for individual liberty,
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.780]   a property of freedom.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.380]   Good things happened.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.260]   So let's take that all the way.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:35.940]   Let's not compromise on that.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:40.300]   Let's be consistent with the good and reject the bad.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.140]   And when England goes away, distance itself
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.820]   from the rights of man, from the idea of a right
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.220]   to property and so on, bad things happen.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.460]   And when they go to, let's go all in.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:54.180]   And I'm all in on the right to life, liberty, property,
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.500]   and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.940]   And I think the idea of pursuit of happiness is profound
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.780]   because it's a moral statement.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.540]   It's a statement that says that sanctions
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.580]   and says that ultimately people should be allowed
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.620]   to make their own judgments and live their lives
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.380]   as they see fit based on how they view happiness.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.540]   They might be right, they might be wrong,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:18.180]   but we're not gonna dictate what happiness entails
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.660]   and dictate to people how they should live their lives.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.660]   We're gonna let them figure that out.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:28.020]   So it has this self-interested moral code
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.380]   kind of embedded in it.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.140]   So I think it's a beautiful statement.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.540]   So I think the declaration is key.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:35.140]   And I think there was an experiment,
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.580]   and the experiment was post in that period
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.020]   of before the constitution, where the experiment was,
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.260]   let's let the states,
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.420]   let's have a kind of a loose confederation.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.340]   Let's let the states experiment
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.580]   with setting up their own constitutions
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:51.580]   and role of government,
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.940]   and we won't have any kind of unity.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.820]   And I think what they realized,
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.460]   and I think even Jefferson realized,
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.740]   is that that was not workable
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.820]   because many of the states were starting
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.080]   to significantly violate rights.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.980]   There was nothing to unify.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.860]   There was nothing to really protect
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.460]   the vision of the declaration.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.740]   You needed to establish a nation,
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.380]   which is what the constitution does.
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.100]   It establishes a nation.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:21.340]   But the purpose of that was to put everybody
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:25.260]   under one set of laws that protected rights.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.860]   The focus was still on the protection of rights.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:31.180]   And I agree with six of the seven of the principles.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.300]   - Which did disagree with?
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.420]   - The common welfare, which the general welfare,
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.620]   which I worry about.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.460]   I think in the way the founders understood it,
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.040]   I think I probably agreed with it.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.580]   But it's such an ambiguous--
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.420]   - I'm sure you don't agree.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.260]   - Maybe I don't.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.080]   Maybe I don't.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.380]   - Can you state the general welfare principle?
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.180]   - Well, the idea that part of the role of government
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.380]   is to secure the general welfare is something--
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.460]   - Look, this is something,
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.900]   we didn't get to it in the debate.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.940]   We really should have.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:00.660]   Is the question of whether there is such a thing
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.600]   as a common good or a public interest
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.340]   or a national interest or a general welfare.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.900]   Do these words, do these terms mean anything
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.460]   other than the good of all of the individuals
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.300]   in the country?
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.620]   - That's an important, sorry, let me interrupt you.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.100]   - Yeah, so that's right.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.820]   So that's why, so I object to it
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.660]   because I think it's too easy to interpret it as.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:24.580]   So I interpret it as, well, what's good for a general,
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.980]   a group, a common, a people,
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.180]   or just a collection of individuals.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.100]   So what's good for the individual
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.540]   is good for the common welfare.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.540]   But I understand that that is a,
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.180]   that's something that is hard for people to grasp
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.160]   and not the common understanding.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.140]   So I would have skipped the general welfare
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.980]   in order to avoid the fact that now
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:45.100]   the general welfare includes the government telling you
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.380]   what gender you should be assigned.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.980]   So I would have wanted to have skipped that completely.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:53.460]   So I think the Constitution is completely consistent
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   with the Declaration with a few exceptions,
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.220]   the general welfare, but perfection
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.620]   is a difficult thing to find,
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.820]   particularly for me, right, politically.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.500]   But it's a magnificent document, the Constitution.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.180]   It doesn't quite rise to the level, I think,
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.700]   of the Declaration, but it's a magnificent document.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.660]   Because, you know, and this is the difference, I think,
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.860]   between the English Constitution.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.660]   Here's what I see as the difference.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:19.500]   The difference is that the Constitution
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.740]   is written in the context of,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.440]   why do we have a separation of powers, for example?
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.020]   We have a separation of powers in order to make sure
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:27.860]   that the government only does
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.940]   what the government is supposed to do.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.300]   And what is the government supposed to do?
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.040]   Well, fundamentally, it's supposed to protect rights.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.820]   I mean, all of those seven, or at least six of the seven,
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   are about protecting rights.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.660]   They're about protecting us from foreign invaders.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:41.300]   They're about protecting, you know,
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.900]   peace within the country.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.380]   They're about preserving this protection of rights.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.580]   And why do we have this separation?
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.540]   So that we make sure that no one of those entities,
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.580]   the executive, or the legislature, judicial,
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.420]   can violate rights, 'cause there's always somebody
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.580]   looking over their shoulder.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.980]   There's always somebody who can veto their power.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.300]   But there's a purpose to it,
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.140]   and that purpose is clearly signified and characterized.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.860]   And that's why I think the Bill of Rights was written,
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.580]   in order to add to the clarification
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.620]   of what exactly we mean, what is the purpose?
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.740]   The purpose is to preserve rights.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.100]   And that's why we need to elaborate with those rights.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.620]   And Madison's objection to the Bill of Rights
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.620]   was to say, not that he objected
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.140]   to having protection of rights,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.160]   but to listing them, because he was worried
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.060]   that other rights that were not listed would not be.
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.980]   And his worry was completely justified,
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.340]   'cause it's exactly what's happened.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.380]   It's like, the only reason we have free speech
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.940]   in America is 'cause we've got it in writing
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.180]   as a First Amendment.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.180]   If we didn't have it in writing,
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.740]   it would have been gone a long time ago.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.500]   And the reason we don't have, for example,
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.680]   the freedom to negotiate a contract,
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.060]   independent government regulation,
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.340]   is that was not listed as a right in the bill,
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.220]   even though I think it's clearly covered
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.580]   under the Constitution, and certainly under the Declaration.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.980]   So there was a massive mistake done in the Bill of Rights.
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.780]   They tried to cover it with the Ninth Amendment,
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.220]   but it never really stuck, this idea that,
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.820]   non-enumerated rights that are still in place.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.620]   So I don't see it as a second revolution.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.420]   I think it's a fix to a flaw that happened.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.540]   It's a fix that allowed the expansion
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:21.340]   of the protection of rights to all states
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.140]   by creating a national entity to protect those rights.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.980]   And that's what ultimately led to slavery going away.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.860]   Under the initial agreement,
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.920]   slavery would have been there in perpetuity
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.540]   because states were sovereign in a way
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.720]   that under the new Constitution, they were not.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.340]   And in a sense, the Constitution sets in motion,
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.180]   the Declaration and then the Constitution set in motion,
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.340]   the Civil War.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.500]   The Civil War has to happen because at the end of the day,
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.540]   you cannot have some states
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.100]   with a massive violation of rights,
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.500]   what's more of a violation of rights than slavery,
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.100]   and some states that recognize it's not,
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.060]   it inevitably leads to the Civil War.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.700]   - Jaron was just saying that,
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.500]   other than the general welfare,
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.500]   these principles are about individual liberties.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.460]   I just don't think you can read it that way.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:13.140]   The first stated purpose of the Constitution of 1787
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.860]   is in order to form a more perfect union.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.140]   A more perfect union,
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:21.140]   it's describing a characteristic of the whole.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:24.380]   It is not a characteristic of any individual.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:25.980]   If you look at how the individuals are doing,
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.100]   you don't know whether their union is more or less perfect.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.500]   So what they're doing is they're looking at the condition
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.100]   in which in order to be able to fight
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:37.380]   the Battle of Yorktown,
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.940]   they have to, somebody has to write a personal check
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:41.580]   in order to be able to move armies.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.660]   A more perfect union is a more cohesive union.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:48.100]   It's the ability to get all of these different individuals
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.560]   to do one focused thing when it's necessary to do it.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.060]   - Well, it's more than that, right?
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.620]   So I agree with that.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.700]   But for what purpose?
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.420]   That is, and this is why,
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.620]   this is why it's so hard with these historical documents
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.060]   'cause there's a context and there's a thinking
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.060]   that they can't write everything down, right?
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.140]   Which is sad because I wish they had.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.300]   What's the purpose of a more perfect union?
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.540]   The purpose of the more perfect union
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.640]   is to preserve the liberty of the individuals
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.480]   within that union.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.140]   - But how do you know?
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.920]   - Because if you look, what's the rest?
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.220]   So what is the common defense?
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.500]   The common defense is to protect us from foreign invaders
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.480]   who would now disrupt what the rest of the constitution
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.320]   is all about.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.340]   All of the constitution is written in a way
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.760]   as to preserve, find ways to limit the ability of government
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.660]   to violate the rights of individuals.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.500]   That the beauty of this constitution,
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.960]   and again, it's connection to the declaration
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.740]   and tradition, right?
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.780]   What came before it?
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.800]   What came before it was a document which they all respected,
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.700]   which was the declaration, which set the context for this.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.380]   And now the union is there in order to provide
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.020]   for the common defense, great, because we know
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.000]   that foreign invaders can violate our rights.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.540]   That's what war is about.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.580]   To protect us from peace, to establish peace and justice
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.060]   within the country, that's based on law, the rule of law,
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:09.380]   and again, individual liberty.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.100]   So to me, when you read the founders,
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.280]   when you read the federalist papers,
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.580]   when you read what they wrote, what they're trying to do
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.500]   is figure out the right kind of political system,
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.060]   the right kind of structure to be able
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.740]   to preserve these liberties.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.340]   And not all of them had, from my perspective,
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.540]   a perfect understanding what those liberties entailed,
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.760]   but they were all, even the conservatives
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.240]   that you call conservatives, were all in generally
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.340]   in agreement about the importance of individual liberty
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.180]   and the importance of individual rights.
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:42.300]   - Of course, because almost all of these rights
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.920]   are traditional English rights.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.700]   They exist in the English Bill of Rights
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.500]   and the English Petition of Rights.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.620]   They exist in-- - Of course, of course.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.540]   - All of these are traditional--
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.780]   - And what they're trying to do is perfect that.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.900]   They're trying to take the British system and perfect it.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:58.740]   - But you keep leaving out that they wanna be like England
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.100]   in that they wanna have an independent nation.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.660]   An independent nation is not a collection
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.660]   of individual liberties.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.940]   An independent nation, the first sentence
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.740]   of the Declaration of Independence is the declaration
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.140]   that there is a collective right,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.220]   that we as a people are breaking the bonds
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.900]   within other people, and we're gonna take our place,
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.980]   our equal station among the nations of the earth.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.220]   - For what purpose?
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.140]   The purpose is to protect individual rights,
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.180]   and there's no collective rights.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.740]   - No, your argument is completely circular.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:30.380]   You're not allowing the possibility that there could be
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:34.180]   great and decent men that you and I both admire
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.300]   who wanted the independence of their nation,
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.860]   not because that would give individuals liberty,
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.220]   but because the independence of their nation
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.140]   was itself a great good.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.780]   So we clearly disagree on this,
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.980]   because I don't think the independence of the nation
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.060]   is a good in and of itself, because it's--
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.740]   - But did they think it was?
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.340]   - I don't think they did, and this is why they tried
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.380]   so hard not to break from England,
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:02.380]   and why many of them struggled, really, really struggled
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.260]   with having a revolution, because England was pretty good.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.980]   England was the best, and this is where we should get
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.400]   to the universality of these things,
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.540]   because I do think England was the best,
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:17.980]   and universally and absolutely was the best system out there
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.660]   and what they were, they struggled to break from England
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.860]   because they didn't view the value of having a nation
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.660]   as the priming, but what they identified in England
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.380]   is certain flaws in the system that created situations
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.400]   in which their rights were being violated.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.820]   So they figured the only option in order to secure
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.500]   these rights is to break away from England
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.340]   and secure a nation.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.860]   Now, I am not an anarchist as--
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.100]   - Michael Malik is.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.420]   - Because we've discussed it.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.260]   I believe you need nations.
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:48.860]   You need nations to secure those rights.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.620]   That is, the rights are not, you can't secure those rights
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.580]   without having a nation, but the nation is just a means
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.380]   to an end, the end is the rights, and I think that's how
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.020]   the founders understood it, and that's why they created
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.580]   this kind of country.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.740]   - I think this is a good place to ask about
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.700]   common welfare and cohesion.
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:11.460]   Let me say what John Donne wrote, that, quote,
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.260]   "No man is an island entire of itself.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:18.340]   "Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.740]   He went on, "Any man's death diminishes me
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.660]   "because I am involved in mankind, and therefore,
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.860]   "never send to know for whom the bell tolls.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.560]   "It tolls for thee."
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:36.940]   So, let's talk about individualism and cohesion,
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.860]   not just at the political level, but at a philosophical
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.380]   level for the human condition.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.980]   What is central?
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.620]   What is the role of other humans in our lives?
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.100]   What's the importance of cohesion?
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.900]   This is something you've talked about.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:57.520]   So, Eron said that the beauty of the founding documents
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.660]   is that they create a cohesive union that protects
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:05.480]   the individual freedoms, but you have spoken about
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.220]   the value of the union, the common welfare,
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.140]   the cohesion in itself.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:18.140]   So, can you maybe elaborate on what is the role of cohesion
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.620]   and the collective, not to use that term,
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:23.820]   but multiple humans together connected
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.300]   in the human condition?
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.900]   - Sure, I keep getting the feeling that Eron and I
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.140]   are actually having a disagreement about empirical reality
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.100]   because I think that Enlightenment rationalist
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.000]   political thought features the individual,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.800]   it features the state.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.220]   There isn't really a nation other than the nation,
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:48.340]   the people as a collective is created by the state,
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.780]   and when the state disappears,
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:51.660]   then the collective disappears.
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:56.220]   Now, I think that when conservatives of all stripes
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.580]   look at this kind of thinking,
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.580]   that there's the individuals and then there's the state,
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.820]   and there really isn't anything else.
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.500]   When they look at that, they say,
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.960]   even before you get to consequences,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.660]   it's a terrible theory because when we try to understand
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:16.020]   any field of inquiry, any domain, any subject area,
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.220]   when you try to understand it,
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:22.820]   we try to come up with a small number of concepts
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:27.300]   and of relations among the concepts,
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.580]   which is supposed to be able to explain,
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:34.260]   to illuminate as much as possible
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.260]   the important things that are taking place in the domain.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.780]   And conservatives look at this individuals and the state,
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.340]   and they say, you're missing most of what's going on
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:49.340]   in politics, also in personal human relations as well,
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.740]   but it just doesn't look like a description
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.580]   of human beings.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.460]   It looks like a completely artificial thing,
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.100]   and then conservatives say, well, look,
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.980]   once you adopt this artificial thing,
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.500]   then the consequences are horrific
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.640]   because you're not describing reality.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:07.640]   So a conservative reality begins with an empirical view
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.260]   of what are human beings like,
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.120]   and the first thing you notice about human beings,
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.140]   or at least the first thing I think conservatives notice,
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.580]   is that they're sticky, is that they clump,
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.620]   they turn into groups.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:25.120]   And you take any arbitrary collection of human beings
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.800]   and set them to a task, or even just leave them alone,
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.140]   and they quickly form into groups,
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.780]   and those groups are always structured as hierarchies.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.620]   It's this competition within the hierarchy,
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:39.100]   who's gonna be the leader, who's gonna be number two,
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.440]   but everywhere you look in human societies,
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.880]   universally, there are groups, the groups compete,
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.460]   and they're structured internally as hierarchies,
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.440]   and then there are internal competitions
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.860]   for who leads the different groups.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.640]   And when we think about scientific explanation,
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.600]   we allow that there are different levels of explanation,
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.620]   that a macroscopic object like a table,
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.720]   it doesn't have properties that can be directly derived
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.300]   from the properties of the atoms, or the molecules,
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.660]   or the microfibers that make up the table.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.280]   And that's understood, that there's what
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.960]   academic philosophers call emergent properties,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.200]   that when you get up to the level of the table,
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.820]   it has properties like that you can't put your fist
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.280]   through it, which you can't necessarily know
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.880]   just by looking at the atoms alone.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.340]   And I think conservatives say the same thing is true
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.980]   for political theory, for social theory,
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.380]   that looking at an individual human being
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.220]   and thinking about what does that individual human being
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:46.180]   need, which Jeroen does very eloquently in his writings,
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:49.700]   but that doesn't tell you what the characteristics are
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:53.300]   of this hierarchically structured group.
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.540]   As soon as you have that, it has its own qualities.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.280]   So an example, the question of what holds
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.500]   these groups together, and we need to answer that question.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.100]   I try to answer it by saying there's such a thing
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.060]   as mutual loyalty.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.060]   Mutual loyalty is shorthand for human beings.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:15.340]   Individuals have the capacity to include another individual
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:19.120]   within their self, within their conception of their self.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.460]   When two people do it, it creates a bond,
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:27.560]   like a bond between two atoms creates a molecule.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.100]   That doesn't mean that they lose their individuality.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.940]   Within the group, they may still continue competing
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.720]   with one another, but that doesn't mean
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.500]   that there isn't in reality a bond,
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:42.500]   and that real bond is the stuff of which political events
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.400]   and political history are made, is the coming together,
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.820]   the cohesion, and the dissolution
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.100]   of these bonded loyalty groups.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.420]   That's the reality of politics.
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:57.620]   So when I hear these discussions
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.720]   about individuals in the state,
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.700]   I feel like we're missing most of the reality.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.620]   And in order to understand the political reality,
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.840]   we need to understand what makes human beings
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.860]   coherent to groups, what makes them dissolve,
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.680]   what makes the groups come apart
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.520]   and end up creating civil wars and that kind of thing.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.060]   I think we also need to know,
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.680]   in practice, rival groups do come together and bond.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.320]   I mean, basically, when we think about democratic society,
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.520]   we're talking about different groups.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.840]   We can call them tribes,
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.120]   or you can come up with a different name,
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.680]   but different tribal groupings with different views,
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.360]   they come together to form a nation,
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.200]   and they're able to do that,
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.640]   even though often they hate each other,
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.400]   like we were talking about the American Revolution,
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.160]   often they hate each other.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.140]   And nevertheless, they're able to come together.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:54.720]   Why? How?
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.320]   And that leads us into questions like,
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.080]   how does honor, the giving of honor by one group to another,
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.560]   how does that increase the mutual loyalty
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.160]   between groups that are still competing with one another?
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.600]   All of these questions, I think we have to answer them
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.260]   in order to be able to talk about politics.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:20.580]   And I think the reason, the first reason
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.820]   why one should approach politics as a conservative
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.580]   rather than as an individualist
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:28.900]   is because it gives us these theoretical tools
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.560]   to be able to talk about reality,
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.540]   which we don't have as long as we keep
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.340]   within the individualist framework.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.540]   - As you're talking,
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.220]   the metaphor that's popping up into my mind,
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.420]   and this is also something that bothers me
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.180]   with theoretical physics,
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.740]   the metaphor is there's some sense
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.900]   in which there's things called theories of everything,
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:52.100]   where you try to describe the basic laws of physics,
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.540]   how they interact together,
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.140]   and once you do, you have a sense
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.380]   that you understand all of reality.
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.100]   In a sense, you do.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:03.220]   And that to me is understanding the individual,
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:06.180]   like how the individual behaves in this world.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.980]   But then you're saying that, hey, hey,
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.260]   you're also forgetting chemistry, biology,
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.300]   how all of that actually comes together,
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.820]   the stickiness, the stickiness of molecules,
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.460]   and how they build different systems,
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.500]   and some systems can kill each other,
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.580]   some systems can flourish,
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:26.260]   some can make pancakes and bananas,
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.020]   and some can make poison, and all those kinds of things,
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.380]   and we need to be able to,
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.500]   we need to consider the full stack
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:39.180]   of things that are constructed from the fundamental basics.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.340]   And I guess, Yaron, you're saying that, no,
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.380]   (laughs)
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.300]   you're just like the theoretical physicist.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.980]   It all starts at the bottom.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:53.580]   Like if you need to preserve the fundamentals of reality,
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.260]   which is the individual,
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:59.540]   like the basic atom of human society
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.100]   is the individual to you.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:04.620]   - So yes, so the basic unit, the basic model unit,
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:07.940]   the basic ethical unit in society is the individual.
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:10.180]   And yeah, of course we form groups.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.060]   And you can't understand history
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.220]   unless you understand group formation and group motivation.
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:18.260]   And I have a view about what kind of groups
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:19.140]   should be formed,
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:22.620]   and politically, from a political perspective,
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:27.020]   voluntary ones, ones in which we join when we want to join,
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.620]   and we can leave when we want to leave,
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:33.620]   and ones that help us, and clearly groups help us,
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:38.700]   pursue whatever it is our goal is ultimately.
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.500]   So in the pursuit of happiness,
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.340]   there are lots of groups that one wants to form,
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:46.100]   whether it's marriage, whether it's businesses,
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.820]   whether it's sports teams, whether it's lots of,
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.940]   there are lots of different groups one wants to form.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:54.100]   But the question is, what is the standard of well-being?
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:58.740]   Is it the standard well-being some algorithm
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.980]   that maximizes the well-being of a group,
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.540]   some utilitarian function?
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:08.420]   Is it something that's inherent in the group
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.020]   that we can measure as goodness,
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:12.580]   and to help with individuals within,
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.860]   as long as we can get the group to function well?
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   We don't really care about where the individuals are.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:22.060]   So to me, the goal of creating groups
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.340]   is the well-being of the individual,
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.780]   and that's why it needs to be voluntary,
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.380]   and that's why there has to be a way out of those.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.780]   Sometimes it's costly.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.980]   It's not a cheap out.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:32.500]   That's why you should really think about what groups you,
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.740]   and this, on an issue that's very controversial,
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.980]   maybe we can discuss, maybe not.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.660]   This is why, to me, immigration is so important, right?
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.980]   Open immigration or free immigration
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.340]   is because that's another group
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.900]   that I would like people to be able to voluntarily choose,
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.580]   both in and out.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.820]   And I'd like to see people be able to go and join
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.180]   that group that they believe
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.260]   will allow for the pursuit of happiness.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:59.020]   But let me say that that's a description of an ideal,
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.260]   what I'm just saying, right?
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:03.460]   I recognize that that's not the reality in which we live.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.500]   I recognize that that's not the reality in which history,
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.740]   you know, recognizing that such a,
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.580]   that the individual exists in a sense, philosophically,
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.580]   is a massive achievement, right?
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.620]   You know, human beings, however they evolved,
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:20.300]   clearly we started out in a tribal context
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.980]   in which individual didn't matter.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.420]   We followed the leader.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.460]   The competition was for power, power over the group,
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.020]   and dictates how the group should work.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:32.500]   You know, the history of human beings
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.380]   is a history of gaining knowledge,
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:38.380]   and part of the knowledge is the value of an individual.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.420]   And you can see that in religion.
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:41.980]   You can see that in philosophy.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.180]   You can see that through the evolution.
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:48.540]   And then, you know, we evolved from tribes into nations,
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:51.420]   and then empires and conflicts between nations
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.740]   and conflict within empires.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.220]   And we tried a lot of different things, if you will.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.740]   I don't think we always did it on purpose,
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:59.620]   but we kind of did different philosophies,
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.380]   different sets of ideas drove us
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:05.140]   towards different collectives, different groupings,
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.940]   and different ways in which to structure.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:12.340]   And after, I don't know, 3,000 years of kind of known history,
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.300]   it's history before that,
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:14.420]   but we don't know much about it,
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.100]   3,000 years of known history,
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.300]   you can sit back and evaluate.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:21.260]   And I think that's what is done in the Enlightenment.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:24.180]   And you sit back, and certainly we can do it today.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.900]   We can sit back and evaluate.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:28.340]   What promotes human flourishing and what doesn't?
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.100]   And what do we mean by human flourishing?
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.900]   Who's flourishing?
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.340]   Well, individual human beings.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.020]   Now, since I don't believe in a zero-sum world,
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.420]   and the world is not zero-sum, we can see that.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:40.540]   It's empirically possible to show
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.940]   that the world is not a zero-sum game.
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.580]   My flourishing doesn't come at your expense.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:47.140]   So, you know, I can show that a system
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.140]   that promotes my flourishing
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.620]   probably promotes your flourishing as well
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.020]   and promotes the general welfare in that sense,
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:55.900]   because it promotes individuals flourishing.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:00.900]   And we can look at all these examples of how we evolved
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:02.980]   and what leads to bloodshed and what doesn't
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:06.580]   and what promotes this ability to flourish as an individual.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:09.780]   Again, an achievement, the idea of individual flourishing.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.260]   And then we can think about
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.100]   how to create a political system around that,
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:17.180]   a political system that recognizes
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.900]   and allows for the formation of groups,
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.580]   but just under the principle of voluntary.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:24.220]   So you can't be forced to join a group.
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:26.900]   You can't be cursed into forming a group
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:30.300]   other than the fact that you're born in a particular place
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:32.380]   and a particular, you know, that in a sense,
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.060]   but that's not forced.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.780]   There's a difference between metaphysics
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:36.620]   and between choices.
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.460]   - So this is something that came up in the debate
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:42.100]   that Yoram said that not all human relations are voluntary,
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:45.780]   and you kind of emphasized that a lot of where we are
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.020]   is not voluntary.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:50.500]   We're grounded, we're connected in so much.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.220]   So how can a human be free
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:55.180]   in the way you're describing,
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:00.180]   individual be free if some part of who we are
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:03.300]   is not voluntary, some part of who we are is other people?
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:05.540]   - Well, because what do we mean by freedom?
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:09.700]   Freedom doesn't mean the negation of the laws of physics.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.420]   Freedom doesn't mean ignoring.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:16.860]   Freedom means the ability within the scope
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:18.540]   of what's available for you to choose,
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.260]   being able to choose those things.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.060]   So in a political context, freedom means,
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:30.700]   you know, the absence of coercion.
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.620]   So once you're an adult, you know, Yoram says,
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.380]   you're born into a particular religious context.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:37.780]   Absolutely, but once you're an adult,
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:38.860]   I think it's incumbent on you
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:40.940]   to evaluate that religious context
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:44.860]   and look at different religions or non-religion or whatever
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:48.380]   and choose your philosophy of life, choose your values,
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:50.180]   choose how you wanna live your life.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.100]   That's the freedom.
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.940]   The freedom is, one system says,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.500]   you're either coerced by the state
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.500]   or coerced by the group or coerced by society around you
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.380]   to follow a particular path,
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:07.100]   or the expectation is, the demand is,
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.860]   the pressure is to conform to a particular path.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.540]   And my view is, no, you should be in a position
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.060]   to be able to choose your path.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.300]   And that choice means you look around,
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.500]   you evaluate, you evaluate the history based on knowledge,
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.180]   based on all of these things,
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:25.740]   and you choose what that path would be.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.620]   That's fundamentally what freedom means.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:31.740]   Yes, you cannot choose your parents, but of course not.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.100]   Nobody would claim that that's within the scope
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:34.940]   of what is possible.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:39.940]   - I think the coercion-freedom dichotomy,
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:43.420]   these are too few concepts, coercion and freedom.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:45.860]   It's too simplistic to be able to describe
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.540]   what we're actually dealing with.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.300]   The traditional Anglo-conservative view
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:56.300]   is that society has to be, it has to be ordered,
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.580]   it has to be disciplined.
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:03.220]   And there are two choices for how it can be ordered.
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:08.220]   One is that a people is, by its own traditions,
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.140]   you would say voluntarily,
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:12.300]   but these are mostly inherited traditions,
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:16.580]   by its own traditions, it is ordered.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.620]   For example, people just in general
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.340]   will not go into somebody else's yard
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:24.180]   because that's the custom here,
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:25.980]   is we don't go into somebody else's yard
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:27.300]   without their permission.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:31.220]   And so Fortescue, we're talking about 500 years ago already,
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:35.600]   so Fortescue says that the genius of the English people
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.700]   is that our government can be mild
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:40.340]   and apply very little coercion
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:42.820]   because the people are so disciplined.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:44.620]   Now when he says the people are so disciplined,
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.620]   what he's saying is that our nation, our tribes,
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:54.620]   we have strong traditions which channel people
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:59.020]   through tools of being honored and dishonored.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.900]   Now that's a reality that exists in every society,
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:05.300]   and it's not captured by your distinction
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.220]   between coercion and lack of coercion.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:12.220]   When I'm gonna be dishonored if I don't care
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:16.580]   for my aging mother, I'm not being coerced
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.020]   like the state comes and puts a gun to my head,
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:22.900]   but I am being pressured, I'm being given guidelines.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.100]   - But I'm saying that's wrong,
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.700]   and I'm saying that's dangerous
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:30.700]   because that could easily be used for bad traditions.
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:33.060]   - No, of course it is.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:35.820]   - But what's the standard by which we evaluate
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:37.500]   what a good tradition is a bad tradition?
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.380]   So the English--
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:39.900]   - You're getting to the standard too,
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.180]   wait, wait, you're getting to the standard too fast.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.340]   First I wanna know factually is it true
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.900]   that all societies work like this?
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.780]   Because if it's true that all societies work like this,
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.980]   then saying we should be free from it is just a fantasy.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:54.420]   - No, so A, I don't think all societies work like this.
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:57.700]   I think much of what happened in America post-founding
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.340]   in the 19th century didn't work like that.
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:01.180]   I think that's the genius of America.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:03.300]   And I think what happened during the 19th century
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.620]   in the Industrial Revolution,
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:07.340]   what happened in the 19th century,
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.620]   to some extent globally, but certainly in the United States,
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.860]   didn't work that way.
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.380]   It broke tradition.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.300]   I think all innovation breaks tradition.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.180]   And I think that's what the genius of this country is
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:21.380]   and the post-Enlightenment world is.
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:24.420]   I think pre that tradition, they worked that way.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:25.740]   And then the question is,
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:28.100]   did people understand why they do what they do?
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:33.100]   That is, I don't want people doing what I think is right,
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.060]   just because I think it's right
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.460]   and I've created a society in which,
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:42.180]   yeah, okay, somebody founded this country
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:43.660]   in a particular way, so we're just gonna follow.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.340]   I want people to understand what they're doing.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.060]   So I want people to have a respect for property,
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:48.540]   not because it's a tradition,
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.900]   but because they understand the value
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:53.020]   of a respect for property.
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:54.900]   I want people not to murder one another,
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.700]   not because there's a commandment, thou shall not murder,
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.620]   but because they have an understanding
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:03.740]   of why murdering is bad and wrong and bad for them
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.740]   and bad for the kind of world that they want to live in.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:09.740]   And I think that's what we achieve through enlightenment,
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.300]   through education,
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:16.300]   through where we don't treat people just as a blob,
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.860]   tribe that just follows orders,
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.220]   but we now treat individuals
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.940]   as capable of thinking for themselves,
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:24.180]   capable for discovering truth,
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:27.540]   capable of figuring out their own values.
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:30.740]   And that's the big break between,
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.100]   and this is why, this is the break, I think,
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:34.860]   that the Declaration represents,
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:37.860]   the break between society that is based on tradition,
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:40.220]   following commandments, following rules,
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:41.380]   because they are the rules,
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.420]   because they are the commandments,
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:46.140]   and a society where individuals understand those rules,
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:49.500]   understand, yes, it's now become a tradition, let's say,
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:52.300]   to respect individual rights, to respect property rights.
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.700]   But they're not following it because it's a tradition.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.700]   They're following it because they understand
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.940]   what it is about it that makes it good.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:03.780]   So that's the world I think that we were on the process
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.620]   of evolving towards,
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.260]   and that is what got destroyed in the 20th century
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.860]   and has certainly disappeared today.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.300]   And I think that's the great tragedy,
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.900]   is that we're evolving to a place
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:18.300]   where people understood the values that represent.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.260]   Of course, the danger with tradition is,
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:23.740]   I mean, we'll agree, right?
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.620]   Yeah, it's okay to kill the Jew, right?
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.780]   Or it's okay to steal people's property
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.300]   if they're of a certain color,
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.420]   or it's okay to enslave.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.940]   Those are all traditions.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:34.260]   And yet, once you stop and say,
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.100]   "But what are they based on?
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.040]   "Is this right?
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.340]   "Is this just, based on some moral law?"
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.340]   No, it's not.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:43.340]   There's something wrong here.
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:46.020]   We can't achieve happiness and success if we follow these.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.340]   - You're talking about reason and tradition,
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.300]   but I think I would love to sort of linger
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:53.580]   on the stickiness of humans that you described.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:56.380]   So you kind of said that it's primary,
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:59.860]   the individuals, it's primary, no, it's a great invention.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:04.180]   But to me, it's not at all obvious that somehow,
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:09.180]   that the invention that humans have been practicing
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.220]   for a very long time of the stickiness,
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:18.220]   of community, of family, of love,
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.980]   that's not obvious to me.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:25.940]   That's not also fundamental to human flourishing,
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:29.780]   and should be celebrated and protected.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:30.620]   - Of course it is.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:33.740]   - Now, I suppose the argument you're making
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:38.620]   is when you start to let the state define
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.780]   what the stickiness, how the stickiness looks
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.500]   between humans, so you're really like the voluntary aspect.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:48.540]   But I just want to sort of, the observation is,
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:53.540]   humans seem to be pretty happy when they form communities,
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.500]   however you define that.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.500]   So romantic partnership, family--
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.620]   - Some communities.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:02.780]   - Some communities, people are miserable in other communities
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:04.820]   so the nature of the community matters, right?
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.660]   We know this, we know that some bondings are not healthy
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:10.540]   and not good for the individuals involved
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:11.960]   and they don't thrive.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.700]   So I absolutely, I mean, I'm a lover, not a fighter, right?
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.780]   So I'm a huge believer in love,
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.060]   the whole philosophy, I think, is a love-based philosophy.
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.780]   I fight in order to love, right?
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:27.140]   So it's, love is at the core of all of this,
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:32.140]   and it's a love of life, it's a love of the world out there,
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.900]   and it's a love of other people
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.960]   because they represent a value to you.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.900]   So the stickiness is there, it's, you know,
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.240]   my point is, A, it should be chosen,
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.660]   it should be consciously chosen.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.460]   And this is, put aside the state,
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:49.140]   forget the state for a minute, forget coercion,
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:49.980]   forget all that.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.420]   What I would encourage individuals to do,
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:54.980]   and this is where, you know,
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.620]   I'm not primarily a political, you know,
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.780]   interested in politics,
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.500]   although I tend to talk most about that.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.180]   I'm primarily interested in human beings
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:05.660]   and how they live, in a sense, in morality.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:08.520]   And what I would urge individuals to do
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.720]   is to think about their relationships,
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.540]   to choose the best relationships possible,
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.060]   but to seek out great relationships
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:19.580]   because other human beings are an immense value to us.
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:23.480]   And, you know, when I write, you know,
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.820]   maybe you uncoded this or not,
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.380]   but when I write that, you know,
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.340]   about the trader principle and trading,
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:32.420]   you know, it's easy and obvious to think of it
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:34.020]   as a materialistic kind of thing.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:37.220]   You know, I get, you know, I do the chores this day
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:39.420]   and my wife does the chores the other day and we're trading.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.380]   But trading is much more subtle than that
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.580]   and much more, can be much more spiritual than that.
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:48.140]   It's about the trading in emotions,
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.220]   it's about the way one sees each other,
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:53.780]   it's what one gets from one another.
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:55.700]   I think friendship is a form of trade.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:58.500]   Now, I know that that seems to make it material,
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.620]   but I don't think of trade as a material thing.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.180]   But friendship is incredibly important in life.
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:06.060]   Love is incredibly important in life.
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.900]   You know, having a group of friends
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.180]   is incredibly important in life.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:11.620]   All of these are sticky and important.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.620]   - Okay, how can I try to be eloquent on this?
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:19.060]   So, if you give people freedom, if you give people--
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:19.940]   - Politics, yeah.
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.720]   - Well, not politics, relations, relations.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.860]   Relationships.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:27.100]   So, this is interesting 'cause we have
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:28.700]   an interesting dynamic going on here
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.580]   in terms of beliefs, they're differing
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.020]   and there's interesting overlaps.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:37.460]   But there's a worry, if you look at human history
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:38.980]   and you study the lessons of history
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:41.340]   and you look at modern society,
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:44.300]   if you give people freedom in terms of stickiness
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:46.540]   and human relations and so on, full,
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:48.820]   like, if you not give people freedom,
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:53.520]   emphasize freedom as the highest ideal,
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.340]   you start getting more tender, online dating,
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:00.100]   the stickiness dissolves, just like in chemistry.
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:03.380]   You start to have a gas versus a liquid, right?
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.580]   That's the worry.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.420]   So, you have to study what actually happens.
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:13.100]   If you emphasize that the stickiness,
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.820]   the bonds of humans is holding you back,
[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:21.740]   the exercise of voluntary choice is the highest ideal,
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:25.680]   the danger of that is for that to be implemented
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:28.240]   or interpreted in certain kinds of ways
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.320]   by us flawed humans that are not,
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.600]   I mean, you could say we're perfectly reasonable
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.520]   and rational, we can think through all of our decisions,
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:38.660]   but really, I mean, especially you're young,
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:40.160]   you get horny and you make decisions
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:42.520]   that are suboptimal, perhaps.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.440]   So, the point is you have to look at reality
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.280]   of when you emphasize different things.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.340]   So, when you talk about what is the ideal life,
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:56.060]   what is the ideal relations, you have to also think like,
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.340]   what are you emphasizing?
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:00.020]   I think you both agree on what's important,
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:03.620]   that community can be important, that freedom is important,
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:04.980]   but what are you emphasizing?
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:06.980]   And you're really emphasizing the individual
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.660]   and you're emphasizing, Yoram, you're emphasizing
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:16.500]   more of the community, of the family,
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.620]   of the stickiness of the nation.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:22.280]   - Well, look, I don't wanna deny the place of the individual.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:27.280]   I think that there really is a very great change
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:33.200]   in civilization when the books of Moses
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:37.540]   announce that the individual is created in the image of God.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:41.600]   That's a step that's, as far as we know,
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.960]   without precedent before that in history.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.920]   And to a very large degree, I mean,
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:51.280]   one of the kind of unspoken things going on
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.340]   is that Yoram and I really do agree on all sorts of things,
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:59.140]   I think in part because we're both Jewish.
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:04.940]   - You did say Yoram is basically Moses yesterday.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.760]   - No, I said he was channeling Moses,
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:10.180]   but that's still, in my book, that's still pretty--
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:13.560]   - No, that's a compliment, I took it as one.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.600]   - For me, that's a compliment.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.000]   - And we'll talk about this a little bit
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.760]   just for the listener, just so they know,
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.920]   Yoram, amongst many things,
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.980]   we'll talk about the virtue of nationalism,
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:26.520]   but you're also a religious scholar of sorts,
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.840]   or at least leverage the Bible for much,
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.880]   not much, but some of the wisdom in your life.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:36.560]   - Look, the way that Yoram looks at enlightenment,
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.560]   or maybe at Ayn Rand, that's the way that I see
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.420]   the Hebrew scripture and the tradition that comes from it.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:47.480]   It has the same kind of place in my life.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.400]   And I just, I don't know how much we want to explore it,
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.400]   but I think that the agreement that we do have
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:03.000]   about the positive value of the creative individual,
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.160]   the positive value of the individual's desire
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.480]   to improve the world, and in my book,
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:16.220]   that means including his or her desire to improve
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:21.060]   his family, his tribe, his congregation, his nation.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:23.100]   But it still comes from this kind of,
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.940]   from what Yoram calls selfishness,
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.060]   the desire to make things better for yourself.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:32.420]   In Hebrew Bible and in Judaism,
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.420]   that just is a positive thing.
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:35.980]   Of course, it can be taken too far,
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:39.180]   but it just is positive, and it doesn't carry
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:42.720]   these kinds of, you should turn the other cheek,
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.140]   you should give away your cloak, you should love your enemy.
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:48.420]   These kinds of Christian tropes do not exist in Judaism.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:52.220]   And so it just, I like listening to Yoram's,
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:54.500]   I do feel like he goes too far on various things,
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.700]   but I also hear underneath it, I can sort of,
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:01.100]   hear the Jewish current and the resistance
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:06.100]   to things about Christianity that Jews often find.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.460]   - Can I ask you a question there?
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:13.060]   Can you make an argument for turn the other cheek?
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:13.900]   - No.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.180]   - I tend to, I guess you would equate that with altruism.
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.220]   I tend to--
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.460]   - Injustice.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:23.020]   It's unjust to turn the other cheek.
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:23.860]   - I agree.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.020]   - Okay.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:27.540]   - You don't love yourself if you're turning the other cheek.
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.180]   It's a lack of love, lack of self-respect.
[01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:31.660]   - Well, let me push back on that,
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:35.860]   because I like turn the other cheek,
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:36.900]   especially on Twitter.
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:39.220]   So--
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:42.100]   - I like block the offender on Twitter.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:44.340]   (laughing)
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:45.180]   - No, what I,
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:49.300]   so Twitter aside is more like you're,
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:53.940]   you're investing in the long-term version of yourself
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.660]   versus the short-term.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.620]   So that's the way I think about it,
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.740]   is like the energy you put onto the world.
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.780]   The turning of the cheek philosophy
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:04.320]   allows you to walk through the fire gracefully.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.180]   It's some sense.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.780]   I mean, perhaps you would reframe that
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:08.620]   as not a,
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:12.820]   then that's not being altruistic or whatever,
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:15.620]   but there is something pragmatic
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:18.340]   about that kind of approach to life.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.820]   - Disciplining yourself
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:22.300]   so that you become a better version of yourself.
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:24.940]   I mean, I, not only do we agree,
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:29.020]   but I think every religious and philosophical tradition
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:30.860]   probably has a version of that,
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.060]   even Kant, who we join together in finding to be terrible.
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.660]   Even Kant makes that distinction
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:39.140]   between the short-term interest and the long-term interest.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.700]   So I think that's a universal,
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.300]   I don't know of anybody who's really disagreeing about that.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:47.860]   The thing that we were talking about a couple of minutes ago
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:49.320]   before we got onto this tangent
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.340]   is the relationship between the individual
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:55.260]   who is in the image of God
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:49:00.260]   and is of value as an individual.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.300]   Nevertheless, there's this question about what,
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:06.740]   what is good for that person?
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.580]   And also what makes him happy?
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.300]   I'm not sure that those are exactly the same things,
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:15.300]   but they're both certainly relevant and important.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:18.660]   And I feel like, I mean,
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:20.340]   I think we're beginning to uncover
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:21.840]   this empirical disagreement
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.100]   about what it is that's good for the individual
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:25.380]   and what it is that makes him happy.
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:29.300]   And I'll go back to something I raised in the debate,
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.540]   which is this theory of Durkheim
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:37.540]   that now has been popularized by Jordan Peterson.
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:42.580]   But Durkheim argues that the,
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:47.060]   he's writing a book on suicide.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:47.900]   He's trying to understand
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.260]   what brings individuals to suicide.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:54.740]   And he coins this term anomie, lack of law.
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:59.140]   And the argument is that individuals
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:03.080]   basically are healthy and happy
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.740]   when they find their place in a hierarchy,
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:09.540]   within a loyalty group, in a certain place in a hierarchy.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:13.340]   They compete and struggle in order to rise in the hierarchy,
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.240]   but they know where they are.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.180]   They know who they are.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.540]   The kids today like to say
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:19.580]   they know what their identity is
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:22.500]   because they associate themselves,
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:25.940]   their self expands to take on the leadership,
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:28.100]   the different layers, the past and the future
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:29.940]   of this particular hierarchy.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.900]   And I completely agree with Yaron
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:35.500]   that some of these hierarchies are pernicious
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:38.620]   and oppressive and terrible,
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:40.160]   and some of them are better.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.940]   What we might disagree about
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.060]   is that you can find human beings
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:51.740]   who are capable of becoming healthy and happy
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:54.180]   off by themselves without participating
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:55.820]   in this kind of structure.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:59.020]   The minute that you accept, if you accept,
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.260]   that this is empirical reality about human beings,
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:06.620]   it's an iron law, you can't do anything.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.500]   You can tell human beings that they can be free
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.620]   of all constraints, all you want,
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:14.940]   and you can get them to do things that,
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.700]   as you say, dissolve their,
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:19.460]   that they can have contempt for hierarchies.
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.740]   They can say, "I'm not gonna serve the man.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:25.020]   I'm going to, you know, I'm just gonna burn them all down."
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:27.620]   You can get them to say all,
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:29.180]   get kids to say all of these things.
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:31.260]   You can get them either to be Marxists
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:34.460]   who are actively trying to overthrow
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.340]   and destroy the existing hierarchies,
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:38.060]   or you can make them some kind of liberal
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.220]   where they basically pretend the hierarchies don't exist.
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:43.500]   They just act like they're not there.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.940]   In both cases, and it's not a coincidence
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.380]   that that's what universities teach,
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:49.980]   is your choice is either Marxist revolution
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:52.480]   or liberal ignoring of the hierarchies.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.780]   In both cases, what you've done
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.260]   is you've eliminated the possibility
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:03.260]   that the young person will be able to find his or her place
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:06.940]   in a way that allows them to grow and exercise
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:10.380]   their love, their drive, their creativity
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:13.580]   in order to advance something constructive.
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:17.620]   You've eliminated it, and you've put the burden on them,
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:20.060]   you know, kind of a Nietzschean burden,
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:25.060]   to just be the fountain of all values yourself,
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.940]   which, you know, maybe some people can do it,
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.580]   but almost no one can do it,
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.340]   and I think that's empirically true.
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:36.340]   And so I think by telling them about their freedom
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:40.020]   rather than telling them about the need
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:43.640]   to join into some traditionalist hierarchy
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:45.640]   that can be good and healthy for them,
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.260]   I think we're destroying them.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.140]   I think we're destroying this generation
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:51.420]   and the last one and the next.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:56.420]   - Yaron, is the burden of freedom destroying mankind?
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:58.380]   - What freedom?
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:01.740]   I mean, how many people are indeed free?
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.320]   Look, the problem is that we're caught up
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:09.320]   on political concepts, and we're moving into ethical issues,
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:14.620]   and I don't think it's right to tell people,
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:17.620]   you're free, go do whatever the hell you want.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:20.060]   Just use your emotions, you know,
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.500]   just go where you wanna go, you know,
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:23.380]   in the spur of the moment.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.100]   Think short term, don't think long term,
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.340]   or don't think, why think?
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.980]   One has to provide moral guidance,
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:34.300]   and morality here is crucial and crucially important.
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.140]   And part of taking responsibility for your own life
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:41.380]   is establishing a moral framework for your life,
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:44.460]   and what does it mean to live a good life?
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:46.580]   I mean, that's much more important in the sense
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:49.900]   of a question, and it is my belief
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.420]   that people can do that.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:55.340]   They can find and choose the values necessary
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:57.340]   to achieve a good life, but they need guidance.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.560]   They need guidance.
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.520]   This is why religion evolved, in my view,
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.580]   because people need guidance.
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:04.580]   So, you know, I had called religion
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:06.040]   a primitive form of philosophy.
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:08.740]   It was the original philosophy that provided people
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:11.380]   with some guidance about what to do and what not to do,
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:14.360]   and secular philosophy is supposed to do the same,
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.820]   and the problem is that I think religion
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:22.620]   and 99% of secular philosophy give people bad advice
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:25.300]   about what to do, and therefore, they do bad stuff.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:29.340]   And some of that, sometimes, you know,
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:32.560]   because when they do good stuff, it gets reinforced
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.940]   that we survive in spite of that,
[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:38.100]   but ideas like Kant and Hegel and Marx and so on
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:40.940]   give young people awful advice about how to live
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:42.580]   and what to do, and as a consequence,
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.820]   really bad stuff happens.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:45.820]   And the world in which we exist today,
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:50.060]   which we agree there are a lot of pathologies to it,
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.820]   there are a lot of bad stuff going on,
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.260]   in my view is going the wrong way.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:57.680]   In my view, a product of a set of ideas,
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.980]   on the one hand, I think Christian ideas,
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:04.700]   on the other hand, I think secular philosophical ideas
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:07.700]   that have driven this country and the world more generally
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.580]   in a really, really bad direction,
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.860]   and this is why I do what I do,
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.100]   because I think at the core of it,
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:18.200]   the only way to change it is not to impose
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.700]   a new set of ideas from the top,
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.460]   because I worry about who's gonna be doing the imposition,
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:25.920]   plus I don't believe you can force people to be good,
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.060]   it's to challenge the ideas, it's to question the ideas,
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:32.140]   it's to present an alternative view of morality,
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:34.900]   an alternative set of moral principles,
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:36.220]   an alternative, ultimately,
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:38.140]   an alternative view of political principles.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:39.700]   But it has to start with morality.
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:43.140]   If you don't, and my morality's centered on the individual
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.660]   and what the individual should do with his life
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.880]   in order to attain a good life,
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.540]   I believe that leads to happiness,
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:52.620]   but the good life, that's why it's good, right?
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:56.100]   The goal is survival and thriving and flourishing
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.820]   and happiness, ultimately.
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:01.860]   But politics is a servant of that in the end.
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.240]   It's not an end in itself.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.660]   So the real issue is, you asked before,
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.340]   what is the value of relationship?
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:09.780]   There's an enormous value in relationship
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:11.140]   because we get values from other people.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.540]   We don't produce all our values.
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:14.580]   We don't produce all our spiritual values,
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:16.860]   and we don't produce all our material values.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:20.580]   Other people are a massive benefit to us
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.100]   because they produce values we can't.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.980]   There's a massive division of labor in terms of values,
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:28.600]   not just in economics, but also in philosophy and elsewhere.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.900]   It's why we have teachers, it's why we have moral teachers.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.300]   Moral teachers are important to help guide us
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.400]   towards a good life.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.020]   Not all of us are philosophers.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:39.540]   But what I do demand, if you will, of individuals,
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:41.980]   this is where I put a burden on people, right?
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.500]   Understand what you're doing, right?
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:47.900]   You know, don't embrace a moral teaching
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.900]   because it was tradition.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:51.500]   Don't embrace a moral teaching
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.020]   because your parents embraced it.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.340]   Don't embrace a moral teaching
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.300]   just because your teachers are teaching it.
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.060]   Challenge it, think about it.
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:01.780]   Embrace it because you embrace it.
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:04.500]   You might be wrong, you might embrace the wrong one,
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.180]   but take moral responsibility.
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:09.940]   Take responsibility over your life by evaluating,
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:13.940]   testing, challenging what you have received
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:18.540]   and choosing what you're gonna pursue.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:22.220]   And I acknowledge empirically that most people don't do that
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:27.020]   and this is why intellectual leadership is so important.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:31.460]   This is why you want the voices in a culture
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:34.300]   to be good voices so that those people
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.340]   who don't think for themselves land up being followers,
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:39.060]   but they end up being followers of somebody good
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.260]   versus followers of somebody bad.
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:43.940]   But for the thinkers in the world out there,
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:45.620]   who I think are the people who count,
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.140]   who the people who shape society.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:47.980]   - Oh boy.
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:49.340]   No, no, shape society.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:51.020]   - Wait a minute, not count in a sense
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.700]   that you can dismiss the lives of others
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:54.500]   and you know, because I'm, you know,
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.380]   obviously I'm anti-coercion and anti-violence.
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.820]   - You sound like Plato.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.380]   - Yes, I don't wanna sound like Plato.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:02.180]   But in a sense that they're the ones
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.940]   who land up shaping the world.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:06.820]   They're the ones who land up shaping how the world is.
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:10.340]   I want those people to make choices about their values
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:12.940]   and not to just accept them based on tradition
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:15.100]   or based on commandment or based on
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:16.740]   where they happen to grow up.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:20.260]   And in that sense, again, you know, I do,
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:24.020]   and this is an interesting point where we disagree,
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:26.420]   but I'm not exactly sure what your position is.
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:27.980]   I do believe in universal values.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:30.060]   That is, there are things that are good
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:31.340]   and there are things that are evil.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:32.700]   And I think we'd agree on that.
[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:35.540]   And there are systems, we agree that communism
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.940]   and fascism are evil.
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.700]   Well, I think we should be able to agree
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:41.020]   that some political systems are good.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.860]   And maybe there's this middle ground
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:47.020]   where we both think that they're not particularly bad,
[01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:47.900]   but not particularly good.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:50.380]   And you all might think that better than I think they are.
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:54.420]   But if we can agree on this is good and this is evil, right?
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.060]   Then the systems that tend towards the good are good
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.100]   and the systems that tend towards the evil are evil.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:01.620]   But that's universal, right?
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:07.340]   I look at places like South Korea, Japan, Asia,
[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:09.020]   cultures that are very, very different
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:10.700]   in many respects in the West.
[01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:15.700]   And yet when they adopt certain Western ideas, right,
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:19.180]   about freedom, about liberty, about individualism,
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:20.380]   I mean, the Japanese constitution,
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.820]   because MacArthur forced it in there,
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:24.180]   has the pursuit of happiness in the constitution,
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:26.300]   not because they chose it because he put it in there,
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:28.660]   but they, to some extent, adopted that
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:32.620]   and they're successful places today.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:35.820]   Those societies in Asia that didn't adopt these values
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:37.500]   are not successful societies today.
[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:42.500]   - Yaron, Japan has a birth rate of, what is it?
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:47.420]   1.1, 1.2 children per woman.
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:52.100]   I mean, look, there are some things,
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:55.180]   there are some places where you give people freedom.
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:57.460]   This is also biblical, right?
[01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:01.140]   The idea that everyone did what's right in his own eyes.
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:01.980]   Okay, right?
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.460]   This is a refrain in the book of Judges.
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:09.060]   And the Bible is not an anti-freedom book.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:11.300]   I mean, there's many, many, look, I--
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:12.380]   - Well, let's talk--
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:13.620]   - No, we're not, fine.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:14.620]   - We'll get there.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.300]   - Okay, look-- - Oh, he's gonna guide us in.
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:18.260]   - Okay, look, just as an asterisk,
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:21.060]   I'm not asking you because the Bible
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:22.980]   is such a great authoritarian book.
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:24.540]   It's not that at all.
[02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:29.540]   In my view, if you wanna know where this,
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:33.100]   what you call the sanctity of property,
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.220]   where does the sanctity of property comes from?
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:36.540]   It comes from the 10 Commandments.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:38.620]   It comes from Moses saying,
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:40.220]   "I haven't taken anything from anyone."
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:41.140]   It comes from Samuel saying,
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.780]   "I haven't taken anything from anyone."
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:45.700]   It's the condemnation of Ahab, of the unjust kings
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:49.340]   who steal the property of their subjects.
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:53.180]   So I'm not, so property and freedom,
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:57.100]   I think there's great basis for it in the Bible.
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:01:01.060]   But right now, I'm focusing on this other question,
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:04.220]   which is what happens when everyone does
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:05.420]   what's right in his own eyes?
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:06.580]   That's the book of Judges,
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:10.620]   and that's this civil war, moral corruption,
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:14.260]   theft, idolatry, murder, rape.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.460]   I mean, that's what happens when everyone does
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:19.260]   whatever's right in his own eyes.
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.740]   Well, no, that's what it says in the text.
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:25.420]   I'm not, okay, so when I look at, you're right,
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:28.340]   there are things that I think are objectively true.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:32.420]   I think it's really hard to get people to agree to them,
[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:33.820]   almost impossible.
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:38.820]   But when I look at a country which is approaching
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:44.140]   one birth per woman, in other words,
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:48.300]   half of the minimum necessary for replacement,
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:49.700]   you can say whatever you want,
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:51.420]   whatever you want about immigration,
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:52.780]   we can have that discussion.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:57.740]   But the point is that when your values are such
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.180]   that you're not even capable of doing
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:02.860]   the most basic techniques that human beings need
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:04.860]   in order to be able to propagate themselves
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:07.740]   and their values and the way they see things,
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:09.820]   then, look, you're finished.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.660]   You can't say that, you can't--
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:13.820]   - So if I implied that Japan is an ideal society,
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:15.380]   I take that back.
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:17.940]   But let's think about Japan for a minute.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:19.340]   - I just think we're in trouble,
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:20.540]   and we're in trouble--
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:23.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me a second, hold you to that.
[02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:24.660]   - Being the tutorial.
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:26.100]   - No, I'm sorry.
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:27.420]   - It's his show, man.
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:31.020]   We enter into his hierarchy, and that's it.
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.660]   - We should talk about hierarchy.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:38.380]   - Just to clarify, how do you explain
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:39.420]   the situation in Japan?
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:41.580]   Is it the decrease in value in family?
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.860]   Like some of the, just expand on that.
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:46.660]   How do you explain that situation?
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:49.540]   You're saying that society is in trouble
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:50.620]   in a certain way.
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:53.380]   Can you kind of describe the nature of that trouble?
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:57.380]   - I'm saying that when the individual
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:02.020]   is part of a social group, this can be a family,
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:05.580]   a congregation, a community, a tribe, a nation,
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:08.740]   when the individual feels that the things
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:10.380]   that are happening to the society
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:13.540]   are things that are happening to him or to her,
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:17.100]   and I wanna emphasize, this is not the standard view
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:21.820]   of collectivism that Mussolini will say,
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.620]   the glory of the individual is in totally immersing himself
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:27.060]   in the organic whole.
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:28.260]   That's not what I'm saying.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:32.300]   I'm saying that human beings have and are both.
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:36.060]   They enter into a society to which they are loyal,
[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:38.900]   and they compete with one another
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:43.420]   in the terms that that society allows competition,
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:45.340]   but also sometimes by bending the rules
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:48.380]   and by shaping them and by changing them.
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.540]   What you see in many societies,
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:53.780]   certainly throughout the liberal West,
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:56.140]   but also in countries that have been affected
[02:03:56.140 --> 02:03:58.340]   by the liberal West, by industrialization
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:00.580]   and ideas of individualism,
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:04.460]   what you see is a collapse of a willingness
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:09.460]   of the individual to look at what is needed by the whole
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:14.340]   and to make choices that are,
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:17.420]   Jorn would call them selfish,
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:21.300]   because the purpose of them is self-expression,
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:24.600]   competition, self-assertion, moving up in the hierarchy,
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:31.460]   achieving honor or wealth in order to do those things,
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:36.500]   but when you stop being able to look at the framework
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:39.260]   of a particular society and identify with it,
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:42.700]   you lose, you cease to understand
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:44.460]   what it is that you need to do.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.180]   Not every single person,
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:48.020]   but I'm talking about society-wide.
[02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:50.140]   So there are few individuals who are just gonna have
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:52.260]   a fantastic time and live the kind of life
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:53.580]   that Jorn is describing,
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:56.940]   and the great majority, they stop being willing
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:59.740]   to take risks, they stop being willing to get married,
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:01.380]   they stop being willing to have children,
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.260]   they stop being willing to start companies,
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:05.380]   they stop being willing to put themselves out
[02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:09.260]   to do great things, because the guide rails
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:11.660]   that told them what kinds of things,
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:14.820]   and the social feedback that honored them
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:16.820]   when they did things like getting married
[02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:18.900]   and having children, they've been crushed.
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:20.300]   And what have they been crushed by?
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:23.340]   They've been crushed by the false view
[02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:24.740]   that if you tell the individual,
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:27.300]   be free, make all your own decisions,
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:28.260]   that they will then be free
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:29.320]   and make all their own decisions.
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:32.180]   They don't, they just stop, they stop being human.
[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:36.020]   - That's powerful, so do you wanna respond to that?
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:38.100]   - Yes. (laughs)
[02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.780]   So I don't think anybody should have children.
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:45.620]   If the goal, there's a good tweet.
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:46.460]   - Clip that out.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:48.020]   - A tweet clip that you could make.
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:50.060]   (laughing)
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:51.740]   I don't think anybody should have children
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:55.980]   for the goal of perpetuating their nation
[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:59.700]   or expanding their society, or for some,
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:03.060]   I think they'd make horrible parents
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:06.060]   if that was the goal, the purpose of doing it.
[02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:07.900]   I think people should have children
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.900]   because they wanna embrace that challenge,
[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:14.300]   that beauty, that experience,
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.580]   that amazing, very, very hard,
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:19.140]   very, very difficult experience in life.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:21.940]   It's about being able to project the long-term,
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:24.700]   but also being able to enjoy and love
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:26.500]   the creation of another human being,
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:27.940]   that process of creation.
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:30.100]   It is a beautiful, self-interested thing.
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.220]   And by the way, not everybody should have children.
[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:34.700]   I think way too many people have children.
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:36.060]   There's some awful parents out there
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.380]   that I wish would stop.
[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:39.460]   I mean, there are.
[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:43.620]   Life is precious, and life of suffering is sad.
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:45.220]   It's sad to see people suffering.
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:46.980]   A lot of people are born into situations
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:51.140]   and born into parents that destroy their capacity
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.220]   to ever live a good life,
[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.940]   and that's a tragic and sad thing.
[02:06:54.940 --> 02:07:02.020]   So I don't measure the health of a society
[02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:03.660]   in how many children they're having,
[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:05.060]   or a health of a couple,
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.580]   of whether they have children or not.
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:07.700]   Those are individual choices.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:10.780]   Some people make a choice not to have children,
[02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:12.420]   which is completely rational and consistent
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.820]   with their values.
[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:15.820]   Now, when you look at a society overall,
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:18.420]   I do think having children or not having children
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:20.260]   is a reflection of something.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.140]   I think it's a reflection of a certain optimism
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:22.980]   about the future.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:24.540]   I think it's a reflection of thinking
[02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:26.220]   long-term versus short-term.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.180]   I think a short-term society doesn't have children.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:29.500]   People don't have children there
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.100]   because children are a long-term investment.
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:35.860]   They require real planning and real effort
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:37.900]   and real thinking about the long-term,
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:39.620]   but those are moral issues.
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:43.300]   And again, we're confusing or mixing.
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.740]   When I say Japan, look how well Japan has done.
[02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:48.500]   I don't mean the specific Japanese people
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:49.500]   and how many kids they're having
[02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:51.420]   and what kind of life they're having
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:53.820]   in terms of these kind of particulars,
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:56.260]   but think about the alternatives Japan faces.
[02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:59.260]   If you look around, the options, right,
[02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:02.580]   that they face, they tried empire,
[02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:04.140]   they tried nationalistic empire.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.660]   It didn't turn out too well for them
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:08.220]   or anybody who they interacted with.
[02:08:08.220 --> 02:08:10.700]   They could have become North Korea.
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:12.020]   We know how that turned out.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:12.860]   We know what that is.
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:13.780]   They could have been Cambodia.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:14.820]   If you've ever been to Cambodia
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.300]   and seen the kind of poverty,
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:18.900]   and yes, maybe Cambodians have lots of children,
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:21.940]   but God, I'd rather be in Japan any day
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:24.460]   than have children in the kind of poverty
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:27.140]   and horrific circumstances they have.
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:31.340]   But in the context of the available regimes
[02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:34.220]   that were possible post-World War II
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:35.700]   for the Japanese to embrace,
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:39.180]   they embraced one that generally led to prosperity,
[02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:41.620]   to freedom, to individuals pursuing values,
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:44.340]   not perfectly because they didn't implement
[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:45.980]   the philosophical foundation,
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:48.820]   the moral foundation that I would like them to have.
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:52.580]   They're still being impacted by Kantian, Hegelian,
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:55.020]   whatever philosophy that's out there in the West
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:57.380]   that's destroying the better part.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:59.100]   So you give people freedom.
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:00.620]   Now, what do they do with it?
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:02.620]   And if they have a bad philosophy,
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:05.340]   they're gonna do bad things with that freedom, right?
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:08.580]   You tell people to do whatever they choose to do,
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.020]   but if they have bad ideas,
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:12.820]   they will choose to do bad things.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:15.820]   So it is true that the primacy of morality
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:19.220]   and the primacy of philosophy has to be recognized.
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.540]   It's not the primacy of politics.
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:24.220]   And indeed, you don't get free societies
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:29.020]   unless you have some elements of decent philosophy,
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:32.020]   but you can get free societies with a rotten philosophy,
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.980]   but they don't stay free for very long.
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:36.780]   - I don't understand how can it be a decent philosophy
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:39.580]   if it doesn't care about posterity?
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:44.580]   If you're willing to say, "I'm offering guidance.
[02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:46.580]   "I think you should live as a trader.
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:48.540]   "All relationships should be voluntary."
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.420]   Those are interesting things,
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:53.180]   but the moment that it comes to posterity,
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.580]   to the future, to there being a future,
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:58.100]   let's say that there were a society that lived the way,
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:59.980]   you know, in general, according to your view,
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:01.860]   let's say there was such a society.
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.860]   How can you not care whether that society's capable
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:06.980]   of passing it on to the next generation or not?
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:08.740]   - But the way to pass it on to the next generation
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:11.700]   is through ideas and not through having children.
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:13.620]   Having children is an individual choice
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:15.660]   that some people are going to make and some people are not,
[02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:19.460]   but the fundamental that preserves the good life.
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:20.780]   - What does that even mean?
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:22.860]   - There's a sense in which.
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:25.060]   If every generation from now on,
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:28.100]   your society that was good at a certain point
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:29.860]   has half as many people in it,
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:33.580]   it's going to very quickly, it's just going to be overrun.
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:34.660]   - Overrun by whom?
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.180]   - What do you mean overrun by whom?
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:38.220]   Are we just totally ahistorical?
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:40.580]   If you're the Spartans and you have all of these,
[02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:42.860]   you know, like warrior values,
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:45.300]   but you stop having children, you get overrun.
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:46.140]   You get defeated.
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:47.140]   - In the case of Sparta, that's a good thing,
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:47.980]   not a bad thing, but I get it.
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:49.220]   - That's not my point.
[02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:52.780]   You have to have the ability to have enough children
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:55.820]   to create enough wealth and enough power, enough strength.
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:58.740]   - Who makes these kind of conclusions and decisions
[02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:01.140]   about how many you make it as an individual
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:03.380]   and you decide that in order to.
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:04.740]   - No, we're not talking about,
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:06.900]   we're talking about what kind of intellectual,
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:10.300]   cultural, religious inheritance you give your children.
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:13.380]   - Yes, and those are the ideas that I give my children
[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:15.140]   and those ideas are going to perpetuate
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.100]   because they're good ideas.
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:16.940]   If they're bad ideas.
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:19.180]   - No, they're not going to perpetuate.
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:20.780]   They can't be good ideas
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:23.060]   if they don't produce future generations.
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:23.900]   What are you talking about?
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:25.980]   - Why would they not produce future generations?
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:26.820]   I mean, as I said.
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:29.940]   - Because look at every liberal society on earth
[02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:32.220]   is in democratic collapse.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:34.900]   - There's not a single liberal society on earth today
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:36.700]   that I'm willing to defend
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:38.900]   because they're not living by my philosophy.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:40.780]   They do not accept my ideas.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:42.300]   They have a semblance.
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:45.540]   They have a semblance of a political system
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:47.540]   that is a little bit like what I would like,
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:48.860]   far from what I would ideal.
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:49.700]   - I know all of this.
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:51.700]   - I certainly don't have a moral foundation.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.220]   I believe that people who have the right moral foundation,
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:55.780]   most of them, not all of them,
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:57.260]   but most of them will have children.
[02:11:57.260 --> 02:12:00.060]   Most of them will continue into the future.
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.020]   Most of them will fight for a future,
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:06.180]   but not because they care what happens in 200 years,
[02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:07.860]   but because they care about their lifetime
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:11.100]   and part of having fun and enjoying one's lifetime
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:15.060]   is having kids, is projecting into the future.
[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.380]   - Are you really going to tell me
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:19.020]   that people have children because it's fun?
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:20.500]   They're fun when they're four years old.
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:22.780]   They're not fun when they're 15.
[02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:24.460]   - When they're 15, they're not fun.
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:25.300]   I agree with that.
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.140]   - No, they're just not fun.
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:26.980]   Look, you don't do this.
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:27.820]   - I'm learning so much today.
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:31.060]   - Look, you don't do this for fun.
[02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:32.540]   Marriage also you don't do for fun.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:33.580]   There are times that are fun
[02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:35.260]   and there are times that are not fun.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:36.100]   Look, the Talmud--
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.700]   - Fun is not exactly the right word,
[02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:40.220]   but you certainly do it for happiness.
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:41.940]   You do it for fulfillment.
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:43.700]   You do it as a challenge.
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:47.860]   You do it for making your life better,
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.340]   for making your life interesting,
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:52.100]   for making your life challenging, for embracing.
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:56.140]   Part of it is fun, part of it is hard work,
[02:12:56.140 --> 02:13:01.140]   but you do it because it makes your life a better life.
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:02.740]   - That's very interesting.
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:04.020]   So empirically speaking,
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:07.140]   if you dissolve the cultural backbone
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:08.140]   where everybody comes up,
[02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:11.180]   like the background, the moral ideas
[02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:12.340]   that everybody is raised with,
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:13.300]   if you dissolve that
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:16.100]   and if you truly emphasize the individual,
[02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:21.060]   I think Yoram is saying it's going to naturally lead
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:23.820]   to the dissolution of marriage and all of these concepts.
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:25.980]   - I think that's not true.
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.620]   - Well, basically saying you're not going
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.020]   to choose some of these things.
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.780]   You're going to more and more choose
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:34.900]   the short-term optimization
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:37.460]   versus the long-term optimization
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:40.540]   beyond your own life, like posterity.
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:42.060]   - So I don't think about posterity.
[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:43.660]   I don't know what posterity means.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.900]   I can project into my children's life,
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:47.740]   maybe when I have grandchildren
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:49.860]   into the grandchildren's life, but it ends there.
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:51.780]   I can't project 300 years into the future.
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:53.420]   It's ridiculous to try to think
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:54.660]   about 300 years into the future.
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:55.860]   Things change so much.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:58.420]   - But that's the founding fathers.
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:00.020]   That's the conservative founding fathers.
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:01.180]   - Well, no, I don't think.
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:02.540]   I think they set up a system.
[02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:04.660]   I think the whole idea was to set up a system
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:06.300]   that was self-perpetuating
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:10.140]   that would if people lived up to it, right?
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:10.980]   - No, no.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:11.940]   - Would perpetuate the self-interference.
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:13.980]   - No systems are self-perpetuating.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:15.660]   Things rise and fall and it's--
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.100]   - They don't necessarily rise and fall.
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:17.940]   I don't believe in that.
[02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:20.660]   - Let me speak to your heart for a second.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:24.500]   The great individuals in societies
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:26.820]   are the people who have seen the decline,
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:29.620]   understood it, and provided resources
[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:32.060]   in order to redirect and bring it back up.
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:33.300]   You can't agree to that?
[02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:36.140]   - I don't see it that way at all.
[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:39.300]   Yes, I want people out there
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:41.460]   to rebel against conventional morality.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:43.220]   I think conventional morality is destructive
[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:46.060]   to their own lives and broadly to posterity
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.100]   because I think it's unsustainable, it's not good,
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:50.460]   and this goes to, I think, conventional morality.
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.380]   It's Christian morality.
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.380]   It's a morality that's been secularized
[02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:55.780]   through Christian lens, and I think it's destructive.
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.300]   But I don't want them to dump that
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:59.500]   and not replace it with something.
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:03.260]   I want, and I think it's necessary and essential
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.140]   for people to have a moral code
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:07.620]   and to have a moral quote.
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:10.980]   Morality is a set of guidelines to live your life.
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:14.180]   It is a set of values to guide you,
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:15.500]   to help you identify what is good for you
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:16.340]   and what is bad for you.
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:17.180]   - Here's the thing.
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:18.260]   Let me argue against you.
[02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:19.860]   Let me, hold on a second.
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:23.500]   You're saying central to this morality
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.540]   that people should have is reason.
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:26.380]   - Yes.
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:27.220]   - Okay.
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:28.300]   You're not saying other things.
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:31.460]   You're basically saying reason will arrive
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:32.580]   at a lot of things.
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:35.980]   Why are you so sure that reason is so important?
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.180]   - There's nothing else.
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:38.020]   - No, hold on a second.
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:40.620]   But it seems obvious to you.
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:43.340]   So first of all, humans have limited cognitive capacity.
[02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:46.940]   So even to assume the reason can actually function that well
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:50.980]   from an artificial intelligence researcher perspective,
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:52.660]   this seems--
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:54.180]   - There's a whole discussion about whether there is
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.860]   such a thing as artificial intelligence,
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:57.780]   whether that is what it is.
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:15:59.740]   - But see, here's the thing.
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:02.180]   I mean, you're very confident about this particular thing,
[02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:04.300]   but not about other aspects of human nature
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:06.260]   that seems to be obviously present.
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:11.260]   So yes, almost human relations, love,
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:12.780]   connection between us.
[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:14.940]   So it's very possible to argue
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:17.820]   that all of the accomplishments of reason would not exist
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:19.580]   without the connection of other humans.
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:20.420]   That it's very--
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:21.260]   - Of course that's true.
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:22.220]   - It's not obvious though.
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:26.660]   It's possible that reason is a property of the collective
[02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:29.020]   of multiple people interacting with each other.
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:31.620]   When you look at the greatest inventions of human history,
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:34.900]   some people tell that story by individual inventors.
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:36.300]   You could argue that's true.
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:39.900]   Some people say that it's a bunch of people
[02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:41.100]   in the room together.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:42.380]   The idea is bubbling.
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:46.220]   And if you're saying individual is primary
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:48.740]   and they have the full power and the capacity
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:51.900]   to make choices, I don't know if that's necessarily
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:52.740]   obviously true.
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:54.620]   - So there's a straw manning going on here
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:56.020]   of my position, right?
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:56.860]   - Yep.
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:57.700]   - Of course--
[02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:58.540]   - My favorite thing to do.
[02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:00.220]   (laughing)
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:02.180]   - You don't do it and you do it more politely
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:04.020]   than anybody else I know when you do it.
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.380]   Of course we all stand on the shoulders of giants.
[02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:10.580]   Of course invention and science is collaborative.
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:13.740]   Not always, not 100%.
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:16.020]   Newton stood on the shoulders of giants.
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:17.660]   I don't know how collaborative he was.
[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:20.140]   He wasn't exactly known as a bubbling up
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:22.820]   and testing ideas out with other people.
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:24.780]   But this is a metaphysical fact.
[02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:26.060]   You can't eat for me.
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:28.260]   There's no collective stomach.
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:29.980]   You can't eat for me.
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:31.980]   You know, you can provide me with food,
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:33.260]   but I need to do the eating.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:35.140]   You can't think for me.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:37.340]   You can help stimulate my thought.
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.100]   You can challenge my thinking.
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:40.940]   You can add to it.
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:43.420]   But in the end of the day, only I can either do my thinking
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:45.500]   or not do my thinking, but I need to think.
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.060]   - But you can think all by yourself alone.
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:50.220]   - What does that mean, all by yourself, right?
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:51.940]   Can I think on a desert island?
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:53.980]   Yes, I can think on a desert island.
[02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:58.980]   Can I think as big and as broad and as deep as I can
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:03.460]   in Aristotle's Lyceum?
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:04.300]   Of course not.
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:06.740]   I'm a much better thinker in Aristotle's Lyceum
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:09.420]   or in any kind of situation like this
[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:11.540]   where you're gonna challenge me and I have to come back
[02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:14.140]   and I have to think deeply about what it is you said
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:15.980]   and why I'm not communicating very effectively
[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:18.420]   and why you're not understanding me.
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:21.300]   Of course, now you're causing me to think much more deeply
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:23.020]   and to challenge me, but it's still true
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:24.540]   that I have to think.
[02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:26.020]   And if I don't think for myself,
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:27.740]   who's gonna think for me, right?
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:32.220]   So this is why I'm not a philosopher.
[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:35.100]   I'm certainly not an original thinker in that sense.
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:38.460]   I recognize the fact that there are geniuses
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:39.980]   that are much smarter than me,
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.500]   whether it's Aristotle or Ayn Rand
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:43.340]   or people that inspire me.
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:44.740]   I study their work.
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:46.700]   I try to understand it to the best of my ability,
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:49.300]   but I don't take it as gospel.
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:53.180]   I take it as this is something I need to figure out.
[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:54.220]   I need to learn it.
[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:56.580]   I need to understand it because it's good for my life.
[02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:59.780]   It's important to me, but I have to do the thinking.
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:01.860]   It won't be mine.
[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:03.540]   It'll be Ayn Rand's, but it won't be mine
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:05.660]   unless I've done the thinking to integrate it
[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:10.220]   into my soul, into my consciousness, into my mind.
[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:12.700]   But it's still true that I have to think for myself,
[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:13.860]   not on a desert island.
[02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:18.860]   I now regret ever using a desert island in the book
[02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:20.780]   as an example because-
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:23.340]   - We've achieved something.
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:24.180]   - We've achieved something.
[02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:25.020]   - You're all masterfully fired up.
[02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:27.340]   - Progress, we're moving, progress towards truth
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.180]   is taking place.
[02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:30.740]   - Because clearly it was misunderstood.
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:32.780]   I didn't make myself clear enough in the book
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.940]   in terms of what I meant.
[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:38.940]   But I do not advocate for thinking alone in a dark room,
[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:43.460]   not engaging with reality, not studying history,
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:46.020]   not knowing about the world, or on a desert island,
[02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:46.860]   not interacting with other people.
[02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:47.900]   - So you're a collectivist?
[02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:49.580]   - No, I'm a trader.
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:51.860]   So I enjoy what we're doing right now
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:53.340]   because you're challenging me.
[02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:55.340]   You make me a better thinker.
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:58.660]   It's interesting, the fact that a lot of people
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:01.340]   are gonna watch this plays into it as well.
[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:03.820]   But I would probably enjoy engaging with you
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:04.660]   in conversation.
[02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:05.500]   - It's not even recording, so.
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:06.540]   - Yeah, there you go.
[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:09.860]   I would enjoy engaging with you in conversation
[02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.580]   even if it wasn't being recorded.
[02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:15.340]   And even if it was because that kind of conversation
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.180]   makes me better.
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:17.260]   There's some people who I wouldn't.
[02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:19.580]   There's some people who make it worse, right?
[02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:22.140]   That you walk away from the conversation
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:23.700]   because they're harmful to you.
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:26.060]   And this is where choice comes in.
[02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:28.540]   I want to be able to choose who I engage with.
[02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:29.860]   I don't always have that choice
[02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:31.660]   because as a public intellectual,
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:32.660]   you go in front of audiences,
[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:34.540]   you don't always choose who it is.
[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:37.540]   But you wanna choose who you engage with and who you don't.
[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:40.420]   You wanna choose the forum in which you engage
[02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:41.340]   and how you engage.
[02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:43.180]   And the standard for me is reason.
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:44.020]   There is no other standard.
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.220]   So you asked a deep question to start off.
[02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.780]   Why reason, right?
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:50.580]   Because that's where the values come from.
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:53.300]   That's the only tool we have to discover truth.
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:57.540]   Yes, reason is something that it doesn't guarantee truth.
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.700]   It doesn't guarantee the world is right.
[02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:01.020]   It's fallible.
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:01.980]   But it's all we have.
[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:05.260]   It's the tool in which we evaluate the world around us
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:07.020]   and we come to conclusions about it.
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:09.060]   There just isn't other tool.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:13.820]   Emotions are not tools of cognition.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:16.220]   - Consciousness is a tool.
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:19.220]   Emotion, like love, all of these things
[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:21.340]   are ways to experience the world.
[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:23.900]   To say that reason is the best tool--
[02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:26.660]   - But there's a difference between experiencing the world
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:29.700]   and evaluating the world in terms of what is truth
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:30.540]   or what is not.
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:32.780]   - As a scientist, I appreciate the value of reason.
[02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:36.140]   - And emotions and love are consequences.
[02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:37.420]   They're not primary.
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:40.620]   Emotions are consequences of conclusions you've come to.
[02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:44.580]   Your emotions will change very quickly, relatively speaking,
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:47.540]   when your evaluations of a situation will change.
[02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:49.700]   Different people can see exactly the same scene
[02:21:49.700 --> 02:21:51.580]   and have completely different emotions
[02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:53.900]   because they're bringing different value systems
[02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:56.340]   and they're bringing different thoughts to the process.
[02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:59.060]   - Maybe love is primary, but let me ask--
[02:21:59.060 --> 02:21:59.900]   - Love is the same thing.
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:01.160]   You can fall out of love with somebody.
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:02.000]   Why?
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:02.820]   'Cause you learn something new
[02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:05.180]   because you've discovered something new about the person.
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:06.020]   Now you don't love them anymore.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.620]   - This is the wrong podcast to bring up love.
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:09.060]   We'll talk forever about it.
[02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:13.580]   So, Yoram, you wrote the book "The Virtue of Nationalism,"
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:16.220]   contrasting nation states with empires
[02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:18.820]   and with global governance like United Nations and so on.
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:23.740]   So, you argue that nationalism uniquely provides the,
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:26.660]   quote, "The collective right of a free people
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:28.020]   "to rule themselves."
[02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.460]   So, continuing our conversation,
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:35.340]   why is this particular collection of humans
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:39.340]   we call a nation a uniquely powerful way
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:41.360]   to preserve the freedom of a people
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.740]   to have people rule themselves?
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:45.340]   - Before I say anything on the subject,
[02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:49.060]   I should emphasize that I'm not a rationalist.
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:52.020]   I'm an empiricist, and I'm offering
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:57.020]   what I think is a valid observation of human history.
[02:22:57.020 --> 02:23:00.220]   I don't have some kind of deductive framework
[02:23:00.220 --> 02:23:03.300]   for proving that the nation is the best.
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:05.140]   And empirically, we know something
[02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:07.380]   about the way systems of national states work
[02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:08.660]   and about the way empires work
[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:10.620]   and the way tribal societies work.
[02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:14.300]   What we don't know is, you know,
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:16.380]   is it possible to invent something else?
[02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:18.540]   Or, I mean, there's a lot of things we don't know here.
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:22.900]   So, with the caveat that I'm making an empirical observation,
[02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:27.900]   the basic argument is human beings form collectives naturally
[02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:32.020]   loyalty groups, and for most of human history
[02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:34.580]   and prehistory, as far as we know,
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:36.500]   human beings lived in tribal societies.
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:38.220]   Tribal societies are societies
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:43.980]   in which there's constant friction
[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:47.260]   and constant warfare among very small groups,
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:49.780]   among families and clans.
[02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:52.580]   And we reach a turning point in human history
[02:23:52.580 --> 02:23:55.180]   with the invention of large-scale agriculture,
[02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:57.180]   which allows the creation of vast wealth.
[02:23:57.180 --> 02:24:00.460]   It allows the establishment of standing armies
[02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:01.580]   instead of militias.
[02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:04.540]   You know, Sargon of Akkad says,
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:07.780]   "I can pay 5,000 men to do nothing other
[02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:09.380]   "than to drill in the arts of war,
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.220]   "and then I'm gonna send them out
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:12.020]   "to conquer the neighboring city-states,
[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:13.780]   "and there you have empire."
[02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:18.260]   The Bible, which is the source of our image,
[02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:21.860]   our conception of a world of independent nations
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:24.740]   that are not constantly trying to conquer one another,
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:27.180]   the source of that is the Bible.
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:31.620]   And the biblical world is one in which
[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:38.100]   Israel and various other small nations
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:41.780]   are trying to fight for their independence
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:45.940]   against world empires, against empires, Babylonian,
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:47.460]   Assyrian, Persian, Egyptian,
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:49.660]   which aspire to rule the world.
[02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:54.900]   My claim is fundamentally twofold.
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:59.900]   It's moral that whenever you conquer a foreign nation,
[02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:03.620]   you're murdering and you're stealing, you're destroying.
[02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:06.180]   As your own would say, you're using force
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:10.220]   to cause people to submit.
[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:14.420]   So there is something in the prophets
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:19.100]   that rebels against this ongoing atrocity and carnage
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:21.100]   of trying to take over the whole world.
[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:26.380]   And there's a prudential, practical argument,
[02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:29.740]   which is that the world is governed best
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:31.620]   when there are multiple nations,
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:34.860]   when they're free to experiment and chart their own courses.
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:38.660]   That means they have their own route to God,
[02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:41.380]   they have their own moralities,
[02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:44.460]   they have their own forms of economy and government.
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.540]   And what tends to happen in history
[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:49.580]   is that when something is successful,
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:50.740]   when something looks like,
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:52.860]   when a different nation looks at it and say,
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:55.860]   wow, those people, they're flourishing, they're succeeding,
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:58.180]   then it's imitated.
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:01.940]   And in the way that the Dutch invented the stock market
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:04.860]   and the English said, look, that makes them powerful,
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:06.780]   so we'll adopt it.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:09.620]   So there's endless examples of that.
[02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:10.780]   So that's the argument for it.
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:15.780]   The argument is since we don't know a priori,
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:21.420]   deductively from self-evident principles, what is best,
[02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:22.980]   it's best to have a world
[02:26:22.980 --> 02:26:25.100]   in which people are trying different things.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:28.020]   - So quick question, because the word nationalism
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.660]   sometimes is presented in a negative light
[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:35.060]   in connection to the nationalism of Nazi Germany,
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:36.820]   for example. - Right, yeah.
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:41.820]   - So you're looking empirically at a world of nations
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:44.020]   that respect each other.
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:45.420]   - I use the word nationalism
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:48.540]   the way that I inherited it in my tradition,
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:50.980]   which is it's a principled standpoint
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:53.620]   that says that the world is governed best
[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:57.780]   when many nations are able to be independent
[02:26:57.780 --> 02:26:58.780]   and chart their own course.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:26:59.620]   That's nationalism.
[02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:02.660]   As far as the Nazis, Hitler's an imperialist.
[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:04.180]   He hated nation states.
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:06.340]   His whole theory, if you pick up,
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:08.940]   I don't recommend doing this, but if you do--
[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:10.460]   - Actually reading it right now, "Mein Kampf."
[02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:11.940]   - Right, if you do read "Mein Kampf,"
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:14.180]   then you'll see that he says explicitly
[02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:19.020]   that the goal is for Germany to be the lord of the earth
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:20.580]   and mistress of the globe,
[02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:24.460]   and he detests the idea of the independent nation state
[02:27:24.460 --> 02:27:27.100]   because he sees it as weak and effete.
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:28.540]   He might as well have said it's Jewish.
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:32.180]   So let me ask from the individual perspective,
[02:27:32.180 --> 02:27:35.540]   for nationalism, what do you make of the value
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:37.340]   of the love of country?
[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:43.060]   The reason I connect that, so I personally,
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.700]   what would you say, a patriot?
[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:49.740]   I love the love of country, or I am,
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:54.740]   or how should, in a Randian way, I enjoy, I--
[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:58.220]   - Love is good, love is a good word.
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:27:59.420]   Don't run away from it.
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:01.260]   - Well, I love a lot of things, but I'm saying
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:04.060]   this particular love is a little bit contentious,
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:06.460]   which is loving your country.
[02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:08.700]   That's an interesting love that some people
[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:10.300]   are a little uncomfortable with,
[02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:14.740]   especially when that love, I grew up in the Soviet Union,
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:18.100]   to say you just love the country.
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:20.100]   It represents a certain thing to you,
[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:21.900]   and you don't think philosophically,
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:25.980]   like I was marching around with marks under my arm
[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:26.820]   or something like that.
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:31.820]   It's just loving community at the level of nation.
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:34.060]   It's very interesting.
[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:36.700]   I don't know if that's an artifact of the past
[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:39.460]   that we're going to have to strip away.
[02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:42.420]   I don't know if I was just raised in that kind of community,
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:43.520]   but I appreciate that.
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:49.580]   I guess the thing I'm torn about is that love of country
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:52.660]   that I have in my heart, that I now love America,
[02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:55.100]   and I consider myself an American,
[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:58.260]   that would have easily, if I was born earlier,
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:01.860]   been used by Stalin, and I would have proudly died
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:03.220]   on the battlefield.
[02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:06.280]   I would have proudly died if I was in Nazi Germany
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:09.900]   as a German, and I would proudly die as an American.
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:11.060]   - Are you sure about these things?
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.340]   - Yes.
[02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:13.260]   - That's interesting.
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:14.660]   - No, I think about this a lot.
[02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:17.620]   - It's interesting to run a radical counterfactual
[02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:18.860]   and be sure of the answer.
[02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:21.860]   - I'm not sure, but I think about this a lot,
[02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:24.820]   because obviously I'm really interested in history,
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:28.860]   and this is the way I think about most situations,
[02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:31.760]   is I empathize, I really try to do hard work
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:35.220]   of placing myself in that moment and thinking through it.
[02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:38.020]   I'm just, okay, I just know myself psychologically.
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:42.420]   What I'm susceptible to, that's a negative way
[02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:45.260]   to phrase it, but what I would love doing.
[02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:48.300]   And so I'm just saying, my question is,
[02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:54.340]   is the love of nation a useful or a powerful moment
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:58.500]   or a powerful moral, sort of from a moral philosophy
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:01.140]   perspective, a good thing?
[02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:03.020]   - I think it is a good thing, but before we ask
[02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:05.580]   whether it's a good thing, I think it's worth asking
[02:30:05.580 --> 02:30:07.860]   whether there's any way to live without it.
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:11.580]   The idea of national independence, of a world
[02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:14.360]   or a continent which politically is governed
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:17.180]   by multiple independent national states,
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.060]   that is a political theory.
[02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:20.820]   Somebody came up with that.
[02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:25.100]   In the Bible or elsewhere, someone came up with this idea
[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:27.300]   and sold it and a lot of people like it.
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:31.540]   But the nation is not an invention.
[02:30:31.540 --> 02:30:36.180]   Every place in human history that we have any record of,
[02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:37.540]   there are nations.
[02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:42.540]   And so the fact of people creating families,
[02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:50.140]   families creating an alliance of clans,
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:52.500]   clans creating alliances of tribes,
[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:54.720]   tribes creating alliances of,
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:58.780]   an alliance that becomes the nation,
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:01.420]   we see that everywhere in human history,
[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:03.140]   everywhere we look.
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:08.060]   And the love of a group of tribes that have come together
[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:11.100]   in order to fight opponents that are trying to destroy
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:14.780]   your way of life and steal your land
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:17.660]   and harm your women and children,
[02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:23.820]   the love of the leadership that brings it together.
[02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:28.680]   Here, this is a George Washington-type figure
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:30.700]   or an Alfred the Great-type figure
[02:31:30.700 --> 02:31:33.620]   or Saul, the biblical Saul,
[02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:36.940]   somebody who has the wisdom, the daring
[02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:39.940]   to unite the tribes, overcome their internal
[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:47.100]   mutual hatreds and grievances and rally them around
[02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:49.720]   a set of ideas, a language, a tradition,
[02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:53.640]   an identity, as people say today.
[02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:57.080]   That love is eradicable from human beings.
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:58.500]   Maybe we'll have brave new world people
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:00.060]   who'll take drugs in order to get rid of it.
[02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:01.980]   - The problem is that could be leveraged
[02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:03.420]   by authoritarian regimes.
[02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:05.140]   - Yes, but that's true of everything.
[02:32:05.140 --> 02:32:07.220]   It's like saying, you can have children
[02:32:07.220 --> 02:32:08.380]   and you can teach them to be evil.
[02:32:08.380 --> 02:32:11.140]   You can make a lot of money and can use it for evil.
[02:32:11.140 --> 02:32:12.880]   You can have a gun for self-defense,
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:14.240]   but you can use it for evil.
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:17.020]   Come on, that's human, that's being human.
[02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:19.460]   - But you guys are making love this primary,
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:20.740]   which I don't think it is.
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:21.580]   There are lots of people--
[02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:22.460]   - How dare you, Yaron.
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:24.260]   - I know, there are lots of people in the world out there
[02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:25.460]   who don't love their nation
[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:27.440]   because their nation is not worth loving.
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:29.040]   That is, love is conditional.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.340]   It's not unconditional.
[02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:33.980]   Love is conditioned on the value that's presented to you.
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:37.780]   So I lived through this experience in my own life.
[02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:42.780]   I grew up in Israel at a time of everything
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:47.100]   was geared towards patriotism and the state.
[02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:51.220]   I would say I was trained to,
[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:52.820]   when I saw a grenade to jump on it,
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:57.100]   because that was, you know, every song and every story
[02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:01.460]   and everything was about the state is everything
[02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:02.300]   and you should sacrifice.
[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:05.980]   And you know, when the flag went up, I got teary-eyed.
[02:33:05.980 --> 02:33:08.640]   I mean, I bought into it completely.
[02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:11.900]   And at some point I rejected that.
[02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:14.060]   And I changed and I changed my alliance
[02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:16.260]   and I rejected my love of Israel.
[02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:17.540]   It's not that I don't love it anymore,
[02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:19.260]   but it's certainly not my top love.
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:20.740]   And it's certainly, I'm certainly not looking
[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:21.820]   for the grenade to jump on
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:24.620]   and I'm not volunteering to go fight the war there.
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:29.620]   And I fell in love from a distance with the idea of America.
[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:33.500]   I love the idea of America more than I love America.
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:35.220]   And I could see myself falling in love,
[02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:37.780]   out of love with America, given where it's heading.
[02:33:37.780 --> 02:33:39.100]   It's not automatic.
[02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:42.580]   It's conditioned on what it is that it represent
[02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:47.100]   and what it is, what value it represents for me.
[02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:50.420]   You know, and I think that's always the case with love.
[02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:52.300]   You know, it's not true
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:54.580]   that children have to love their parents.
[02:33:54.580 --> 02:33:56.580]   That's the ideal.
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:33:58.660]   And hopefully most children love their parents
[02:33:58.660 --> 02:34:01.020]   'cause their parents, but some children fall out of love
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:02.500]   with their parents because their parents
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:04.580]   don't deserve their love.
[02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:06.980]   And the same with the other way around.
[02:34:06.980 --> 02:34:09.940]   I think parents are capable of not loving their children.
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:12.620]   So love is a conditional thing.
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:13.460]   It's not automatic.
[02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:16.140]   But let me point out an agreement with,
[02:34:16.140 --> 02:34:17.340]   let me say something about an agreement with you all.
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:19.300]   - You're trying to bribe me with an agreement.
[02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:21.180]   - Okay, to soften the blow.
[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:22.380]   - To soften the blow, right?
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.940]   Mostly I like to talk to your own about his ideas
[02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:26.460]   and I don't want to talk about Ayn Rand,
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:27.820]   but I want to say something.
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:31.260]   Just one thing about Ayn Rand.
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:34.740]   All my kids read Ayn Rand's books.
[02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:36.300]   My father read "The Fountainhead."
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:40.420]   I don't know, like, you know, we know Ayn Rand.
[02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:45.420]   And I'll tell you, it is incredibly difficult
[02:34:45.420 --> 02:34:46.900]   reading for me.
[02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:49.700]   It's painful, it's painful to read.
[02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:51.180]   Why is it painful?
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:56.180]   Not because I disagree with the view of trading and business
[02:34:56.180 --> 02:35:00.940]   and the creativity of it and, you know, and Reardon Metal.
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:04.340]   I mean, you know, that stuff moves me.
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:07.780]   And I do admire it.
[02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:12.340]   But to read, you know, a book that's a thousand pages long
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:16.620]   in which nobody, nobody is having children.
[02:35:16.620 --> 02:35:19.100]   Nobody is having a stable marriage.
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:23.540]   No one is running an admirable government
[02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:25.220]   that's fighting for a just cause.
[02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:29.260]   Anywhere, anywhere, you're on, I feel, I just,
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:34.180]   I feel like, like, it's focusing on one aspect
[02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:36.780]   of what it is to be human and to flourish.
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:40.340]   And that everything else is just erased and thrown out
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:42.020]   as though it's just not part of reality.
[02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:46.220]   And I'm scared, I'm scared of what happens to teenagers
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:48.580]   who hormonally are in any case,
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:53.580]   no, that's, they're programmed to pull away from their parents
[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:54.700]   and experiment with things.
[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:58.540]   They're biologically programmed to do that.
[02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:00.980]   And you give them a book which says,
[02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:04.180]   look, you don't have to have a family.
[02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:05.380]   You don't have to raise children.
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:06.540]   You don't have to have a country.
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.020]   You don't have to fight for anything.
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:12.380]   All you have to do is assert yourself in trade.
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:16.140]   I think it's destructive because it's not realistic.
[02:36:16.140 --> 02:36:17.460]   It's just not real.
[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:19.620]   - But I got none of that from Ayn Rand.
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:21.020]   I got none of that from Ayn Rand.
[02:36:21.020 --> 02:36:24.820]   You know, the books were not about a family.
[02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:27.660]   You could write a book in Ayn Rand style
[02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:30.220]   about where people have a family,
[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:33.380]   but the goal, the purpose, it's a novel.
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:35.980]   It's not, it's a novel which is delimited
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:37.380]   with a particular story.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:39.220]   There's one family in "Galt's Gulch"
[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:41.700]   and there's a little passage about raising children
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:44.900]   and the value of that because it's not core
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:49.100]   to what she is writing about, but that doesn't exclude it.
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:51.460]   When I read Ayn Rand, I read "Atlas Shrugged" when I was 16
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:54.900]   and I read it over the years several times more.
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.260]   It never occurred to me, oh, Ayn Rand's anti-family.
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:36:58.900]   I shouldn't have a family.
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:00.980]   That thought never came into my mind.
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:02.620]   I always wanted to have children.
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:04.780]   I continue to want to have children.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:06.780]   I thought of it a little differently.
[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:08.420]   I thought of how I would find a partner
[02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:09.380]   a little bit differently.
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:12.620]   I thought about what I would look for in a partner
[02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:15.860]   differently, but not that I wouldn't want to get married.
[02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:19.340]   - One question I have is what effect it has on society,
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:20.900]   so outside of you.
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:23.140]   So for example, you mentioned love should be conditional.
[02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:23.980]   I think-- - Well, it is.
[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:25.620]   Whether you like it or not, it is.
[02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:26.980]   You might pretend that it isn't,
[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:27.900]   but it's always conditional.
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:29.300]   - Well, let me try to say something
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.340]   and see if it makes any sense.
[02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:35.240]   So could there be things that are true,
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:38.260]   like love is conditional, is always conditional,
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:41.140]   that if you say it often,
[02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:43.120]   it has a negative effect on society?
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:47.900]   So for example, I mean, so maybe I'm just a romantic,
[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:50.100]   but good luck saying love is conditional
[02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:52.220]   to a romantic partner.
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:56.120]   I mean, you could, I would argue, en masse,
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:59.940]   that would deteriorate the quality of relationships
[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:06.140]   if you remind the partner of that truth that is universal.
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:11.220]   Like you have to, I mean, okay, maybe it's just me.
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:12.420]   I'll just speak to myself.
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:14.540]   It's like there is a certain romantic notion
[02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:15.880]   of unconditional love.
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:19.900]   - It's part of why you have so many destructive marriages.
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:21.420]   It's part of why-- - So you would say
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:22.260]   that's a problem.
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:23.940]   - Yes, it's a real problem,
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:27.380]   because yes, there is,
[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:29.620]   you all talked about honoring your spouse,
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:32.860]   and there's a real truth there, and I respect that.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:35.260]   Yes, you have to do certain things.
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:37.140]   Love is not, you marry somebody,
[02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:39.200]   and there's a real attitude out there in the culture.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.180]   You marry somebody, and okay, now we're gonna,
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:42.460]   we're just gonna cruise.
[02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:44.060]   It's just-- - Right, Hollywood.
[02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:44.900]   That's the Hollywood marriage.
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:46.420]   - You know, marriage is work.
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:49.540]   Like all values, it's work.
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:51.700]   It's something you have to reignite every day.
[02:38:51.700 --> 02:38:53.440]   You have to, there are challenges.
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:55.340]   There are real disagreements.
[02:38:55.340 --> 02:39:00.140]   There are things you fight about, you disagree about,
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:03.500]   and there's real, if it's a value, you work it out.
[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:05.700]   You struggle through it,
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.580]   and sometimes you struggle through it,
[02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:09.820]   and you come to a conclusion,
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.740]   nah, this is not gonna work,
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:13.020]   and you dissolve a marriage,
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:16.100]   and I'm all for dissolving after really,
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:16.980]   really fighting for it,
[02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.540]   because if it's an important value,
[02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:21.440]   and if you fell in love with this person for a reason,
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:23.460]   then that's something worth fighting for.
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:25.340]   I have a feeling that Hollywood goes the other way,
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:29.160]   but it's not this cruising along, and everything's easy.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:30.620]   No human relationship is like that.
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:34.340]   Not friendship, not love, not raising children,
[02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:35.600]   not being a child.
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.780]   They require work, and they require thinking,
[02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:43.940]   and they require creating the conditions to thrive,
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:46.140]   and that's the sense in which it's conditional.
[02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:48.220]   You have to work at it,
[02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:53.220]   and it's very easy not to do the work,
[02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:55.940]   and it's very easy to drift away,
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:57.320]   and I think most people don't do the work.
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:59.960]   Most people take it, and generally in life.
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:03.520]   The only place people seem to work is at work,
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:05.200]   and then they take the rest of their life
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:06.600]   as I'm gonna cruise,
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:08.640]   and yet every aspect of your life,
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:11.560]   the art you choose, the friends you choose,
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:13.240]   the lovers you choose,
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:16.940]   all require real thinking and real work
[02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.280]   to be successful at them.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:21.680]   None of them are just there,
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:24.360]   because there is no such thing as just the intrinsic.
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:25.960]   - Right, I agree with all of that.
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:27.760]   I was gonna say before that the rabbis
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:31.360]   have this sort of shocking expression,
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:33.420]   tzal gidul banim,
[02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:38.420]   the pain of raising children,
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:43.200]   and I find when I speak to audiences about relationships,
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.660]   I find that in general,
[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:47.760]   and this is cross-cultural,
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:50.560]   it's different countries, different religious backgrounds,
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:54.800]   that in general, young people do not know
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:57.420]   that the only way to make a marriage work
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:00.640]   is through a lot of pain and overcoming.
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:03.540]   They don't know that raising children
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:05.060]   involves a great deal of pain.
[02:41:05.060 --> 02:41:09.620]   They don't know that caring for and helping your parents
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:11.400]   approach the end of their lives
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.280]   causes a great deal of pain,
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:16.900]   and everything is kind of this sketchy,
[02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:18.700]   very sketchy, glimpsy kind of,
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:20.500]   and I mention Hollywood just because
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.000]   everything is made to look easy,
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.300]   except there's kind of a funny breakdown of something,
[02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:29.060]   but then maybe there's a divorce,
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:29.900]   they shoot one another,
[02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:31.660]   so then they should get divorced,
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:36.660]   but the reality of how hard it is to do
[02:41:36.660 --> 02:41:42.980]   and how heroic it is to do it and then overcome
[02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:45.920]   and then actually in the end achieve something,
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:47.100]   create something,
[02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:52.260]   it's almost not discussed,
[02:41:52.260 --> 02:41:55.260]   and so to me, it's just not surprising
[02:41:55.260 --> 02:41:59.600]   that if there's no parallel to Ayn Rand
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.300]   about the heroic saving of a marriage
[02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:04.140]   that was on the rocks,
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:05.380]   how does it actually happen?
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:09.700]   - It's a good point you're making,
[02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:11.660]   but it's something that just came to me
[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:12.740]   that I've never thought of before,
[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:13.980]   so that's always good.
[02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:16.420]   This is where conversation is good.
[02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:19.220]   Look, take the Talmud,
[02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:22.220]   I can't remember how many years after the Bible,
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:23.420]   the Talmud is written,
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:25.900]   how many over how long of a period it's written,
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:28.420]   how many people participating in writing it.
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:30.360]   Ayn Rand was one individual.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:32.060]   She wrote a series of books on philosophy,
[02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:34.820]   which I think are true,
[02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:36.460]   but they're the beginning.
[02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:39.900]   There is a lot of work to be done to apply this,
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:42.980]   so hopefully there will be one of her students
[02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:45.420]   who writes a book on relationships,
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:47.860]   and there'll be somebody who writes a book
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:50.780]   on developing a political theory in greater detail,
[02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:52.300]   and develop her ethics.
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:55.220]   She's got a few writings on ethics,
[02:42:55.220 --> 02:42:56.200]   and it's in the novels,
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:58.420]   but there's a lot of work to be done,
[02:42:58.420 --> 02:42:59.260]   fleshing it out,
[02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:00.740]   what does it mean, how do you,
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:04.780]   so to say Ayn Rand didn't do everything is a truism.
[02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:06.420]   She didn't do everything.
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:07.260]   Okay, so what?
[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:10.060]   But she laid this amazing philosophical foundation
[02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:12.900]   that allows us to take those principles
[02:43:12.900 --> 02:43:16.060]   and to apply them to all these realms of human life,
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.780]   and she does it on a scope
[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:19.580]   that few philosophers in human history have done,
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:22.620]   'cause she goes from metaphysics all the way to aesthetics,
[02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:23.460]   hitting the key,
[02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:26.620]   and she's an original thinker on each one of those things,
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:28.260]   and she might be right,
[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:30.980]   she might be wrong on certain aspects of it,
[02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:32.220]   always happy to have a debate
[02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:34.760]   about where she's wrong or where she's not,
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:37.060]   but there's a lot of work to be done, right?
[02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:38.060]   It's not like,
[02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:40.260]   and if there were objectivists out there
[02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:41.700]   who presented as,
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:43.140]   okay, human knowledge is over
[02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:44.320]   'cause Ayn Rand wrote these books,
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:45.620]   that's absurd, right?
[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:48.180]   There's huge amount of work to be done
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:50.020]   in applying these particular ideas
[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:52.340]   just like there was for any philosophy,
[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:53.900]   take these ideas and now apply them
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:56.460]   to all these realms in human experience
[02:43:56.460 --> 02:43:58.340]   that flesh it out and make it,
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:43:59.340]   and one of the reasons
[02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:01.480]   I don't think objectivism has taken off
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:03.820]   is because there's all this work still to be done
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:06.900]   that allows it to be relatable to people
[02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:08.260]   in every aspect of it.
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:10.140]   - Let me ask a hard question here.
[02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:10.980]   We've taken--
[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:12.820]   - Can I say what I agreed with you, Omar?
[02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:13.860]   - Sure, sure, please.
[02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:16.060]   This is good, it's a bigger transition.
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:17.500]   - Here, this is the clip.
[02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:19.500]   This is the clip.
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:20.700]   - I agree about nations,
[02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:23.040]   so I don't like the term nationalism
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:25.100]   because I fear what happens
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:27.740]   when you put an -ism at the end of any word.
[02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:28.620]   - Anything, yes.
[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:31.940]   - But the nation is a good thing,
[02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:34.300]   and having a diversity of nations,
[02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:35.580]   in a sense, is a good thing,
[02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:38.860]   and in a sense, I don't think one can come up,
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:42.020]   so look, I said, I hold,
[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:44.260]   that the ideal nation is a nation
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:46.660]   that protects individual rights.
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.300]   How do you do that?
[02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:49.340]   What are the details?
[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:50.580]   How do we define property rights
[02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:52.780]   exactly in an internet world?
[02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:54.060]   There's gonna be disagreement,
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:56.540]   rational, reasonable disagreement.
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:44:59.740]   There're gonna be, in my future,
[02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:00.940]   in the 300 years from now,
[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:03.180]   when my ideas have won finally,
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:04.540]   there will be multiple nations
[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:06.060]   trying to apply the principle
[02:45:06.060 --> 02:45:07.300]   of applying individual rights,
[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:08.780]   and they'll do it differently.
[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:11.740]   One of the benefits of federalism
[02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:13.800]   is that while you have a national government,
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:16.020]   there are certain issues that you relegate to states,
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:18.820]   and they can try different things and learn
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:21.340]   because there is a huge value
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:23.180]   in the empirical knowledge comes there.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:26.060]   You can't just deduce it all and figure it all out.
[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:27.380]   You have to experiment,
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:30.580]   so I do, I hate the idea of a one-world nation.
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:34.260]   One-world government because experimentation is gone,
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:37.300]   and if you make a mistake, everybody suffers.
[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:39.220]   I like the idea, and then I like the idea
[02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:42.980]   of people being able to choose where they live,
[02:45:42.980 --> 02:45:47.060]   but this notion of experimentation, I think, is crucial,
[02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:48.740]   but you need a principle.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.340]   This is, you need a principle,
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:51.820]   so I don't like the idea of nations
[02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:54.860]   if all the nations are gonna be bad, right?
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:56.860]   If all the nations are gonna be horrible,
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:45:57.980]   then I don't like it.
[02:45:57.980 --> 02:46:00.220]   What I like is a variety of nations,
[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:03.860]   all practicing basically good ideas,
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:05.140]   and then we try to figure out,
[02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:06.900]   okay, what works better than other things,
[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:09.660]   and what is sustainable and what is not.
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:13.980]   - Given how many difficult aspects of history
[02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:15.300]   and society we've talked about,
[02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:17.400]   let me ask a hard question of both of you.
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:19.620]   - Breeze up until now.
[02:46:19.620 --> 02:46:21.740]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:25.260]   What gives you hope about the future?
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:28.860]   So we've been describing reasons
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:31.460]   to maybe not have hope.
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:32.940]   What gives you hope?
[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:35.220]   When you look at the world,
[02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:37.420]   what gives you hope that in 200 years,
[02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:39.180]   and 300 years, and 500 years,
[02:46:39.180 --> 02:46:41.660]   like the founders look into the future,
[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:45.360]   that human civilization will be all right,
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:47.700]   and more than that, it will flourish?
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:49.500]   - Two things for me.
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:50.660]   One is history.
[02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:53.700]   So in the very long run, good ideas win out.
[02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:56.380]   I think in the very long run,
[02:46:56.380 --> 02:46:57.980]   you can go through a dark ages,
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:46:59.580]   but you come out of a dark ages.
[02:46:59.580 --> 02:47:06.060]   You know, the good and the just does win in the end,
[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:09.840]   even if it is bloody, and difficult, and hard to get there.
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:12.220]   So while I am quite pessimistic, unfortunately,
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:14.900]   about the short run, I'm ultimately optimistic
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:17.660]   that in the long run, good ideas win,
[02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:18.940]   and they're justified.
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:23.140]   And I think the fundamental behind that is,
[02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:26.780]   I think is that I'm fundamentally positive
[02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:27.900]   about human nature.
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:31.820]   I think human beings can think,
[02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:33.820]   they're capable of reasoning,
[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:36.420]   they're capable of figuring out the truth,
[02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:38.540]   they're capable of learning from experience.
[02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:39.940]   They don't always do it.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:43.820]   It's an achievement to do it, but over time, they do.
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.100]   And if you create the right circumstances, they will.
[02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:51.980]   And when things get bad enough, they look for a way out.
[02:47:51.980 --> 02:47:54.140]   They look at maybe at history,
[02:47:54.140 --> 02:47:55.540]   if the history is available to them,
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:48:00.540]   maybe at just learning from what's around them
[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:03.140]   to find better ways of doing things,
[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:04.940]   and that reinforces itself.
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:09.860]   But human beings are an amazing creature.
[02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:12.660]   We're just amazing in our capacity to be creative,
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:15.260]   in our capacity to think, in our capacity to love,
[02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:17.220]   in our capacity to change our environment,
[02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:20.360]   to fit our needs, and to fit our requirements for survival,
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:23.540]   and to learn, and to grow, and to progress.
[02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:28.540]   And so again, long-term, I think all that wins out.
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:32.320]   Short-term, in any point in history, short-term,
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:36.500]   it doesn't, right now, it doesn't look too good.
[02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:39.620]   - What about you, Jaron?
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:44.060]   - Well, as usual, I'm moved by what Jaron says,
[02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:47.220]   and I hear scripture.
[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:51.980]   And the source for Jaron's hope
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:56.900]   is the book of Exodus,
[02:48:56.900 --> 02:48:59.660]   which is the first place in human history
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:03.780]   where we are presented with the possibility
[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:07.340]   that an enslaved people that's being persecuted,
[02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:10.820]   and murdered, and living under the worst possible regime
[02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:14.460]   can free itself and have a shot
[02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:16.900]   at a life of independence and worth.
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:20.300]   And it's another inherited Jewish ideal
[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:22.520]   in the tradition.
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:27.100]   The way that we express this is by saying
[02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:30.140]   that there is a God who judges.
[02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:36.300]   The Israelites in Egypt were enslaved for hundreds of years,
[02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:38.060]   according to the Exodus story,
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:42.180]   hundreds of years before God wakes up and hears them.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:47.180]   And He doesn't do anything until Moses kills the oppressor
[02:49:47.180 --> 02:49:49.660]   and goes out into the desert.
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:53.820]   So I think it's pretty realistic
[02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:57.620]   that there is a God, that God judges and acts,
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:02.260]   but probably often not for a very, very long time
[02:50:02.260 --> 02:50:04.380]   and not until there's a human being
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:06.820]   who gets up and says enough.
[02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:09.300]   I know that today people don't wanna read the Bible.
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:11.120]   They don't like reading the Bible.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:16.120]   But I always hear in my ear this cry of the prophet Jeremiah
[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:22.460]   who saw his nation destroyed and his people exiled.
[02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:28.380]   And he says, in God's name, he says,
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:32.380]   "Is not my word like fire,
[02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:34.620]   "like the hammer that shatters rock?"
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:36.980]   Apetitim et petzela.
[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:39.260]   The hammer, my word is like fire,
[02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:41.740]   like the hammer that shatters rock.
[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:44.220]   And this is actually, this is the traditional way
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:46.060]   of saying something like what Joran is saying,
[02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:48.780]   that it may take a long, long time,
[02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:52.940]   but there is a truth and it has its own strength
[02:50:52.940 --> 02:50:55.620]   and it will, in the end,
[02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:58.500]   shatter the things that are opposing it.
[02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:00.580]   That's our traditional hope.
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:02.980]   We grow up like that.
[02:51:02.980 --> 02:51:07.580]   And so I do have hope.
[02:51:07.580 --> 02:51:08.720]   I see the trends.
[02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:10.460]   The trends are terrible right now.
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:14.740]   And it's frightening and it's hard.
[02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:17.180]   But we are terrible at seeing the future.
[02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:21.580]   And it is very possible that an unexpected turn of events
[02:51:21.580 --> 02:51:26.300]   is going to appear maybe soon, maybe much later.
[02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:31.300]   And the possibility of a redemption is there.
[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:36.020]   - Let me ask, given that long arc of history,
[02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:38.120]   given that you do study the Bible,
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:42.620]   what is the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:44.060]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:46.340]   - Wow, that's beautiful.
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:49.220]   I think that the meaning of life is,
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:54.100]   is in part what Joran touches on
[02:51:54.100 --> 02:51:59.100]   when he says that productive work, labor, creativity,
[02:51:59.100 --> 02:52:02.860]   is at the heart of what it is to be human.
[02:52:02.860 --> 02:52:07.900]   I just think that there are some more arenas,
[02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:10.060]   and maybe we even agree with a lot of them,
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:12.380]   and on a lot of them.
[02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:17.380]   To be human is to inherit a world which is imperfect,
[02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:21.980]   terribly imperfect, imperfect in many ways.
[02:52:21.980 --> 02:52:26.860]   And God created it that way.
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:30.620]   He created a world which is terribly lacking.
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:34.740]   And he created us with the ability to stand up
[02:52:34.740 --> 02:52:38.620]   and to say, I can change the direction of this.
[02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:40.980]   I can do something to change the direction of this.
[02:52:40.980 --> 02:52:43.540]   I can take the time and the abilities
[02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:46.060]   that are given to me to be a partner with God
[02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:47.300]   in creating the world.
[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:50.540]   It's not gonna stay the way it was before me.
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:52.900]   It'll be something different.
[02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:56.300]   Maybe a little bit, maybe a lot.
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:52:59.940]   But that is the heart, that is the key,
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:02.060]   that is the meaningful life,
[02:53:02.060 --> 02:53:05.460]   is to be a partner with God in creating the world
[02:53:05.460 --> 02:53:10.220]   so that it is moving that much more in the right direction
[02:53:10.220 --> 02:53:12.100]   rather than the way we found it.
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:14.300]   - So nudge, even if a little bit,
[02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:16.460]   the direction of the world.
[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:21.180]   Well, you've actually been talking
[02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:23.180]   in your program about life quite a bit.
[02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:26.740]   So let me ask the same question.
[02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:29.340]   And I never tire of you asking this question.
[02:53:29.340 --> 02:53:31.580]   (laughing)
[02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:34.660]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:53:34.660 --> 02:53:36.380]   - Well, I mean, I don't believe in God,
[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:41.380]   so God doesn't play a role in my view of the meaning of life.
[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:44.620]   I think the meaning of life is to live.
[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:46.860]   I like to say to live with a capital L.
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:52.700]   It's to embrace it, and I agree with you on this sense.
[02:53:52.700 --> 02:53:55.940]   We're born into a world, and as human beings,
[02:53:55.940 --> 02:53:58.100]   one of the things that makes us very different
[02:53:58.100 --> 02:54:01.220]   than other animals is our capacity to change that world.
[02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:02.500]   We can actually go out there
[02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:04.060]   and change the world around us.
[02:54:04.060 --> 02:54:07.180]   We can change it materially through production,
[02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:09.780]   and we can change it spiritually
[02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:11.900]   through changing the ideas of people.
[02:54:11.900 --> 02:54:15.740]   We can change the direction to which humanity works.
[02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:19.020]   We can create a little universe.
[02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:21.900]   I think part of the joy of creating a family
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:23.740]   is to create a little universe, right?
[02:54:23.740 --> 02:54:26.540]   We're creating a little world around us.
[02:54:26.540 --> 02:54:28.940]   That's part of the joy.
[02:54:28.940 --> 02:54:30.060]   And there is joy in family.
[02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:32.700]   It's not make it all about difficulty and hard work.
[02:54:32.700 --> 02:54:33.940]   - I agree, I agree.
[02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:36.900]   - You know, part of the idea of getting married
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:40.100]   is to create a little world in which you and your spouse
[02:54:40.100 --> 02:54:42.900]   are creating something that didn't exist before
[02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:46.020]   and building something, building a universe.
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:46.940]   But it's really to live.
[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:49.620]   I mean, one of the things that I see
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:52.940]   and that saddens me is wasted lives,
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:55.780]   is people who just cruise through life.
[02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:59.500]   They get born in a particular place.
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:00.420]   They never challenge it.
[02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:01.780]   They never question.
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:04.420]   They just, you know, they live, die,
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:05.700]   and nothing really happened.
[02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:06.620]   Nothing really changed.
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:07.460]   They didn't produce.
[02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:09.060]   They didn't make anything of their life
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:12.620]   and produce here, again, in the largest sense.
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:15.260]   So to me, it's, and every aspect of life,
[02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:17.140]   you know, as you know, 'cause you've listened to my show,
[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:18.820]   I love art, I love aesthetics.
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:21.460]   I love the experience of great art.
[02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:23.620]   You know, I love relationships.
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:26.420]   I, you know, I love producing.
[02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:28.100]   You know, I like business.
[02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:29.940]   I like that, that aspect of it.
[02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:34.220]   And I think people are shallow
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:37.180]   in so many parts of their lives, which saddens me.
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:41.300]   I mean, if we, if you had 8 billion people in this planet,
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:43.980]   even if it never grew, even if we just stated 8 billion,
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:47.100]   but the 8 billion all lived fully.
[02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:50.740]   Wow, I mean, what an amazing place this would be.
[02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.540]   What an amazing experience we would have.
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:55.820]   So to me, that is, the meaning is just make the most,
[02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:58.540]   that you have a short period of time on Earth.
[02:55:58.540 --> 02:55:59.460]   And that's it.
[02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:02.340]   This is it, and live it, experience it fully,
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:04.660]   and challenge yourself and push yourself.
[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:07.700]   And let me just say something about optimism.
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:10.100]   You know, one source of hope for me
[02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:12.420]   in the world in which we live right now
[02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:14.140]   is that there are people who do that,
[02:56:14.140 --> 02:56:17.700]   at least in certain realms of their lives, right?
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:21.420]   And I'm inspired, and I know a lot of people
[02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:23.660]   don't like me for this, but I'm inspired, for example,
[02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:25.060]   by Silicon Valley, in spite of all
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:26.900]   the political disagreements I have with them
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:29.580]   and all of that, I'm inspired by people
[02:56:29.580 --> 02:56:31.380]   inventing new technologies and building,
[02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:33.620]   I'm inspired by the people you talk to
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:36.980]   about artificial intelligence and about new ideas
[02:56:36.980 --> 02:56:39.180]   and about pushing the boundaries of science.
[02:56:39.180 --> 02:56:41.780]   Those things are exciting, and it's terrific
[02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:44.180]   to see a world that I think generally is in decline,
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:46.460]   yet there are these pockets in which people
[02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:50.420]   are still creating new ventures and new ideas
[02:56:50.420 --> 02:56:53.800]   and new things, that inspires me and it gives me hope
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:56.700]   that that is not dead, that in spite of the decay
[02:56:56.700 --> 02:56:58.580]   that's in our culture, there's still pockets
[02:56:58.580 --> 02:57:03.460]   where that spirit of being human is still alive and well.
[02:57:03.460 --> 02:57:05.340]   - Yeah, they inspire me as well.
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:08.140]   Yeah, and they truly live with a capital L,
[02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:12.520]   and maybe I can do a star, maybe we can also put
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.140]   a little bit of love with a capital L out there as well.
[02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:20.860]   Yaron, you knew I would end it that way, wouldn't you?
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:23.820]   Yaron, Yaron, thank you so much, this is a huge honor.
[02:57:23.820 --> 02:57:25.420]   I really enjoyed the debate yesterday,
[02:57:25.420 --> 02:57:26.940]   I really enjoyed the conversation today
[02:57:26.940 --> 02:57:29.620]   that you will spend your valuable time with me,
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:33.280]   it just means a lot, thank you so much, this was amazing.
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:35.300]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:57:35.300 --> 02:57:37.780]   with Yaron Brook and Yaron Hozony.

[02:57:42.060 --> 02:57:46.300]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Edmund Burke.
[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:49.380]   The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil
[02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:51.700]   is for good men to do nothing.
[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:55.380]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you
[02:57:55.380 --> 02:57:56.220]   next time.

[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:01.380]   (upbeat music)
