[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   It is not a comfortable subject to talk about, but it is essential that we
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.120]   understand sin. How sin works, what it does to us, and how the gospel heals us
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.640]   from its damage. In his first message at the 2015 Pastors Conference, John Piper
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.040]   offered a brief survey of sin from the book of Romans, and we jump into that
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.080]   message in the following clip as John Piper addresses Romans chapter 1 verse
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   18. Here's what he said. Verse 18, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.600]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.920]   unrighteousness suppress the truth." So here mankind in general is described as
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.020]   ungodly and unrighteous. John, 1st John 5 17 says, "All unrighteousness is sin." So
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.280]   we know we're dealing with here. "To all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   who," what's the first thing they do? They suppress the truth. Our ungodliness and
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:25.100]   unrighteousness inclines us to suppress truth. We repel the light. We run into
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.180]   darkness. Jesus said in John 3 that we are guilty sinners, not because we're
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.940]   victims of darkness, but lovers of darkness. John 3 19, "Light has come into
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.340]   the world, and people loved darkness rather than light." So right off the bat,
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:55.020]   I'm getting the feeling, okay, deep down in me issues are love issues. I love the
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.020]   dark. I can suppress the truth so much more easily in the dark, and that's what
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:13.660]   sin does. It suppresses truth. What truth does it specialize in suppressing? Verse
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:24.660]   19, "Because what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.380]   it to them." Knowledge of God is the truth that sin wants to suppress. So he says,
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.380]   "Therefore we have no excuse." Verse 20, middle of the verse, "So they are without
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.660]   excuse." Verse 21, "Why? Because although they knew, they knew God, they did not
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:58.020]   glorify Him or give Him thanks." So the root of why we suppress the truth is
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:07.380]   that we don't want to glorify or thank God, and the truth is always testifying
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.940]   to His glory and His beneficence, and so it has to be squished down, put out of
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.020]   our mind, lest we feel guilty about not glorifying and thanking Him. We don't
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.860]   want to do it because we're sinners, and sin doesn't thank God. Sin doesn't
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.940]   glorify God. Sin loves darkness, which conceals the glory of God and the
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.380]   beneficence of God. Sin is not just a hater of the light and of the knowledge
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.580]   of God desiring to suppress it. Sin is a lover. When the hated truth is suppressed,
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.900]   the loved lie is embraced. Verse 22, "Claiming to be wise, they" — that is, those
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.900]   who suppress the truth — "have darkened hearts. Claiming to be wise, they have
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.860]   become fools, and they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images."
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:24.260]   They don't just bury truth, they embrace alternative lovers. There's no vacuum in
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.420]   the human heart, ever. When the real God is rejected, images are embraced. They
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:43.340]   exchanged the glory of God for images. Sin hates the true God, and sin loves
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.700]   God-substituting images. And we, more than any culture in the history of the world,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:01.140]   live in an age of images. We spend almost all our leisure time looking at images.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.900]   Quite irrelevant, I think, that for Paul those images were stone or wood along
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.380]   the side of an Athenian road, and ours are on our phone or television or
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.220]   computer. Irrelevant. The issue is substitution. They exchanged the infinitely
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:28.080]   valuable glory of God for the glory of that show of images coming off the
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.980]   screen. Yes, amen. This clip was taken from John Piper's message, "What is Sin? The
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.940]   Essence and Root of All Sinning," from the 2015 Pastors Conference. The full
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.060]   message is on our site, along with all the conference media and over 1,200
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.740]   other messages from John Piper. See our archive at DesiringGod.org. Tomorrow,
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.740]   Ray Ortlund will join us to talk about Bible reading, specifically, what are we
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.140]   doing when we read the Bible, and how does the Bible ground us and stabilize
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.140]   us. I'm your host Tony Rehnke. We'll see you tomorrow.
