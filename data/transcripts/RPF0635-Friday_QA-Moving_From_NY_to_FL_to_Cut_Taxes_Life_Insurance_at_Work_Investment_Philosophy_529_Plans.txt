[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:56.000]   So in general, the way that those programs work is they will provide some, a small amount of life insurance,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.700]   a token amount of life insurance coverage,
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.860]   and the monthly premiums that are required are not much.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.600]   They're only a few dollars usually.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.340]   The reason is just simply because there's not much insurance coverage.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:11.260]   $50,000 of term life insurance for almost any person is only a few dollars per month.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.000]   So I don't see any reason not to participate in those programs if they're available to you.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.140]   The great thing is they're guaranteed issue.

[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:18.380]   that's where his time and attention should be not on on perfecting his portfolio that man's best
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:18.380]   that's where his time and attention should be not on on perfecting his portfolio that man's best investment solution is to hire a highly
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:18.380]   that's where his time and attention should be not on on perfecting his portfolio that man's best investment solution is to hire a highly qualified team of financial advisors who are going to invest in an intelligent way and then with their advice and their input he should choose what portion of his money he wants an absolutely safe and secure investments and what portion of his money he wants in more speculative investments and he'll
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:48.400]   the point is his economic engine is not his investment allocation he might take a speculative jump and say I'm gonna buy an apartment building in in in Brazil or I'm going to buy a company in the Ukraine or something like that he might speculate on stuff but he would he should never be advised that that's his primary focus his primary focus is on his income now most of us are not either interested in or ever going to
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   Now most of us are not either interested in or ever going to

Sure. They're not ineffective, but are they the most effective? Well, all I can say is when I did that work and I did that business, one of the things I kind of came to realize was I couldn't point to many of my clients that I had actually helped to get rich. Rather, all of my wealthy clients seemed to have taken a commission.

[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   One was a real estate investment business.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   I encouraged him to start a media business.

[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   I don't know. I find that question difficult. I find it hard to argue against the arguments of the passively managed mutual funds.
