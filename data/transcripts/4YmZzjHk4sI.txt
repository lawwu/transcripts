[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   it's obviously virtuous or compelling or exciting to foster all these nascent startups and to kind
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.080]   of be an anti-incumbency force. But what's the case for supporting established businesses?
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.640]   I think people misunderstand where a small business typically, not in every case, but
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.040]   at least in the cases where we denote them startups, there's usually an embedded innovation
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.520]   and the innovation is kind of all that the company is. Like they have a new idea and they're going
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.960]   to do something better or different or, you know, whatever. And so, you know, generally speaking,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.080]   we like innovation. And so we've, you know, positive sentiments towards that startup.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.760]   But there's a lot of innovation that comes from large established businesses. That's not all they
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   do. You know, there's also just running the existing thing. And so maybe it's a smaller
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.360]   share, but the aggregate fraction of innovation that comes from established businesses is really
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.720]   large. And, you know, we have to be cognizant of the cognitive bias of the startups perhaps
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.960]   being somewhat more conspicuous. You choose any sector of the economy and a significant fraction
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.920]   of the important, you know, inventions that occurred over the last 10 or 20 years will have
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.160]   come from the incumbents. And so I think as a general class and, you know, Tyler, of course,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.720]   wrote a book on this, I think big business is underrated. I think it's true that established
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   businesses tend to pay better. They tend to be more efficient. More of the innovation in our
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.840]   economy comes from them and they produce a lot of consumer surplus. Maybe a lot of the tech industry
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880]   doesn't place a lot of value on process and operational excellence. You know, we kind of
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.320]   culturally value the spontaneous and the creative and the iconoclastic and the path breaking, but
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.480]   building mechanisms that can enable the very reliable provision of important services at scale
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.920]   and, you know, removing the sources of variability that can really cause a bad day for a very large
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.040]   number of people. I don't think they get quite as much cultural credit. I mean, if you think about
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.920]   just like the big trends in society that are needed to solve our big problems, right? Like
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.680]   Moore's law or the cost of solar or something, these are just, you have marginal improvements
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.240]   over many decades that the big tech or big companies are just able to invest a lot of money
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   into doing the R&D here. Relentless iterative improvement, yes, is underrated. When we think
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.120]   about the way in which Stripe will continue to grow in the future, in some sense it'll obviously
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.240]   involve a lot of big businesses and, you know, you're now processing a significant amount of
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.080]   Amazon volume versus other businesses you're doing deals with. First, tell me how you think,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.440]   it kind of makes sense how an exponentially growing startup would contribute to exponentially
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.960]   growing growth for a Stripe. How does like, does Stripe keep growing in the same trajectory when
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.760]   it's these existing big businesses that you're partnering with? You know, Stripe is doomed to
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   eventually grow at the rate of the economy. There is just a question of, you know,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.480]   how long it takes to get that right.
