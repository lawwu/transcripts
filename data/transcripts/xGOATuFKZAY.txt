[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820]   Despite my worry about prices during the Olympics,
[00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.200]   there were actually a ton of options.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.840]   And when I was doing research,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.300]   I read that similar thing happened in London as well
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.580]   for the Olympics there.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.980]   And I think there's a window where it's far enough out
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.700]   that no one knows how crowded it's gonna be
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.480]   and prices are really expensive.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.220]   But actually as you get closer,
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.540]   they seem to come down a bit.
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.800]   So first off, if you're ever booking some big event,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.900]   I'd encourage everyone to make
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.520]   a refundable reservation early so you have it
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.200]   just in case things are expensive.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.040]   And so we looked at a lot of things.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.540]   This is where the hotel search tools
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.800]   also really, really shine,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040]   'cause we knew exactly where we wanted to go.
