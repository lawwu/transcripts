[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Thursday.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.460]   John Piper has preached a couple thousand sermons
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.800]   in front of a few hundred thousand people around the world.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.840]   Only the Lord knows the true count.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.220]   I tried to put the numbers together
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.700]   and I couldn't figure it all out.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.600]   Whatever the exact numbers,
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.120]   it's a lot of sermons in front of a lot of people.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.960]   And a young preacher wants to know, Pastor John,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.040]   how your preaching has been critiqued over the years.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.720]   Here's his email.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.320]   My name is Aaron and I'm a very new preacher from Australia.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.080]   Pastor John, I've read your book, Expository Exaltation,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.860]   and I found it thoroughly helpful.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.960]   My question for you is this,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.200]   in your early years and perhaps even now,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.240]   what kind of criticisms have you received
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.600]   for your preaching?
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.000]   In particular, have you received feedback
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.400]   in regard to your volume?
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.540]   How loud do you preach sometimes?
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.860]   I love your passion,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.500]   but have people ever given you feedback,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.720]   teaching you to adjust your tone, dynamics, or expression?
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.280]   What did you do with the criticism
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.720]   and what have you learned from it over the years?
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.560]   I'm laughing because I can remember
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.680]   some really funny feedback.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.680]   So Aaron asks about the loudness, tone, dynamics.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.280]   But let me broaden this out and give you 10 criticisms
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.780]   that John Piper's preaching has received over the years
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.520]   and how I've tried to respond to each.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.400]   And it includes what he's asking, but it's more.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.900]   Number one, and the reason I was laughing,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.940]   Char Ransom, bless her heart, she's with Jesus now.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.620]   Char Ransom, one of my great cheerleaders
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.400]   in my early years as a pastor at Bethlehem,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   told me about 15 years into my ministry,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.340]   I like the early John Piper.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.000]   (both laughing)
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.200]   And I said, well, what do you mean, Char?
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.480]   And she said, the teacher, not the shouter.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.000]   And she said it with a twinkle in her eye.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.360]   And she was a loyal listener for another 15 years.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.400]   But I tried to take that to heart
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   and do what I have told so many young guys to do
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   by all means, let your affections show if they're real,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.740]   but be sure they correspond to the realities of the text
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.360]   and be sure they are varied
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.260]   because any single sustained tone or loudness
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.540]   will start to grate on the ear
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.980]   and sound artificial after a while if it's not varied.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.980]   So variety, authenticity, appropriateness to the text
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.440]   and to the audience.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.900]   And I don't think she thought I ever got it right.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.080]   (both laughing)
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.360]   I never got it right.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.900]   But some people can love you in spite of things.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.720]   Number two, early on, my wife said,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.080]   you drop your voice at the end of sentences, Johnny.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.760]   People can't hear the end of your sentences.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.740]   And that was true, I listened, that was true.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.540]   I think that's true for a lot of young pastors.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.140]   They get into a bad habit.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.780]   It was simply a bad habit.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.260]   It wasn't any constitutional inability.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.060]   It was just a learned quirk that needed fixing.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.380]   And I think I was able to overcome that.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.420]   At least she hasn't said anything about that
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.960]   for 20 years or so.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.220]   Thanks, thank you, Noel, for good advice.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.180]   Wives are your best critics often.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.860]   Number three, you're not looking at all the parts
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.480]   of the congregation.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.920]   Your eye contact with significant segments
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.360]   of the people is non-existent.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.380]   You seem to look at these two or three directions,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.300]   but you neglect this part of the people,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.780]   you neglect that part of the people,
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.060]   you don't look at the balcony.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.120]   Now that was extremely helpful.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.680]   And I knew it was true as soon as they said it.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   I just want to encourage young men, for a new preacher,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.840]   just getting the content right is huge challenge, right?
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.700]   And there's not a lot of mental resources left over
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.500]   to think about, oh my goodness, where am I looking?
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.300]   But with a bit of effort and the relaxation
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.820]   that comes from experience, you can overcome that,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.100]   and then it can become second nature
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.900]   to just look naturally everywhere during your preaching.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.780]   Number four, you overuse certain words.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.280]   This is my wife again, and she's the key critic here.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.720]   This was a recurring issue over the years.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.620]   I didn't solve this.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.040]   I don't know that you ever solve this, at least I don't.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.820]   She has to tell me this every few years.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.520]   You use unbelievable too often.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.680]   You use absolutely too often.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.960]   You use precisely too often.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.160]   You use amazing too often.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.440]   Now those would be like criticisms separated
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.600]   by three or four years.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.620]   And I suppose this is why I am so insistent
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.500]   for young preachers to give serious thought
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   to finding fresh ways of saying things,
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.300]   because often young preachers think
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.140]   that if they can just say what comes naturally,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.540]   that they'll sound fresh.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.500]   That's a lot of baloney.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.560]   They won't sound fresh.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.660]   They'll sound like they're in a rut.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.660]   We default in our natural ways to familiar words
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.900]   and familiar words start to sound hackneyed,
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.880]   which will communicate to the people.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.480]   He's not really seeing fresh beauties
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.340]   in the Bible and in Christ.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.560]   He just says the same old stuff over and over again.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.640]   Number five, you sound angry.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.360]   Really?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.660]   Yikes, I don't want to sound angry.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.740]   I'm not angry.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.540]   Even if you say, "I'm not angry."
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.020]   You sound angry when you say you're not angry.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.360]   Well, that's the way it comes across.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.060]   And at one point I remember,
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.640]   I had to stop listening to Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.420]   I love Martin Lloyd-Jones because he did sound angry.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.260]   He did.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.800]   I kept listening to him and I'm thinking,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.660]   from my American ears,
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.240]   this growling Welshman sounds angry.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.760]   He's not angry, but he just sounds angry.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.140]   So I made a conscious effort to pray,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   "Lord, fill me with real, authentic joy
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.340]   and humble amazement at grace and let that spill over.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.920]   Don't let me be angry or don't let me sound angry."
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.540]   In other words, I think the best way to push out bad sounds
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.100]   is not mainly to try not to sound a certain way,
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.740]   but to sound a better way
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.340]   because you really feel that better way.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.180]   Number six, you use words people don't know.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.260]   What?
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.020]   People don't know obsequious?
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.300]   (both laughing)
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.140]   People don't know parsimonious, pusillanimous, lascivious?
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.700]   Well, of course they don't.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.040]   So get real, Piper.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.960]   Do you want to impress or do you want to communicate?
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.600]   I want to communicate.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.980]   So I tried to fix it.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.500]   And now I'm a real stickler with our seminary guys
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.020]   when it comes to taking their academic jargon
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.860]   into the pulpit.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.520]   Use ordinary language.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.620]   But I do believe that there is a place for teaching words
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.140]   that it would be good for people to know
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.960]   that they might not ordinarily know.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.640]   Propitiation, expiation, redemption, sanctification,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.020]   glorification, and lots of others
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.060]   that might not be part of people's ordinary vocabulary.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.260]   And I think this is done, can be done
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.260]   without sounding academic or too teachy in the pulpit.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.360]   Number seven, your message is too complex.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.760]   It goes over our heads.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.940]   I can remember a couple telling me that my second year,
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.820]   maybe it was my first year at Bethlehem,
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.740]   and they left the church.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.220]   They just left the church.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.920]   So I have tried to work hard
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.880]   to make complex things more understandable.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.280]   I think all the great truths in scripture
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   can be explained in understandable language.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.440]   Not necessarily acceptable language, but understandable,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.960]   which leads to the next criticism.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.600]   Your preaching is too oriented on the glory of God,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   too Calvinistic, it's too out of step
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.360]   with contemporary culture on issues like sexuality,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.160]   relationships of men and women,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.320]   too blunt and uncompromising on the sin of abortion,
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.700]   et cetera.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.580]   Now, this sort of criticism only concerned me,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.280]   not because of the content.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.320]   I wasn't gonna change biblical views to fit the audience,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.420]   but because of the proportion.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.520]   So I tried to form the habit of checking,
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.560]   checking my emphases and asking others
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.320]   to see if something was being emphasized
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.280]   that was good and true,
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.000]   but maybe out of proportion with other things in scripture.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.640]   Number nine, you don't give enough application, Piper.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.760]   You focus mainly on exposition
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.720]   and not enough on application to real life situations.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.600]   My response to this has probably been inadequate.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.360]   In fact, Tony, I wonder if 10 years of Ask Pastor John
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.100]   is my way of doing penance.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.280]   (both laughing)
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.080]   For all those years without 10 minutes of application
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.920]   at the end of the sermon, I've been catching up, right?
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.040]   If I were to try to defend myself,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.560]   I would say something like this, and maybe it's inadequate.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   I try to do exposition itself in such a way
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.640]   that even as I do it, it feels like application.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.480]   It feels relevant to real life situations.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.960]   So whether I've succeeded, I don't know.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.020]   Number 10, you preach too long.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.080]   Lots of things affect the length of a sermon
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.920]   in the local church, wearing out your nursery workers,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.440]   poor nursery workers down there waiting
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   for this long-winded preacher to get done,
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.880]   managing the ebb and flow of parking.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.200]   Say, if you got two services,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.880]   you got to get the parking lot cleared out.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.280]   The hunger of your people, can they take it?
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.580]   And my response to this criticism of length has been,
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:12.040]   I will try to keep my finger on the pulse of the people
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.680]   and all those other considerations
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.360]   and not expect or demand more of my people
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.140]   than they can gladly receive,
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.000]   as well as all those other factors.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.240]   But in general, I have found that it is hard for me
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.840]   to do adequate, faithful exposition week in and week out
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.040]   in less than 45-minute messages.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   And the folks seem to relax into that routine with pleasure.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.360]   So what I hope Aaron hears in all of this
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.240]   is that we will all be criticized.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   There is a way to take all of it to heart in some measure
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.880]   and make it part of improving over a lifetime of preaching.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.800]   Amen, yeah.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.960]   I just want to encourage you.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.340]   When I think of your preaching, I think of your smile.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.680]   You smile more than any preacher I've ever seen in my life.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.520]   That's always struck me.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.340]   I'm thinking to myself,
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.960]   "How does that fit together with, you're angry?"
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.360]   It doesn't, no.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.840]   No one smiles in the pulpit more than you do, Pastor John.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.720]   It's incredible.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.640]   Your most underrated pulpit gesture,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.840]   that's what I call it.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.800]   Think of Pastor John.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.120]   And if you want to hear more
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.840]   about Pastor John's preaching experiences,
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.920]   and who doesn't really,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.400]   you'll want to check out two other episodes
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.280]   that come to my mind.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   APJ 1374, John Piper's most bizarre moment in preaching.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.120]   It is really bizarre.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.680]   APJ 1374, and also APJ 50,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.260]   does it bother you that people are entertained
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.560]   by your gestures?
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.020]   I did a whole episode on that.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.860]   Find them both.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.760]   APJs 1374 and 50,
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.360]   at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.800]   Well, unconditional election is up next.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.840]   Unconditional election.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.000]   Isn't unconditional election just a dry theological topic
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.180]   for eggheads?
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.520]   No, we all need it.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.800]   10 reasons why you need to know
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.160]   and understand unconditional election.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.540]   That's up next on Monday.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.380]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.220]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:30.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
