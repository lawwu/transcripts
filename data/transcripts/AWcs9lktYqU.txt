[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   You're the author of the Machine Learning High-Interest Technical Debt paper, which
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.320]   I think inspired a lot of people and really resonated when it came out with me.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.520]   And so I thought maybe you could start for people who haven't read this paper by kind
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.880]   of summarizing it.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.440]   There are really good reasons to move fast.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.200]   It's sometimes unavoidable, but in doing so, we create some costs for ourselves over time
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200]   that need to be paid down.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.860]   And it's not that we can never take those costs on, but we'd better be honest with ourselves
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.240]   about what those costs are.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.160]   And at the time, I think it was underappreciated how much technical debt can be incurred through
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.080]   the use of machine learning.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.460]   Even the simplest things you can think of, like when you're first building a model, oftentimes
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.740]   if you're in a hurry, you rush and you put a whole bunch of features in the model.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.480]   Everything you can think of, you put it in there, accuracy is 0.9.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.960]   You're like, "Okay, that's pretty good, but I can think of another 20 features."
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.820]   And you put all those 20 new features in and now it's 0.92.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.760]   And then you're like, "Well, it's pretty good, but if I put another 20 features in, then
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.160]   I get 0.93."
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.380]   So we've made accuracy go up, but what could be the problem, right?
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.880]   So as I'm sure you've seen, every time you add a feature into a model, you create a dependency.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.520]   You now have a dependency on some behavior observation in the outside world.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.640]   And this means that you have a vulnerability if that behavior in the outside world changes.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.280]   And it could change because people in the outside world change.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.240]   It could change because the upstream producer of that signal changes.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.460]   you
