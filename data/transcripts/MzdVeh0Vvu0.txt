[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   Another thing that really works for my temperament,
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.960]   for my peace of mind, for my joy,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.880]   is my lack of capacity to make assumptions
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.340]   about other people's lives.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.320]   There's nobody I think has a great.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.460]   It's inconceivable, everyone's a human.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.300]   It's inevitable.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.860]   And by the way, even when someone does have a great,
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.960]   and people have had, I've had 'em,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.660]   people have had 'em eight year, nine year,
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.360]   six year, 12 year, 20 year runs.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.980]   Life is too challenging.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.640]   I know friends who I know intimately
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.940]   and know well enough to say the following,
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.200]   great 10, seven, 12 years, and then boom, child sick.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   Great 10, 12 years, and boom,
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.880]   father was the rock of the family, gone, heart attack.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.560]   So, you know, this concept that somebody's got a great life
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.440]   is like just incredibly judgmental
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.840]   and lacks like the nuances I think are required.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.720]   And I think we are at a hyperbole
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.040]   of this judgment world now.
