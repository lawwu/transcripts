[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.360]   Glad to be here.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360]   Thank you.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.080]   I've got in my hands here your brand new book called Odds On, The Making of an Evidence-Based
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.120]   Investor.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.440]   You come highly recommended to me as a guest for the show, based upon the input of previous
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.440]   guests.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   So, I'm looking forward to our conversation.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.400]   I'd love to start, though, with a little bit of your background and your story.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.560]   What's been your journey through the world of finance that has resulted in your writing
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   this book here?
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.640]   So, there's so much that I want to tell you.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.800]   I may meander and go down a path and rely on you to bring us back, but I'll start by
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.960]   saying I feel like I'm sort of accidentally in this industry.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.580]   My parents are both educators, and when I was growing up, they talked about students.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.700]   They didn't necessarily talk about clients or markets and that kind of stuff.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.000]   And much of this is detailed in the book.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.680]   I attempted to write a book that I thought needed to exist.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.240]   I hadn't found anything like this where you buried all the wonky technical stuff inside
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.680]   of real-life stories.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.440]   That's essentially what Odds On, the making of an evidence-based investor, is.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.840]   It's the wonky buried into life stories to make it readable and sort of disguise the
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560]   pain of learning a little bit about how I think markets work.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.480]   But I'll tell you, I went to law school, and I had an advisor in law school who said to
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.260]   me, "You know, I'm tired of so many kids coming in here with the wrong idea of what being
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.400]   a lawyer is all about.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.120]   I want you to go read this book, and this book will tell you what being a lawyer is
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   all about."
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.040]   The book he gave me was later made into a movie called A Civil Action.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.320]   And it's not necessarily an inspirational story.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.400]   So I came back to him and I said, "Man, this makes me nervous.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.520]   It makes me think I'm going to be $70,000 in debt."
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.160]   And we just had a guy come into the law school class and say, "If you're not in the top 10%
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.840]   of the class, you're going to be desperate for a job, and there aren't that many jobs."
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.960]   And so I just sort of started rethinking my plan.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.840]   I had an important lunch with my dad, and I said, "Dad, I don't know what I'm going
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   to do.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   What do you think I should do?"
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.660]   And he was like, "Well, I know you planned on going to law school, but you've always
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.760]   been interested in how financial markets work.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.800]   And we don't have anyone in our family who's in that business, but I think you should get
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.420]   in that world and just kind of find your way.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.920]   Get around smart people.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.080]   You're an intellectually curious person.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.460]   You'll find your way."
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.600]   And so after that lunch, I left law school and I got a job at a brokerage firm.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.280]   And that's where I learned what not to do.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.520]   At the time, I didn't know that I was going to learn.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   I was going to sort of see the nasty underbelly of the industry.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.520]   But in many ways, it was a good experience because I saw all the kinds of traits, behaviors,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.280]   and characters that I knew I did not want to emulate or become myself.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.400]   What calendar year was that?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.960]   This is 1999, and I'm in my 20s at the time.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.200]   And so the whole first section of the book is about that experience, is about sort of
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.400]   a coming-of-age story and trying to figure out how this business works.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.280]   How do other people help serious investors become wealthy, successful, have financial
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   freedom?
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   How do they do that?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.200]   And I kept thinking there was a system, there was a process, there were like these servants
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840]   who wanted to really help others.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.320]   And what I found was just pure salesmanship and selfishness.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.720]   And so the first section of the book is about what I would say, like, what's the problem?
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.840]   The middle section of the book is what I think is part of the solution.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.820]   And then the last part is about sort of what I chose to do about it in my own life.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.880]   So I'm deeply proud of this book and my own journey in this industry.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.600]   But it took me about two years to write this book.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.320]   And my desire was to make it highly readable, super relatable.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.960]   And the feedback I've had from people is that we've accomplished that.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.640]   So after the brokerage firm – and we'll talk about what's the problem, what's
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.240]   the solution, and what you do.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.960]   But you stayed and you've worked at the brokerage firm for the last 17 years?
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.640]   Or where did you go from there?
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.600]   No, I didn't last very long actually.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.840]   I lasted longer than many of my comrades.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.680]   As you might know, the fail rate when they fill a class of like financial advisors in
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.080]   training, you've got about – they think two in 10 will survive.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.240]   So I made it quite some time I'd say.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   I made it past the series seven, did all that stuff.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.520]   And then just couldn't take it anymore.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.560]   And there are lots of good stories around sort of what pushed me over the edge that
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.760]   are in the book.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.720]   But about that time, I got super lucky.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   And this is probably – this is like one of my favorite stories from the book.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.760]   She's now my wife, but my girlfriend at the time said, "Hey, let's take a trip
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.600]   to Las Vegas during March Madness."
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.640]   We go to Las Vegas and she goes, "Oh, I forgot to tell you.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.600]   There are some people here who are from St. Louis that I want you to meet.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.800]   We're going to have lunch with them."
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   And their names are the Goldbergs.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.880]   And they were like, I don't know, 25, 30 years older than us.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.520]   And I said, "Man, it's March Madness.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.240]   We're here with some family.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.000]   We're betting on these basketball games.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.440]   We're having a great time.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.360]   Why do we want to go have lunch with some people that we could have lunch with in St.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   Louis?"
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.000]   And she said, "You know, these are just awesome folks and they're here and they have
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   time and we have time.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Let's meet them.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.560]   Plus, Ed Goldberg works in financial services and you may find something interesting to
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560]   talk about with him."
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560]   Okay.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   We go to lunch.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.320]   Ed is a very sort of mild-mannered person, not a salesman at all, opposite of what I
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.840]   had experienced at the brokerage firm.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.600]   And at the end of our lunch, he sort of casually says, "Hey, a partner of mine just wrote
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.320]   a book and it's done okay and you might have an interest in reading about it if you
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   love this industry."
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.560]   I said, "Well, I'm not sure I love the industry, but I'd love to read the book your
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   partner wrote."
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.120]   He said, "Well, when I get back, I'll give you my copy."
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.320]   So when we got back to St. Louis after that trip, I didn't realize this, but the first
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.480]   100 pages of that book, which is a book by a guy named Larry Swedro, it's called The
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.800]   Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.120]   The first 100 pages of that book changed my life.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.200]   I said, "I have to go work at this firm because here's a firm that uses logic, data, and
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.560]   evidence to help real people.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.100]   It's not all the salesmanship stuff.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.880]   This is the good stuff.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.560]   There's a system and a process here that is robust and repeatable and reliable.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   I love it.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.460]   I got to get there."
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.040]   So I called this firm.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   It was just getting started.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.720]   It was a tiny little firm at the time.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.600]   Now it's much larger, but it's called Buckingham Asset Management.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.480]   They're based here in St. Louis and the guy who wrote the book was here in town.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.440]   I just beat on their door and pounded and pounded and pounded until they were willing
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   to kind of let me in.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   They had no jobs.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.640]   You kind of had to make a job.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.840]   You had to convince them that you were so passionate about this approach that they would
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   let you in.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.400]   That's what I did.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.920]   I fell in love with sort of an indexy, passive approach.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.240]   I think there are additional layers to it.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.400]   I've sort of evolved even beyond just like a simple index fund myself over the years,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.920]   but I love the approach.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   I love the story.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.120]   I love what the academic evidence said.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.280]   It was such a contrast to what I had experienced in the brokerage firm.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.240]   So let's talk through as a structure for our show the three parts.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:38.480]   And first, what's the problem with the world of – I mean is it safe to call it mainstream?
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.920]   It's hard for me to know what's mainstream now and what's not mainstream in terms of
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.000]   actual practice because there's been such a change in the last decade.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.680]   But what's the problem with traditional financial services?
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.560]   I would say – so the root of the problem from my perspective is just the model.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.000]   There are good people trapped in a bad model, meaning the firm is on top and the client
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   is on bottom.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.920]   Obviously, there's been this huge shift of people becoming independent investment
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.760]   advisors and fiduciaries and all that stuff.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.160]   And I would just say the nice thing about the model that I'm in and so many people
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.120]   seem to be transitioning to is you really can put the client on top and you're not
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.880]   sort of beholden to a mothership that uses words like production.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.560]   Even though ultimately every business needs revenue to succeed, the culture and the focus
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.960]   is so very different.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.920]   I mean I detail this story in the book, but there's one – my job every day while I
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   was in training at this firm, the original brokerage firm, the place where I learned
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   what not to do.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.400]   One of my jobs was every day to create this – they called it the blotter.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.760]   And I was supposed to cut out stories from all the big newspapers.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.160]   But really no one read any of the top stories that you would put together.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.560]   It was all about what was in the lower right-hand section of the paper, which was the day prior's
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   production numbers.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.800]   And that production mentality, that sort of self-orientation or selfishness that was like
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.640]   I am going to make money.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.480]   If I happen to help the client along the way, that's a nice thing.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.280]   That's a peripheral benefit.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.400]   But that wasn't the focal point.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.200]   And to me that is at the root of the problem.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.600]   Not all regular people understand the term fiduciary.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.360]   But from my point of view, it's a very important distinction.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.920]   And culturally, I just have found that in the independent investment advisor world,
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.640]   no matter what your investment philosophy is, the aim is to help serve clients, not
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.400]   necessarily to sell products.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.880]   Every day when I was at the brokerage firm at lunchtime, we had a mutual fund wholesaler
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   who would come in, tell us how his fund was the best in the world, show us his three-year
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.440]   performance numbers, buy our lunch, and then leave.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.480]   That was every day.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.840]   And in my world now, that doesn't exist.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:08.400]   No one tries to sell anyone else the flavor of the day or the fund of the month.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.360]   That just doesn't exist.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   What's more, people in my world I feel like are talking about how they can really serve
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.120]   clients, what they can do to add value to their lives, what they can do to simplify
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.640]   and provide transparency.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.320]   Man, in the old world, there was no transparency.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.880]   In fact, opaque was the best way to be because no one could tell how much money you were
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.320]   making from people who sold bonds.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.840]   And I think still to this day, one of the most opaque markets is the fixed income market.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.680]   If you ask somebody, I meet people every day who say, "My broker does my bond trades for
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.680]   free."
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.120]   And nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.520]   You just don't have the technology to know what they're charging you.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.160]   You don't understand markups.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.040]   And it's not the investor's fault.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.440]   There's just no transparency.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.640]   So I mean, beyond just selfishness, the transparency piece and the simplicity piece is really,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.040]   I think it's getting better.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.960]   This is the negative part of the discussion.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.920]   I'd say I'm an optimist, so I think things are getting better.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.280]   I think transparency and just this age of information is allowing people to become better
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.440]   informed, reducing the odds that someone could be taken advantage of.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.560]   But I had heard someone say that there's a thing called, and I forget the guy's name
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   who wrote this book, but the trust equation was basically credibility plus reliability
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.520]   plus intimacy, but all divided by self-orientation.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.560]   So if you are credible, reliable, and could build intimacy, that's all good.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.040]   But if you're a selfish pig, you can ruin everything on top.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.360]   And from my perspective, that is at the root of what was wrong.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.240]   The model didn't help people be anything other than selfish.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.800]   And of course, there are exceptions.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.320]   There are people doing great work inside of a yucky framework.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.240]   But I think the migration to the independent space and to have a more sound investment
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.640]   approach for clients, I think that migration is just going to continue to happen.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.640]   Okay.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.200]   So let me categorize so I understand.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.720]   Your book jacket says you're the co-founder and president of Hill Investment Group, an
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   investment management firm.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.040]   So is this an independent RIA that you founded?
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   Yes.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.200]   So 10 years ago, myself and one other person that worked at this firm called Buckingham
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.520]   Asset Management, we left and started our own firm in June of 2005.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   Okay.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.960]   So as an RIA, you're a fee-only financial planning firm.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   Yes.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.440]   And what type of clients are you working with?
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   Well, we have 130 clients.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.080]   Half are from somewhere outside of St. Louis, Missouri.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.000]   We have an office in Houston, Texas.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   I would say most of the clients are corporate executives or entrepreneurs, people who have
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.840]   been successful.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:59.280]   And then some are new professionals, an orthodontist, a lawyer, a professional who is really a serious
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.240]   investor, meaning that they're saving a significant portion of money that they don't need to live
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.440]   off of.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.400]   So we have a good broad mix, but we have a small number of clients.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.560]   We have about, I don't know, 500 million under management.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.200]   And we're very careful about how many clients we add because we care deeply about our service
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.080]   levels and volume, in my opinion, is the enemy of service.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.960]   If you have a bazillion clients, you can't know them.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.280]   And knowing them, I think, is central to actually adding some value.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.440]   And do you charge fees purely based upon AU assets under management or do you charge fees
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   for planning?
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440]   Do you charge hourly fees?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   How are your fees structured?
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:43.560]   I mean, we charge a simple fee schedule, like a flat fee schedule, 75 basis points on assets
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   we manage.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.000]   I don't necessarily even think that's perfect.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.620]   Like I do think we should probably modify it.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:55.320]   But in the spirit of true simplicity to the extreme, it's the easiest thing I have found.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.360]   So like we say, we want our clients to know fees, returns, and allocation.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.900]   Like if you know those three things, irrespective of your investment philosophy, they're like
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900]   your vital signs.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:11.920]   You'll feel a greater sense of understanding and you'll be sort of liberated in some ways
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   from worrying.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.500]   So I always want you to know what your fees, returns, and allocation are.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.240]   Then I need to keep those things very simple.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.740]   If you have to get a calculator out to figure out what your fees are, to me, that's bad.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.940]   So we've opted for a pretty simple, I think, schedule.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.380]   So no grading or just minimal grading?
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.140]   Well, we only change our fees once people get really big.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.060]   So like if you're over, we participate in this thing called the Schwab Benchmarking
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:47.420]   Survey, and it reveals that over like, say, $8 to $10 million, we would negotiate down.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:52.540]   So none of our biggest clients are paying 75 basis points.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:59.340]   And the hard part is we want to have our own version of a betterment or wealth front or
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.140]   a smaller portfolio solution.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.100]   We haven't figured that out yet.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.860]   So I would say we're pretty boutique-y.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.780]   Most of the people we work with have been successful and have significant wealth or
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.260]   on their way to that point.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.380]   But I would love to figure out a solution that works perfectly for our firm that allows
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.780]   us to work with more people.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   Okay.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.660]   So I've got an understanding, and I love what you're talking about.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.180]   I love the little bit of your story.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:35.460]   And well, before I ask you a hard question, so you defined the problem.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.980]   You defined it as the problem is the model.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.700]   The firms are on the top, and the people are on the bottom.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.660]   And so in the context that you're describing, a smaller in terms of measured in terms of
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.420]   number of people, small independent firm, you just have you and a couple of advisors
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.980]   and some support staff is what it sounds like, and you're serving these 135 families, very
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.380]   intimate relationships.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.460]   A lot of hands-on, very clear, simple, and transparent.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.900]   So that's been your solution to the problem.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.140]   Is that the solution for the industry?
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.780]   Is that the solution for the industry?
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.020]   We all have to make our own choices and have our own experiences.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:29.700]   I would just say for me, what I realized is that I care deeply about having an investment
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:35.120]   philosophy that allows me to sleep well at night and feel like I have the best mathematical
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.860]   chance for success.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.620]   So at my core, that's something that when I read this book that I mentioned earlier,
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.220]   this Larry Swedrow's only guide to a winning investment strategy you'll ever need, which
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.060]   by the way is an unfortunate title if you're going to go on to write 14 more books, if
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.540]   you call it the only guide.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.540]   Indeed.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.460]   But I would say when I read the first 100 pages of his book, I was like, this is what
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.740]   I'm meant to do.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.920]   This is what I'm supposed to be doing.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.740]   This process and this approach based on academic evidence makes me feel good about what I could
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.380]   do for other people.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.780]   And I think part of the reason I mentioned my parents being in education is because I
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:22.900]   think at the core, one of the things I feel is my unique ability is taking a complex subject
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.580]   and distilling it down in such a fashion that a regular human could understand.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.780]   Now obviously there are super technical people who want all they can get.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.580]   They want to know how to do this themselves and they may come to work in our industry
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.260]   and make similar choices to what I've made or different.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.340]   But for me, I'm an accidental entrepreneur.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.380]   I wasn't a kid when I was a kid who had a lemonade stand or who had a newspaper route.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.140]   I didn't know I was going to become a business owner.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.980]   I love the firm where I worked.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   It was independent.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.100]   It had its aim right at serving clients.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:00.180]   But myself and one other guy who's 30 years old, by the way, there are seven of us who
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.060]   work in our firm today and we've just slowly grown over time.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:14.980]   But from my perspective, becoming an independent firm was a phenomenal choice because now the
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:20.220]   technology is so good that I can compete with anyone from JP Morgan to Goldman Sachs to
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.100]   Northern Trust to the headquarters of Edward Jones is based here in St. Louis.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.380]   We have everything I could want.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.860]   If I want to choose the best resources available, I can go get them.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.900]   They're affordable for my firm.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:41.260]   We take the fiduciary mindset not just with respect to the products or investment philosophy,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.260]   but with respect to tools and resources.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:51.340]   Now an independent small firm like mine can have access to really powerful technology
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.020]   tools that make people's financial lives better.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:01.220]   That one piece to me is like, I don't know why someone wouldn't choose this.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.420]   Even the choice between working at a huge firm where you basically have to accept whatever
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   resources they provide versus being able to choose yourself.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.660]   I like the idea of having the control.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:18.420]   On this other area too, it's so much fun to work with people you want to work with.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:24.640]   When you have control over what your filter is like, when I go home at night, I generally
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.620]   feel energized because I work with people who give me energy.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.100]   I don't work with people who bog me down.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.340]   We're able to filter.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.660]   We were lucky enough to get off to a great start when we started our firm and be able
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.060]   to choose the kind of people you work with.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.060]   We don't have any jerks.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.780]   We say the kind of people we want to work with are people who either understand our
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.960]   approach or have the ability to understand the approach.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.180]   They want to delegate, meaning they don't want to do this themselves.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.700]   They're fun to be with.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:55.000]   I know that sounds squishy and soft, but we take that seriously.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.140]   We care about the kind of folks we spend quality time serving.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   It's awesome.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.200]   That's a long answer, but the answer is yes.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.920]   I think this is a phenomenal solution.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.280]   I think it's a great direction.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.640]   I think it's great for clients.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.520]   It's great for us.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.600]   I don't know what I would change.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.120]   I'm pretty introspective and constantly thinking about things that we could do better.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.080]   I just feel like right now, it's an embarrassment of riches for independent firms.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.240]   We have so many tools and resources.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.120]   When I go to conferences, it just feels like if you could dream up something you want to
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.320]   provide to your clients, somebody could make it.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.160]   What was the – I've not read Swedro's book, nor am I familiar with what he is teaching.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.120]   What was he presenting in the first hundred pages that was so impactful for you?
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.960]   For me, it was really – so if you go back and you think about what I've been hearing,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.440]   it was like all these guys who were picking stocks or timing the market were all gurus
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.640]   and they all had – everybody outperformed the market.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.440]   Then I read his book and it was like, look, all the academic research basically says,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.760]   hey, it's hard to beat the market.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:06.000]   The people who try to do it, some do, but we can't predict in advance who will do it
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.520]   and the ones who did it last year aren't the ones who are going to do it next year.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.400]   Your best option if you believe all that stuff is to own the market.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.800]   Get low-cost diversified exposure to global capitalism and just go to sleep.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.960]   Don't even pay attention to it.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:29.160]   That rocked my world because I had just come out of a place that was completely the opposite.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.320]   It was, hey, pay people high fees because they can outperform.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.960]   If you want to get rock star returns, you got to hire the rock star.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.560]   Here I was reading about basically the data.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.000]   If you chose to hold people accountable to what they said they could do over long periods
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.400]   of time, it's very difficult to outperform or to pick the people who outperformed and
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.600]   that just blew my hair back.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.360]   I couldn't believe that was true.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   I couldn't believe that there were so many people in the world who did something very
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   different.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.160]   I was like, this is the thing, Joshua, I would say that I could not get out of my head.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.880]   I was like, if people know what I know, they will change their behavior.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.640]   They will do things differently because if everybody read the first 100 pages of this
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.360]   book, they would make different decisions.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.200]   For a long time, that's just what I said to people like prospective clients or people
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   I wanted to hire.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.280]   I was like, if you know what I know, you'll make different decisions because you're a
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   smart person.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.960]   >>It is funny.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.480]   I am 30 years old.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.160]   I started in the financial services business in 2008.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.560]   I was 23 at the time.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:40.080]   For me, I never participated in that brokerage, promote our mutual funds as being better than
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.400]   everyone else culture.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.800]   First, I had spent years of reading and studying it from a personal finance level before I
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.600]   ever got into the professional level.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.840]   I was pretty thoroughly convinced that it's pretty tough to outperform the market.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.480]   Then when I got into it, I just assumed, well, I don't have any skill in outperforming the
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   market.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.920]   I never even tried to differentiate myself from the perspective of investment outperformance.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.240]   That's a losing game from the beginning.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.840]   I was always shocked when I ran across people who didn't have that perspective.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.600]   People would ask me, what makes you better?
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.960]   I was like, nothing.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.320]   I'm no better from the investment perspective.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.200]   Why on earth would you think that anybody who's sitting here in a suit and tie actually
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   taking the time to meet with you as an individual person is superior to any other financial
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.440]   advisor with a suit and tie?
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.920]   The guys and gals who are better, they're not meeting with clients.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   There's no time.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   There's no ability for them to meet with clients.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.840]   It always has been surprising to me given the preponderance of the evidence that anybody
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:49.400]   could believe that my guy from this brokerage firm can call me on the phone and give me
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.120]   better stock tips than this other person.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.400]   But I recognize that that is largely due to the massive transformation that's happened
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.720]   in the last 20 years in the world.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.200]   I realize that it takes time for that to filter down to two people.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   Go ahead.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.800]   - Can I ask you, so I love what you just said.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.120]   I love that you didn't have to get burned to understand this yourself because so many
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.760]   people I meet, they come to this after having had a really bad experience.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.200]   In fact, when I lost some money with stocks that I had purchased, this is in the book
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.880]   too, Larry Suedro says to me, I thought you read my book.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   I said, I did.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.160]   He's like, why didn't you get rid of those individual stocks?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160]   I said, I don't know.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   I just couldn't pull the trigger.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.600]   He was like, well, chalk it up to tuition.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.120]   The money you lost is just a tuition payment.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.920]   You learned a valuable lesson.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.680]   So good for you for not having to go through some of that pain and getting to a good end
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   quickly.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.600]   I was just going to share one story.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.160]   Do you like Michael Lewis?
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   - Yes.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   - Okay, so I do too.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   I love Michael Lewis.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.480]   I've read a lot of his stuff.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.200]   I wouldn't say I don't love every ounce of what he's done, but I love the fact that he
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.040]   likes to choose people who make brave choices and write these big stories about them.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.840]   - And let me put it in the context for the audience.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.160]   Michael Lewis, the author of the big short, Flash, what was the most recent one, Flash
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   Boys.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   - Yep, Blindside.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:21.520]   - Right, so these very, I mean, they're beautifully well-written, but these very impactful investment
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   books.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.440]   - And Moneyball too, which Moneyball was basically the story of how data and the analysis of
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:34.720]   data was being used in baseball to help poorer teams compete with richer teams, which I love.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:40.280]   I think that story has many parallels with the story that I wrote.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.000]   But one of the things I was going to share with you is I saw Michael speak a couple times,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.560]   but once I saw him speak at a conference and someone said, "How have you," I mean, here's
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   a smart guy.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.760]   He had a phenomenal job on Wall Street, wrote about it in Liar's Poker.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.800]   "How do you invest your own money, Michael?"
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:02.480]   And he said, "You know, I'm from Louisiana, and in the Lewis household, we did just whatever
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.120]   our dad did and our dad did what our granddad did.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.960]   So you went down to the Merrill Lynch office and you signed up and you made an account
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.640]   and you listened to whatever this broker that their family had used for years said to do
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   and you did it."
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.680]   He said, "That's what I did until two of his best ideas went belly up."
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.200]   And he's like, one was like Lehman Brothers, Bonds, and the other, I can't remember, but
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.880]   he was like, "I just, I didn't even think about it.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.520]   You just did, you did what your parents did."
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.480]   And also, I mean, I think about it, you know, especially in certain parts of our country,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.520]   your parents don't talk about money.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.260]   They talk about money less than they talk about politics and sex.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:48.200]   So in terms of like how our world is evolving, for a lot of people, if they weren't, if you
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.960]   didn't have like sort of like transparency and open communication about money, what it
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.440]   does for your family, what you value about it, how your family makes important financial
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   decisions.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.120]   I mean, we really are starting from sort of like a very low baseline.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.340]   If for years and years or generations and generations, people just sort of did whatever
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.780]   their parents did or whatever their grandparents did.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.120]   And that thing, that decision wasn't even really discussed.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.280]   It was just sort of like, you just did it and you just did it because that's what Louis's
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   do.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.480]   I mean, he shared that story and then said, you know, "Then I made a big change and now
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.520]   I work with an independent advisor and now I have a plan and now I feel so much better."
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.600]   I mean, I think here you have a very sophisticated, smart person, went to Princeton, arguably
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:39.240]   one of the best storytellers of our time saying, "Even I made decisions without sort of like
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.520]   a really thoughtful process.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.240]   I just did what we Louis's did."
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.600]   I mean, that tells you to me that a lot of people are, it's going to take a long time
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.360]   for a lot of people to make big changes because this is just a topic that for years and years
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.960]   and years, people just taboo.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.520]   You know, either people don't think they have enough money or they think they have too much
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.360]   and they don't want others to know about it or whatever.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.600]   People don't talk about money, what it means to them, what it does for them.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.000]   And so I think there's just, there's a lot of work to be done.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.760]   And I love doing that work.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.800]   I love, I mean, if we worked with computers and robots, this would be a really easy story.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.640]   Hey, active managers have a hard time winning.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.760]   You can put the odds in your favor.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   Here's how you do it.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   Oh, great.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.760]   Let's do it.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   But that's not how it always works because we're dealing with humans who have history
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.320]   and legacy and their own money stories and their own issues and their own fears.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.000]   And it's that the psychological complexity is the part that fascinates me probably the
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.040]   most because the indexy versus, you know, active kind of stuff.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.440]   Like that's, that story to me now is a little bit less interesting.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.120]   It's how do you connect with a real human to get them to make better financial decisions
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.320]   that matters the most and is the hardest.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.000]   Subtitle on your book is "The Making of an Evidence-Based Investor."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.640]   This evidence-based thing is kind of a popular term these days, evidence-based medicine or
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.840]   evidence-based blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.280]   What do you mean by that subtitle?
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.440]   So first I would say I like words, but we've never, no one's ever found a good word to
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.320]   describe I think an investment approach that is something more than index funds, something
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.120]   more than passive.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:33.320]   It's what is it that we can learn from academic research or from science that will help us
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.680]   make more money?
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:40.280]   What is, what's there that is repeatable and reliable and robust in the way of scientific
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:47.600]   research that will allow a person to feel like they have the right kind of investment
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   approach?
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:55.800]   So evidence-based to me is the best name that is available for that kind of thinking.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:04.560]   And really what I tell you, for the last 16 years, I've been, I'm 42 years old, for the
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.840]   last 16 years, I've been giving away books to friends, family, prospective clients, anybody
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.560]   I could find and said, "Hey, look, check this stuff out.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.400]   I get really turned on by this.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.120]   Let me know what you think."
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.720]   And after I would give them the book, I would check in with them and I would say, "What
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   do you think?"
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   And they'd be like, "Well, I stopped reading it.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.720]   I didn't make it very far."
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   "Why didn't you make it very far?"
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.000]   "Because I got bored."
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.960]   And what I realized was, you know, most people reading about finance, it's boring.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.720]   And it took, not everybody was turned on by the same stuff.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.280]   Like if you say evidence-based investing, that's a snooze fest for most people.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.480]   So the reason I chose to write this book and do it by, you know, framing it all in my own
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:47.560]   stories was because I thought I could get people to pay attention long enough if I use
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.160]   my own experience and am vulnerable and share with people like some moments in my life that
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.040]   weren't all that great where I didn't have it all figured out, where I was struggling.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.600]   I thought I might get people to stay tuned and actually get injected with a little bit
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.640]   of the stuff that I'm obsessed with that I wanted them to take hold of in those other,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.600]   you know, books that I gave away for 16 years that they didn't make it through.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.480]   So I really tried hard to bury the stuff that I want people to know, some of the investment
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.560]   basics I think.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:23.640]   I tried hard to throw that into stories from my own experience.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.920]   As I mentioned before, so far the thing that has made me the happiest is that people that
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.720]   wouldn't read the prior books I would give them made it through this.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.000]   And when I asked them a few questions to see if they retained some of the stuff I wanted
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.400]   them to retain, the answer has been very positive.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.680]   Ted Grennan: With regard to investment philosophy and evidence-based investing, let me tell
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:51.360]   you just briefly where I came to as far as the ideal approach for a financial advisor.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.760]   And you can let me know if or where you think I'm wrong in terms of where I came to.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.960]   I'm not a financial advisor anymore.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.800]   I have no firm, no affiliation, no connection to any financial advisory firm.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.600]   But I started with a company called Northwestern Mutual, a big insurance company.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.360]   And I started in the first few years by primarily working in life insurance.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:23.080]   And I transitioned over to investments as I built my skill and expertise in my marketplace.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.120]   I didn't have anybody to work with and I didn't have any knowledge.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.760]   So about three years in I started working and I chose to focus on the type of client
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.720]   that you outlined as far as the mass affluent.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.480]   I didn't have any ability to work with somebody with $20 million.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.760]   I had nothing special to bring to them.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:47.640]   But I could serve effectively either high-income earners who were young or wealthy retirees,
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.960]   people who had anywhere from half a million to a few million bucks, that type of scenario,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   which is exactly the same type of client that everybody else is targeting as well, it seems
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.200]   like sometimes.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.040]   But I came to the conclusion that the only major impact that I as a financial advisor
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.840]   could have was number one, to give people a confidence with their actual financial plan.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.920]   People don't want investments.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   They want money.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   They want income.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.480]   They want to know that their life and their goals are going to be realized.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:22.600]   The reason we invest, the only reason we invest is simply because we value something that
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.960]   we're going to get in the future more than we value what we could spend the money on
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   today.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.060]   Without that, there's no rational reason to invest.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.640]   So we have to make that very clear and spend our time focusing on that.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.440]   So I came to the conclusion that I could offer really great financial planning and really
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   good financial planning from the perspective of here are your goals.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.880]   Here is the elegant and appropriate way to reach them.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.200]   I could offer a lot of great service with good technical financial planning, the CFP
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   stuff.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.080]   Here's how you just make sure you're not making any big mistakes, overspending, etc.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:03.520]   And then from the investment management perspective, the person who was the most influential in
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:09.840]   my life was Nick Murray and Nick Murray soundly convinced me that I could provide a tremendous
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:18.680]   service with helping people manage their own behavior and that as an advisor, the thing
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.200]   that we as individuals are the worst at, it's not knowing what to do.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.360]   It's actually doing it in the same way that many times the biggest benefit that a personal
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.540]   trainer brings, sometimes it's the knowledge of which exercise to do and how many repetitions
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.500]   to perform of the exercise.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.940]   But a lot of times it's the accountability and having somebody there to simply say, "Okay,
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.940]   do this.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.920]   Now do this," and so that you don't have to worry about it.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.000]   So I came to the conclusion that we as financial advisors, our biggest value proposition was
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.060]   helping our clients manage their behavior and that through good financial planning and
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.360]   good coaching, I could position them such that they would be comfortable in times of
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.920]   market downturn and also I could coach them in advance so that they would be aware of
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.960]   it and they wouldn't be caught and blindsided by their behavior.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:09.920]   After a few years, I wanted to start this podcast and so that was when I left Northwestern
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.000]   Mutual and I had gone through the process even of establishing the paperwork for an
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.280]   RIA and if I were going to do it over again, I would probably go back and build a similar
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.800]   registered investment advisory firm, similar to what you've done and hold out those things
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   that I just described because those were the conclusions that I reached of the biggest
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.240]   value that we reached in the industry and that was where I said, "This is where a financial
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:39.120]   advisor is worth their money and ignore most of the other things where they're not."
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.720]   Now whether you want to use Vanguard funds or DFA or whatever, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.280]   There's a lot of good options there that can be done, but that was what I came to.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.400]   So I'm curious.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.800]   In everything I described, are there any of those points that you disagree with?
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   First of all, if you ever decide to become an advisor again, let's talk.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.760]   I love everything you just said and I think we have a lot in common.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.760]   What city are you based in?
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.760]   Nice place to visit.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   Okay.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   So that is awesome.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.360]   I think we – I mean let's first say this.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.520]   We agree on a lot.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.200]   We deviate only in probably tiny places that is like trivial pursuit, but would you like
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.880]   for me to maybe – I would love, please.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   Yes.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.800]   So first I would say I love Nick Murray.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.280]   My firm, we're subscribers.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:37.640]   I love his voice and I fear the day when he is not around because there is no voice who
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.760]   will replace him that I know of.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   But to say that one needs to manage client behavior is – that's an excellent objective.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.240]   But where is there training for any financial advisory firm or wealth management firm as
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:05.200]   to how one gets to a level of emotional or psychological intelligence where you really
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.640]   can make a deep impact on another person?
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:18.520]   I found myself really longing for someone to train both me and my team.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:25.240]   So basically what I'm saying is I agree that a lot of this is human behavior and the management
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.760]   of that behavior and holding people accountable to what they say they're going to do.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   Huge part of it.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.640]   And from a financial planning perspective, I'll tell you, we don't say – we don't
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.000]   broadcast financial planning to prospective clients but we do financial planning.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.520]   And I would say we agree on most things.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:48.480]   But the thing where I think, at least from my point of view, I learned so much from two
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.960]   things, one experience and another person.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.040]   So this is in the book.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.240]   I don't want to give too much away if people are going to check it out or read it.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.080]   But there's a really meaningful section for me that I included in the book that is about
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:09.120]   shortly after we started our firm, I was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer, a type of
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.400]   leukemia that 10 years prior killed basically everybody who got it.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.360]   And science had revealed a drug that was considered like a miracle drug.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.880]   There's actually a book written about it called The Magic Cancer Bullet.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.320]   And unlike if you've met anybody who has had cancer, normal chemotherapy, it goes in, it's
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.020]   like a bomb and it explodes and they kill the bad stuff but they kill lots of good stuff.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.520]   This was considered like a designer chemotherapy drug.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.280]   It went in and it nipped the exact genetic malfunction right in the bud and with very
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:49.300]   few side effects, it could reduce and in some cases, people have said that it could even
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:55.920]   eliminate or shrink it down to a level that is unrecognizable, the cancer or the leukemia.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.240]   Well, I share this experience in the book because the doctors who cared for me, they
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.320]   had massive like scientific knowledge.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.880]   They both went to Stanford Medical School.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.840]   They're both brilliant people.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:15.080]   But they handled me in such a way that I felt, and this is the way in my firm we describe
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.600]   it but this may not mean that much to other people, I felt well-held.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.040]   I felt completely understood.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.840]   I mean, I would do anything that these people told me to do because I felt like they got
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.440]   me at a level that few people really did.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.040]   I couldn't, if you told me how did they do it, how did it happen?
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.280]   I detail some of this in the book but it's hard to explain.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.200]   So after this experience, I came back to my partner and I said, "Listen, I just learned
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   from people how to help others, how they helped me in a traumatic situation feel a strong
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.920]   sense of calm and direction."
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.480]   When people we serve have traumatic things happen in their lives, either through the
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.000]   markets or other things in relationships or their own health, we have to be better at
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   serving them.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.560]   We got to go beyond the spreadsheet.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.080]   We're very comfortable in like the quantitative places but we've got to get more comfortable
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.480]   and get to a place where we can make people feel the way I felt, to make people feel well-held
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.360]   or understood.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.200]   So this may sound kind of kooky to some but we hired a psychotherapist and she's mentioned
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.560]   in the acknowledgments of my book and she was just at the launch party.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.360]   She's a phenomenal resource, probably one of the top five people I've ever met in my
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:33.520]   life who comes to my firm once a quarter and helps us have deeper and more meaningful relationships
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   with clients.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.240]   I can't tell you how much further I think we've gone than just saying, "Hey, we need
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.360]   to be better at managing human behavior."
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:47.800]   We've gone to a whole other level where I'm so grateful and I love it.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:53.080]   I'm obsessed with that piece of the puzzle because as you said, whether you use Vanguard
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:59.920]   or DFA or some other combination of stuff or AQR, Bridgeway or whatever, whatever fun
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.680]   choices you're making, from my point of view, as long as you feel like you have a process
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.560]   and a belief system because I do think some of the investment philosophy stuff, even though
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.160]   Nick Murray wouldn't necessarily agree with this, I do think some of the investment philosophy
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:22.800]   stuff helps people remain calm when the apocalypse du jour is underway.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:31.320]   So if you have a scientific approach or an approach that feels like a rock, it makes
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:39.960]   them feel sturdy, then when everything else is chaotic, I think they have soft knees,
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.040]   meaning they sway a little bit.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   They don't break.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.280]   They don't fall apart.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:51.440]   So I would say that's one area where I think we've really gone beyond what I believe Nick
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.240]   has encouraged people, advisors to do because ultimately, the clients, even the smartest
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.600]   clients we work with, I don't know that they care.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:07.520]   Oh, I do know that most of them don't care about the underlying investment, the funds
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:14.040]   and the strategy as much as they do the plan and their ability to reach their own goals
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.200]   and feeling understood and well-held and cared for.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.400]   But that's been part of my own evolution.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.960]   In the past, what I used to do was beat people over the head with what I consider to be the
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.320]   data and evidence that they should fall in love with.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.160]   And what I found was people either fell asleep or were confused or frustrated, and I got
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   tired of doing that.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.880]   So then I started becoming a better listener and understanding what was important to them.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.640]   And what was amazing was when their light was on and they were talking about themselves,
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.960]   I could tell they felt really great and they wanted to reciprocate and hear what was important
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.520]   to us, but most people just don't care that much.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:56.320]   We have a few people who are sort of super nerds who love the same stuff we love and
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:01.000]   we send them special communications and let them backstage a little bit more.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.760]   But for most people, they just want to live their lives and feel like they've made a smart
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   money decision.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:14.720]   And I feel like the approach we have and almost all of what you just said is spot on.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.120]   Really thinking while I set this question up about what it was that the – two things
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.840]   that the psychotherapist taught you that were instrumental, but let me set the question
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.720]   up with my response.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.280]   What you described just now was my experience and one of my frustrations – well, what
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.680]   I learned was first, I needed to listen better.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.880]   And how I was trained was to do a few minutes of listening about goals and then to gather
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.000]   data and facts and then present plans and ideas and options.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.720]   I learned that the longer I spent listening and the longer I spent asking and finding
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.920]   out what people wanted, then the less data and facts and things I needed to present because
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   people didn't care.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.360]   They didn't remember anything about what I actually presented.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.240]   People don't understand how investments work.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.080]   They don't understand how insurance policies work.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.240]   They just don't understand how taxes work.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.320]   And so ultimately – but they do understand how you made them feel.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.400]   So I learned to spend a lot more time listening and really understanding what – how somebody
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.480]   feels and then – and that helped immensely.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:22.320]   And back to your concept of the production culture, I was convinced that it allowed me
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.720]   to go much deeper with clients, but it kept me from seeing more clients.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.000]   And if you're purely measured based upon numbers, then that doesn't work so well.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.360]   You have to be in a culture that can permit you to go deep with fewer clients and then
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.780]   you have to be working with a client base where it's a worthy – it's a profitable
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.360]   investment of your time to go deep with those clients.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.000]   With regards to like the technical proficiency, the other thing I learned was I learned to
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.640]   – in the beginning, maybe you were trained in the same way.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.920]   I put together this data book, the – what was it called?
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.640]   The book with all the illustrations and the charts and the graphs and the things like
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.000]   that and I'd carry this thing around with me and then it went digital and people would
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   put it on their iPads.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.600]   Later, I quit all that stuff and I just go out with a legal pad and I draw pictures.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.080]   And the guy who introduced us here was Carl Richards.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.200]   I told Carl Richards – I can't remember if I told him on the show or told him privately
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.360]   but I said, "I'm a little jealous of you because I used to just draw pictures for my
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.360]   clients and it worked for me and you've made a whole career out of your stupid pictures
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.840]   and I should have done what you did."
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.980]   But if you could just simply draw a picture and make it clear, like you can communicate
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:32.320]   more with a little sketch drawing than you can with data and charts and pictures because
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.800]   I still would have people remember and they'd say, "Oh, that picture that you drew, I
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   still remember that.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.280]   I used that with other people," but they don't remember the numbers.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.220]   So those are some of the – and with regard to Nick Murray, I wholeheartedly agree with
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:53.080]   you that he doesn't offer a lot of texture on how to actually implement it.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.520]   The mistake I made and I learned it quickly that it was the wrong way.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:04.660]   He based upon perhaps his experience, his age, his platform, he conveys in his writing
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.560]   the idea of taking almost a strong arm position.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.200]   You will do this because I am the advisor and you pay me to tell you what to do and
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.920]   therefore you shall do what I tell you to do.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.320]   So I picked a little bit of that up and I tried to do that a little bit.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.080]   I tried to be kind of the strong arm.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.640]   I am the advisor and you will do what I tell you or we're just going to terminate our
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   relationship.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.920]   It didn't work for me and I realized it was later that my managing director told me,
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.600]   he's like, "Joshua, what would you do if somebody came and interacted with you that
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   way?"
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   I said, "Well, you're right.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   That's not me.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.040]   I would not respond well to that."
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.440]   So I canceled that concept of strong arm tactics.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.120]   Not that – that wasn't being coercive but just simply holding my ground from almost
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.880]   a position of positional superiority.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.040]   I'm the advisor.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.600]   You need to do what I said and I realized that doesn't work for me.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.920]   It's not working for my clients and I had to adjust.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.640]   So that was a long setup to give you a little background to my question of saying what were
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.320]   two of the things that the psychotherapist taught you that were so instrumental of how
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.800]   to work with individual clients?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:16.520]   Well, let me jump back even before her and tell you one of the things that upon reflection
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.000]   I realized.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:29.780]   So back in 2001, one of the jobs I had when I went to my first independent RA and I worked
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.440]   under this guy Larry Swebdro.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.880]   I got to go with him.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:40.080]   He would go and give talks for firms around the country and I got to go with him to the
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.160]   offices that were within a drive of St. Louis.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.200]   So he needed someone to drive him and he needed somebody to fast forward his slides.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   So that was me.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.040]   I was the guy who would drive this guy to give this talk.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.240]   So let's – I'll give you a real one.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.920]   We went to Cape Girardeau, Missouri on like a Tuesday night and there were – there was
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.640]   a large crowd that an advisor there had put together in a gymnasium and it was definitely
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.760]   a weeknight and I'd say there were 75 to 100 people in the room.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   We get there.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.520]   Larry signed some books and he's going to give this talk and his slides violate every
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.640]   PowerPoint rule that we know today.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.520]   Tiny fonts.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.920]   No one could read them.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.200]   But people could tell this guy was passionate about what he was talking about.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:29.480]   He's basically talking about active funds, lose, indexy stuff, wins, be patient, take
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.960]   the long view, you'll win over long periods of time.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.400]   But all throughout the presentation I would watch people's body language and they were
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.780]   bored.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:43.840]   When he would get to the very end he would tell this story, the big rocks story, which
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.440]   is basically about sort of putting the most important things in your life first, putting
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   the big rocks in.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.600]   It's really the old story like if you have a pitcher and there's a business professor
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.320]   in front of his class and he puts these rocks in the pitcher and he says, "Is the pitcher
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   full?"
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   A bunch of the students say, "Yeah, it's full."
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.080]   Then he takes out some gravel and he pours the gravel in the bucket and the gravel goes
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.440]   in between the big rocks and it seeps down and he goes, "Now is it full?"
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   The students catch on and they say, "No, it's not full."
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.640]   He gets some sand out and he pours some sand in there and the sand falls down.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   "Is it full?"
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   "No, it's still not full."
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.680]   He gets the water out and he pours the water in.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.120]   Now it's all the way up to the top and they say, "Is it full?"
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   "Yes, it's full."
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.560]   They say, "What's the moral of the story?"
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.560]   One business student says, "No matter how jammed your schedule is you can always fit
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   more in."
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.120]   He says, "No, no, that's not it.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   That's not it."
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.680]   The moral of the story is if you don't put the big rocks in first you'll never get
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   them in.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:45.000]   When Larry would tell this story that's when people would sit up straight and pay
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   attention.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:52.120]   What he just did was he took the boring investment stuff and he created an intersection where
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.800]   it hit their real lives.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:00.560]   Your life will be better if you are freed up from worrying about whether you've picked
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.240]   the right guru.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.360]   Your life will be better if you have simplicity and transparency.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.160]   It will allow you to focus on the important things first.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.240]   That lesson never left me.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:20.080]   I just hadn't really figured out how to apply it in our own practice.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.000]   Why did people look like they were about to fall asleep for 20 slides but then on the
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.640]   last story why did they wake up?
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.320]   Because it had something to do with how this approach was going to make a difference in
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.480]   their lives.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.920]   The biggest thing that Marilyn Wechter, our psychotherapist friend I would say, did for
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:43.880]   us was remind us that all of this is connected to how we make real people's lives better.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.080]   In order to understand how we might help make another person's life better, let's understand
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.600]   what their life looks like.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.160]   Let's understand how they make decisions, how they've made decisions in the past, what
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.760]   stories they've told themselves about money.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.200]   For example, one of the most powerful moments that's depicted in the book that I had not
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.400]   long ago.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:09.620]   We have an awesome client, CPA by background, so fairly technical person.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:14.120]   One day she was sitting in our office and I said, and things have gone really well and
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   she's feeling good, and I said, "What are you going to do?
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:22.240]   You haven't spent as much money this year as we have detailed in the plan.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   Are you going to give more?
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.680]   Are you going to do this thing or that thing?"
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.000]   She says, "You know what I think I'm going to do?
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.760]   I think I'm going to pay off my sister's mortgage."
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.240]   I said, "Wow, that's awesome."
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:40.640]   Then all of a sudden I noticed she got really quiet and her eyes started getting a little
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.840]   red and she started crying.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.920]   Of course, because we've worked with a psychotherapist, we didn't have this before, but we have tissue
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   in our office.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:54.080]   I got tissue, gave it to her, I said, "Tell me what you're thinking about now."
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.200]   She said, "I'm thinking about how proud my mom would be if she were alive to know that
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.480]   I could do this for my sister."
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:11.820]   For me, that's the kind of stuff that is so exciting and is so much fun to be a part of.
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:18.760]   If you can make a difference in another person's life where you, you know, I didn't know that
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:24.200]   this was going to trigger that reaction, but being fully present, seeking to understand
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:29.720]   another human being, and caring about where that intersection is, where the intersection
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:36.280]   is between great financial planning, a sound approach, really super people who want to
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.960]   do great things in the world for the people they care about.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.240]   I love that.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:45.720]   That's what makes, you know, that Simon Sinek guy who says, "Start with why."
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.260]   That's the kind of thing that is my why.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:51.480]   That's why I love doing what I do and I'm never going to stop doing it.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.920]   I know things will change and evolve over time, but I love where I am in this business
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.960]   and being able to help people in that way.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.560]   That's the big payoff.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.760]   Those are the moments that just energize my whole office.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.880]   Tom: Love the story.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:14.280]   It's an awesome example of the power of what we can do when we actually realize and dig
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:20.560]   in a little deeper and realize that we all have goals that probably don't fit so well
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:27.840]   into the financial planning software, but once you get clear on what's possible, then
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:32.520]   you can indulge some of those goals.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.520]   I'm going to give you…
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   Go ahead.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.880]   Ryan: I did actually want to answer one other thing you said or asked me about another tip
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.200]   or idea that Marilyn has helped us with.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:49.800]   One I alluded to earlier, which is she says the buildings that fall after an earthquake
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.160]   are the buildings that don't bend.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.240]   If you're too rigid, you break.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:00.560]   One of the big questions is do you have soft knees?
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.560]   Do you sway or are you too rigid?
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.000]   How do you deal with adversity or trauma?
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.960]   One of the things that is interesting to figure out is in the people's past when they've
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.520]   had a tough time, whether it's dealing with market volatility or losing money or losing
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.920]   meaningful relationships in their lives, how do they deal with those things?
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.720]   Knowing and understanding how people have dealt with whatever trauma they've had in
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:31.120]   the past helps you understand how they may deal with it in the future.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:37.080]   For example, people who are super sensitive to market gyrations, we want to help them
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.800]   not be so sensitive to those things, but we know it's going to take time.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.920]   We have in the family profile or the mind map that we have for clients, if you are super
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.960]   sensitive to how markets move at this stage of your relationship with our firm, we have
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:57.160]   a section where we label you as high attachment or low attachment or moderate attachment.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:02.040]   How attached are you to market volatility?
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.560]   Then we make sure we talk with those people who are highly attached to those kinds of
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.360]   movements in a way that makes them feel understood.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   That in turn builds the kind of emotional resilience and strength because then they
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   say, "Hey, these people have me.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   They've got me.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   They understand me.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   They're with me.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.840]   They're here to protect and help me."
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.960]   That kind of thing, as I said before, if you have too much volume, you can't do that.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.720]   If you love that juicy part, if you love having that kind of relationship with people, if
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.000]   you have a million clients, you just can't do it.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.360]   That's why we're pretty selective and have an awesome practice because the people who
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:45.080]   work with me all share in this sort of idea that providing that kind of service is really
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:49.880]   powerful and it's rare because most people who are out there who hire some financial
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.000]   advisor, typically they think it's just about the investment management piece.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.040]   They don't know that much maybe about financial planning.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.280]   They certainly don't think or know a lot about how someone else could affect their behavior.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:09.000]   When you get to that stage of evolution, it's really fun.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Love what you're doing, Matt.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.880]   I'm now going to put you on the spot and give you my biggest rebuttals to everything that
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.480]   you've described, my biggest criticism of the financial advice industry.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:24.720]   I'd love to hear your straightforward response.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:31.960]   We obviously, as I described earlier, we came to similar perceptions and similar conclusions
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.600]   with regard to how to structure a practice.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:42.320]   If I were not doing radical personal finance, I would either be a partner or I would have
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:48.200]   a practice similar to the one that you've described because it's a very, very pleasing,
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:54.240]   enjoyable business model where you can have a high degree of satisfaction that you're
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:58.120]   making a massive positive impact in the lives of your clients.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.920]   Your clients love you.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:06.680]   Your business becomes more like a family versus a transactional customer relationship which
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.640]   is what many advisors have created is a bunch of customers that buy from them but aren't
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.440]   very happy with them.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:17.400]   However, the problem that I perceive and the reason why I do not run that type of firm
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:26.440]   now is the vast majority of people will never be able to benefit from the services of an
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.880]   advisor like that simply because they're not rich.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:35.240]   What I came to the conclusion as a financial advisor is that we as financial advisors are
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:40.920]   very good at giving excellent advice to people who have money and to people who are rich
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:48.280]   but we have no clue or concept of how to actually help people get rich because all of the things
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:55.720]   that we teach, they might possibly be applicable, maybe, but they generally don't work unless
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.280]   somebody is already rich.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.800]   That's where I set you up with that when I asked who do you work with and you said we
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.440]   work with people who are wealthy and have some wealth or people who are high income
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.680]   earners.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.600]   That's who all financial advisors work with.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.000]   They work with people who are wealthy or have high incomes.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.460]   My major premise of radical personal finance is that financial advisors are good at helping
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:19.280]   people who are already rich and the way that you get rich is by having a high income or
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.200]   by building a big business and saving a lot of money.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:28.480]   So the biggest problem with everything that you described is that it only works for people
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.240]   who are already rich and there's no way for us as financial advisors in the system you
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   described.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.600]   You said, "Okay, the problem is the people on the bottom and the firm on top and there's
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.160]   this beautiful RIA model and there's awesome tools and technology.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:47.000]   That's great but that's only ever going to serve probably 4% of the population and the
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.280]   4%, I'm just making that up simply because the top 20% are the top 20%.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.760]   Maybe we're going to serve 20% of the population but the bottom 80% or 96% of the population
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.760]   is never going to be able to make use of these types of services.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:07.280]   So what do we as financial advisors do to help the vast majority of people who you will
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:12.760]   never profitably be able to sit down with and create a mind map and create this investor
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.840]   profile questionnaire that talks about are they high attachment, moderate attachment
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.880]   or low attachment?
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.920]   What do we do to help the majority of people?
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.840]   Awesome question.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:28.160]   I'll tell you the present answer and my aspirational answer.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:34.280]   The present answer is I have sent so many people to Vanguard, it is annoying.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.360]   Someone comes to me and I care about them and they say, "Hey, we want to work with your
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   firm.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360]   Here's our situation.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.480]   Here's what we're doing."
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.440]   And I say, "You shouldn't pay us our minimum fee.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.400]   You should go to Vanguard.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.200]   Here's a proxy for the kind of allocation I like but you do whatever you want to do."
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.960]   But this is the best solution today.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   Hold on.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.480]   I want you to finish but I'm going to interrupt you.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.920]   Even Vanguard doesn't solve the problem because out of your 135 clients – and here's the
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.960]   challenge – out of your 135 clients, tell me just a guess how many of them worked at
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:13.360]   a mainstream middle class job and saved a half a million or a million dollars by investing
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.320]   15% of their income into a mutual fund plan over 40 years.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:23.240]   What percentage of them did that as compared to how many of your 135 rich clients got there
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.080]   because they're making multiple six figures per year, living in St. Louis, Missouri or
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.320]   other low-cost of living places or built an independent business as an entrepreneur and
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.840]   sold it or developed a high percentage?
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.880]   So I would say I agree with you.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.360]   It's a small percentage.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.160]   I would say it's probably more than 10% but less than 20%.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.320]   What I'm telling you, Joshua, is what is my present reality.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:56.080]   My present reality is I agree that we don't do a good job of teaching people how to create
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   wealth.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:02.920]   For myself, as I mentioned earlier, I feel like I'm an accidental entrepreneur.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.480]   I'm just an intellectually curious, hungry little bugger who kept rubbing up against
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.880]   people who I thought were smart and then gradually got lucky and became friends with someone
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.640]   who said he wanted to start a business and was tired of being a W-2 employee and said,
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.000]   "Let's do something together."
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.800]   The best decisions I ever made from a wealth creation standpoint were starting my own firm
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.000]   and then I had a consulting project with a mutual fund company about five or six years
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.520]   ago that was a really great project and a smart decision and worked out well for everybody
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.960]   who was involved.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.980]   Those things, I didn't go to school.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.840]   No one taught me how to do those things.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:46.240]   I would say most of the people that we work with, they either inherited wealth, they worked
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.400]   for a phenomenal company that had an unbelievable run and they had stock options and they participated
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.640]   in the unbelievable run of the corporation and were very lucky to have worked at a company
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.680]   that had that experience.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.360]   Or they owned a business and the business did well and they sold it and had a liquidity
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   event.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.160]   Our largest client we work with was a beer distributor in St. Louis.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.800]   We have a lot of old beer money.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.040]   So I have a lot of clients who became wealthy because they worked for Anheuser-Busch at
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.840]   a time when Anheuser-Busch became dominant.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840]   I agree with you.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:23.880]   There is no one teaching how one becomes independently wealthy.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.840]   I would tell you though that I do have some people, and as I said, I think it's more than
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.360]   10%, less than 20%, who were just steady, patient savers.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:42.640]   They deprived themselves of luxury items and they plotted along and they've created for
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.880]   themselves basically their own pension.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.580]   I do have some people like that.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:54.240]   But the answer for me presently is I don't have a business solution that scales well,
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:02.600]   that can help real people who make a modest income, who want to save a little bit of money.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   You're right.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.920]   I can't provide the same level of service for that person as I can for the person who
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.160]   already has significant wealth.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.480]   That frustrates me.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:16.000]   Here is one of the things that we do in our office that I personally like.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.880]   We don't have a huge retirement plan business, but I do like that when we do retirement plans,
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.280]   and they're typically for small businesses.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.080]   So an orthodontist who has 20, we have an orthodontist that's like 200 miles from where
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.440]   we are, has 20 people who works for him.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:38.000]   Good friend of mine, young guy, and started out as, will be a phenomenal client, but started
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.640]   out with like a retirement plan and a modest savings account.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.760]   He and his staff will benefit from our time together.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.940]   He will benefit in bigger service ways.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:59.060]   The staff will benefit because they'll get what I consider to be an awesome investment
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.060]   approach at a very low cost.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.320]   We have a different fee schedule, by the way, for retirement plans.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.800]   It's 50 basis points instead of 75 basis points.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.760]   That's the best thing I can do at the moment is tell people, "Here's what I know about
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.320]   if you're looking to invest your money in a smart approach, you can go to Vanguard or
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   Betterment or Wealthfront."
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.080]   By the way, Betterment, Wealthfront, that kind of stuff, I love it because to me, that's
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.440]   a much better experience than people were getting at Edward Jones.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.380]   So if somebody can have a good investment experience there and not pay high fees to
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.160]   underperform and not understand what they're doing, good.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.000]   By the time you're ready to come to someone like us, you'll have had a better experience
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.900]   and have more money and not be so sour on how this industry works.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.520]   So I don't feel threatened or weird about any of that stuff.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.000]   I like it and wish I had my own version that we could offer people.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.080]   But it is frustrating.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:52.240]   I do agree with you that there's a huge hole in the sense that no one teaches anyone how
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:59.820]   to be entrepreneurially successful or how to create real wealth or how to even analyze
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:05.220]   what their unique ability is and what the most valuable piece of their offering is.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:10.160]   So there is a huge hole there and I don't have a great solution for that.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.440]   But in the interim, I think retirement plans are a great solution.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.360]   And Vanguard is a good firm, Betterment, Wealthfront, those are good firms.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.960]   And I think the thing that inspires me is that there are better choices now than there
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.200]   have ever been for real people.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.120]   That still doesn't solve the problem that you're highlighting, but that's my answer.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.120]   Trey Lockerbie (00:10:00): Yeah.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120]   And I know I'm putting you on the spot.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.200]   I appreciate the answer.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.600]   Part of it is just I like to ask financial advisors this question and part of it is a
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:41.280]   lot of financial advisors listen to the show and I want us as financial advisors to listen.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.780]   Because as far as I'm concerned, it's very difficult for me to imagine a better solution
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.680]   than what you've described as your firm.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.680]   And there are thousands of other guys and gals all around the country doing exactly
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.840]   what you've done.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.200]   And so I see maybe there are still problems.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.220]   I'm sure you guys have some business problems that you're working on.
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:04.640]   But as far as the model, everything you described as the technology and things like that, that
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.460]   didn't exist a decade ago.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.580]   But today, I think we've effectively solved a lot of those problems.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:14.920]   Now there are still problems of how does a new advisor start?
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.240]   You or I couldn't have started in the type of firm you were at if we hadn't had a little
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.240]   bit of experience.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.640]   There's still an on-ramp problem.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.840]   There's still a training problem.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.920]   There's still some prohibitive challenges.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.360]   But we've solved the 80% of the problem.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.040]   There's just some minor tweaks.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.480]   How do we create a training culture?
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.920]   Blah, blah, blah, et cetera.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.600]   And frankly, you said, "Hey, why didn't you start a firm?"
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.080]   This is why I started Radical Personal Finance and it's my best attempt to try to figure
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:47.660]   out how do we build some sort of educational platform that will teach people how to become
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.680]   the type of investors that good financial advisors want to work with.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.520]   And I don't have a solution.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.840]   But I'm working to build the solutions and figure them out where – we can talk later.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.380]   I can tell you some of the models that I've built.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:06.160]   But this is I think where I'd love to see you and – I mean this is where I'm focused
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.400]   and I'd love to see you and smart people like you start to focus and figure out how
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.600]   to do it because that's one of the biggest areas of opportunity that we have to work
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.760]   in the general population.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.320]   My final question to you, Matt, before I give you an opportunity to tell us about your firm
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.880]   because there may be people listening who would care to work with you and who want to
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   read your book.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:35.600]   But my final question to you is back to just something tactics and this one is a little
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.600]   bit time-based.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:44.280]   As we record this here on April 19, 2016, there's a lot of changes with pending legislation
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:50.080]   coming out from the regulators about changes to the fiduciary status.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.760]   It's quite the news these days.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:59.160]   And you've described in your initial conversation here today, you described the problem which
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.040]   a lot of people have experienced and have seen and you described your solution.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:10.600]   And I'd be curious, what do you see as the current state of the market and where is the
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:17.960]   market going with regard to this transparency and client service orientation?
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:23.320]   And please include in your comments your own perspective on the pending fiduciary regulation
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.880]   from the regulators.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.480]   Matt Roberts - Okay.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:33.680]   So on the fiduciary issue, my personal perspective is I don't think they went far enough.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.840]   I don't think it's a political issue, although it was politicized.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.320]   I think it's just right and wrong.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.280]   It seems silly to me to have like a fiduciary standard on retirement accounts.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.200]   So it's like, oh, you have to have this standard on this type of account, but not on other,
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   you know, on taxable accounts.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.840]   It's just silly.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.560]   Everybody I think should be a fiduciary.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:03.120]   It's just why and what sense does it make to be able to say, yeah, I, you know, I have
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.360]   a suitability standard instead of a fiduciary standard.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.800]   It just seems silly to me.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.000]   You should represent the best interest of the client no matter what.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   But I don't, you know, my personal view is I don't wait for the government to like tell
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.040]   me how to behave.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:22.440]   You can't legislate, you know, in my opinion, proper behavior always.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:28.440]   I mean, they can change like the baseline, but the best firms that I know are operating
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.720]   at a much higher level anyway.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.960]   So this is a blip on most firms' radar.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.200]   But for firms that derive a lot of revenue from sources that this rule will affect, I
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.520]   can see where it's disruptive.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.520]   But in many ways, I think it didn't go far enough and was watered down and softened by
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.640]   the power of, you know, big firms and their lobbying efforts.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.280]   And I know like here in St. Louis, there's a very vocal politician who is like, I think,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.720]   backed by one of the bigger firms who's based here.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.480]   And it's just it's too bad because if you're really out to help others, then this is a
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480]   no brainer.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.400]   So to me, the fiduciary standard is an easy one.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.320]   And I think it was watered down a little bit.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.520]   Our industry at times is inspiring and it's also humiliating.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.280]   And that's the humiliating part of it.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.880]   It's like, why would anybody resist that change?
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.200]   I don't get it.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.920]   So that's my perspective on the legislative piece.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:33.160]   And then just from sort of where things are going and where this, you know, the industry
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.520]   and I guess just, you know, kind of how the market feels, how this little world feels.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.240]   I feel highly optimistic, but it's also slow.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:48.280]   I mean, in many ways, I think like racism, like other things that just take time and
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.920]   people, you know, there are people who are going to retire out of this industry and there
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.840]   are people that are coming into it.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:03.160]   And as people come into it, everybody I meet at, I used to be very down when I would attend
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.460]   like a continuing ed conference or something, I'd be like, you know, is this really the
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.840]   best of our industry right here?
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.320]   Are these the kind of people that are going to provide inspiration to me?
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.640]   Because it seemed like there wasn't a lot that was changing.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.400]   But now I feel like there is just so much new energy.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.000]   There's so much more sort of collaboration.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.040]   Think about like what we're doing right now.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.640]   The two of us talking and, you know, sharing ideas and someone else will hear our ideas
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.220]   and tags or put something on it that's better than what we thought of.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.400]   And that sort of like notion, I heard a TED talk one time called crowd accelerated innovation.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.240]   And it's like technology is allowing us to share ideas and improve upon each other's
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.080]   ideas so much faster than ever before that I just, I can't help but feel optimistic and
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.120]   inspired about what's coming in this space.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:54.320]   When I meet young people like people that are going to work at my firm, this story is
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.440]   in my book Odds On.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.760]   There's a young guy who came to interview with me and he said, Matt, I will work for
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.440]   free for you for two years.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.440]   Now think about that.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:10.640]   Why would a normal person want to work for free for someone else for two years?
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.680]   That's how hungry this person was to be out of the model he was in.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:20.040]   And he worked in financial services at EverJones to be out of that world and be in this world.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.400]   I mean, it's just, I see that happening, that kind of attitude, that kind of hunger for
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.280]   the kind of practice we've built more and more.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.560]   So while some firms talk about they have a problem with talents and finding good people,
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.740]   we don't have that problem.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.800]   We have lots of good people.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.280]   If I had a big enough budget, I would just keep hiring rockstar people, man, because
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.640]   I love being around great people who want to do good work.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.120]   And then just how things feel in the world to me.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.280]   I'm just a perpetual believer in global capitalism and I have no crystal ball, but I just love
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.280]   what's happening.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.080]   I love that firms like Dimensional and AQR and Vanguard just keep innovating and keep
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.360]   creating things that allow us, I think, to put the odds on the side of the investor.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:09.760]   And the analogy that to me is the best I've come up with is like when you saw, I saw Steve
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.880]   Wynn, the Vegas casino owner on 60 Minutes one time, and they asked him, they said, hey,
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   Steve, does any gambler ever really beat you?
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.160]   Does anyone ever really beat the house?
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.760]   And he said, over the long run, I'm the only winner.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.760]   The math is figured out.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.640]   And that's exactly the kind of attitude and approach that I like to give to the kind of
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.040]   people we work with.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.040]   So that's my answer.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.560]   Matt, this has been a great interview.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.880]   Tell us about the book, the book website, your firm website, and feel free to plug any
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.800]   additional resources that you'd like to provide for my audience.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.800]   Okay, cool.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.280]   So I worked for two years on this book.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.280]   I'm deeply proud of it.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.760]   It has done well by the standards that I held myself to.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:55.100]   It's called Odds on the Making of an Evidence-Based Investor.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.180]   You can learn more about that at matthallbook.com.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:01.460]   It's for sale on Amazon and Barnes and Noble and everywhere else where you would normally
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.880]   find books.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.060]   My firm is called Hill Investment Group.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.120]   My last name is Hall, but my partner's last name is Hill.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.320]   He's a very unselfish guy.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.880]   The only thing he ever asked for was to name the firm after him.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880]   So we did.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   It's called Hill Investment Group.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   It was started in June of 2005.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:21.080]   We have an office in St. Louis, an office in Houston, and clients all over the country.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.560]   And yeah, that's about it.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.000]   We're barely on social media, but you can find us on LinkedIn and Twitter and Instagram
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   and that kind of stuff.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   But I don't know.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.320]   I'm so bad, I don't even know all our names and IDs on those things.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.400]   But hillinvestmentgroup.com or our firm's motto is takethelongview.com.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.440]   So you can find or take the long view, you can find us at takethelongview2 or ignorewallstreet.com.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   We bought all those URLs.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   Good.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   Nicely done.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   Matt, thanks for coming on.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   Hey, I loved it, man.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.440]   Thanks a lot.
