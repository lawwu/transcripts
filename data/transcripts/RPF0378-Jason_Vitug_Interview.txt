[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with knowledge,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.240]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040]   My guest today is Jason Vita.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:24.800]   Jason, I'm holding in my hands your book called You Only Live Once, The Roadmap to Financial
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   Wellness and a Purposeful Life.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.560]   So if your subtitle and the slogan of my show are that similar, we're going to have a good
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.560]   interview today.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.560]   Welcome.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.560]   Hi, Josh.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   Thank you so much for having me on instead of beer.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.200]   So we're going to talk about your book, but I'd first like to kick it off.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.600]   Tell us a little bit about your story, especially as it relates to money.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.560]   Where did you start and what's been your path up to now in some of your ventures currently?
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.880]   Yeah, I think the most interesting part for many people is that I started my relationship
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.240]   with money, with working, cleaning toilets, serving drinks, and found myself four years
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.280]   later in the boardroom making a six-figure salary, moving from New Jersey where I was
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   raised to living out in Palo Alto, California.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.040]   Okay, so I'm going to stop you there because that sounds interesting.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.120]   That's good marketing speak, but I want to know more specifics.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   What type of work were you doing when you started?
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.440]   Yeah, so I started as a bartender.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.840]   I started as a bartender in Newark International Airport.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840]   Okay.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.480]   I mean, it all really started because of the fact that I never had the conversation about
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.080]   money with my parents.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.520]   I think for most people, it's so much easier for my parents to talk about the birds and
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.880]   the bees, talk about politics and religion than it was to talk about money.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   But they were forced to talk about money when I was 17.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.840]   When they sat me down and said, "Jason, we can't afford to send you to school," that
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.080]   to me was really devastating because I did all the right things.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.280]   I worked really hard.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.360]   I played sports.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.840]   I was class president, honor society, what have you.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.240]   But my parents, like many others that I've met, they made enough to disqualify me for
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.760]   financial aid but didn't have the resources or the means to send me to school.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.080]   And by school, you mean college?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.800]   To college, correct.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   And so when all my friends were going to their freshman year, I had to start working.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   And so at 18, that's how I found myself bartending, to raise enough money, to save enough money
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.800]   to attend the first year's college.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.220]   Is it legal for a bartender to be 18 years old while serving alcohol?
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.680]   In New Jersey, yes, as long as there's no money exchanged.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.840]   So I was working at first class lounges in Newark International Airport.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.740]   So you can imagine, I grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which is the fourth largest city.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.920]   It's an inner city.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.560]   And so you can imagine, here I am in the first class lounge serving people like business
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.840]   people, those who can afford to spend $5,000, $10,000 on a seat to fly anywhere around the
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.400]   world.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.920]   But then, like, no, we're struggling to find $5,000 to send me to college.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.800]   So that was one of the eye-opening experiences of how little I really had and how much others
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.080]   did.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:46.880]   And so that reinforced kind of this mentality of not having the means and wanting to make
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   money.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   But that pretty much led to me spending everything I earned just to tell others, hey, I'm not
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   that poor.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.360]   I'm not that struggling with money.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.120]   And so every chance I got to spend cash, I did.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.680]   So you didn't go to school then.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.060]   You continued working and then you got another job in California.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.800]   What actually happened that took you across the country?
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.040]   So eventually when I did get to school, I went to Rutgers University.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.580]   I was going for finance.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.560]   So I thought that everyone I was seeing was in business.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.120]   And the way for me to become successful and to make money, I needed to be in business.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.880]   And so I found myself in the business school studying finance.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:52.040]   And there's no way that I could go from serving drinks as a bartender to making the money
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.720]   that I saw people were making that were entering the first and business class lounges.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.480]   And so I said, well, I need to get into banking.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.840]   And I started my banking career as a teller.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.040]   And I worked really hard and tried to learn as much as I could.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.480]   And that got me the opportunity to grow.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.120]   So in a very short period of time, I was being promoted very quickly.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.080]   And so my income was rising.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.840]   So I was making at the time minimum wage, and in Jersey, it was around $7.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.960]   And then I had the opportunity to, from going as a teller, I became a customer service rep
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.520]   and a customer service reps and assistant branch manager, all within a very short time
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.920]   frame.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.600]   And I've always had this philosophy, which started in going to the public school system,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.440]   that I wanted to learn as much as I could.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   And I wanted to pick the brains of some of the-- and I look back now, it's like some
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.680]   of the smartest people, which ended up having to be either my work colleague or my supervisor,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   manager, and things like that.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:10.240]   And they would just ingrain certain skills that enabled me to be able to perform a job
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.040]   level that was higher than what I was being paid for.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.480]   And that also exposed me to a network that enabled me to get promoted.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.920]   And I mean, my story goes all around the place.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.640]   But eventually, I found the credit union world.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.480]   I went in as-- in the branches in the credit union.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.160]   And I wanted to get into marketing.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.040]   I always had this creative streak about me.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.520]   And eventually, four years from starting in the banking industry as a teller, I found
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.280]   myself in the boardroom for a credit union out in Silicon Valley.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   - How much were you earning in that job in Silicon Valley?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.200]   - I was earning $100,000 when I started in 2009.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:09.520]   - So to go from $7 an hour to $100,000, I mean, that goes from, what, $15,000 a year
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.160]   to $100,000, pretty fantastic, man.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   That's quite a story and an achievement in and of itself to do that in four years.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.680]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.440]   So when I go and I sit back and I can spend hours and days talking about the processes
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   and the nuances of going from being a teller to sitting in the boardroom in four years,
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.880]   it did take a lot of work.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.740]   And then as I mentioned, it had a lot to do with just increasing my value for the time
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:45.000]   that I was spending at work and also the network of people that I was meeting.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.280]   And interesting enough, early on in life, I learned the power of the people who you
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.120]   surround yourself with.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.560]   And so I wasn't one of those worker bees that was saying, "It's not my job.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.080]   I'm not getting paid for it."
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.440]   It's like, "Well, maybe it's something that I can learn and will make me more valuable."
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:15.920]   And so that in a sense, when I think about growing up with not having the luxuries of
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.440]   life, that that was really a really good thing for me to have.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.500]   - I always love the aphorism, "If you do more than what you're paid to do, the day is gonna
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.320]   come eventually when you're paid more for what you do."
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.240]   But you've gotta always start that process.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.960]   You can't expect to be paid more because compensation always comes after work is done.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.260]   You gotta sow the seeds first.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.680]   So you're at this credit union in California.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   What next?
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   - Yeah, so I was in the credit union in California and I was there as VP of Marketing and Business
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.920]   Development.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.000]   So I was in charge of growing the credit union.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.720]   And the credit union had this field of membership all across the United States and they're pretty
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.360]   stagnant for some time.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:11.180]   And it just says a really interesting side note, when I was up for the job for this VP
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:19.380]   position, I was up against two other individuals who had more experience, who had fancier degrees.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:27.180]   And I remember going and presenting and talking about my idea to help grow awareness for the
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.740]   credit union and help grow its membership.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.860]   It was all focused on education.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.220]   It was all focused on helping people like me when I saw myself in the mirror knowing
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:47.420]   that I had the resources and the means and that this financial institution can help those
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:53.880]   like me who weren't educated and/or had access to other types of products.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.700]   And so I was hired and I remember my CEO telling me, eventually we became friends, that they
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.240]   chose passion over experience.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:15.580]   And when I was in front of the board of directors and the other executives, they saw this unpolished
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:22.920]   but very passionate kid, and they put that in air quotes, that had this big, bold idea
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.280]   to revolutionize how they were marketing and growing the credit union.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.200]   And so that's how I was selected to be part of the executive team.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.280]   And I had the go-ahead to really do something really radical, which was to talk about basic
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.640]   personal finance.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:48.760]   And when you think about this, at the height of the Great Recession, that's in 2009, 2010,
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.160]   when I joined that credit union out in Menlo Park, California, everyone was still talking
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.960]   about retirement.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.360]   Everyone was still talking about investing and the future.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.880]   And I knew from my personal experiences and the experiences of those that I became friends
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.840]   with and the jobs that I had, that we were struggling day to day.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.480]   And we were struggling with basic personal finance, with basic fundamentals about banking,
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.240]   budgeting, credit reports, credit scores.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.360]   And I really wanted to go back to that, to the basics.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:33.160]   And with that, we were extremely successful in getting our sponsor.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.320]   The credit union wasn't open to everyone.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.080]   You had to work for a specific company, this particular credit union I worked for.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.920]   And at the time, it was Tyco, ADT, TE.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:52.040]   And so they realized that there was a benefit to this financial information that we were
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:59.160]   sharing, the seminar that I created, all around financial motivation, all around really basic
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.720]   information.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:08.280]   And it became the most widely requested seminar series of this Fortune 500 company all across
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.360]   the country.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.240]   And everyone was downfounded.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.800]   They hire and they pay so much money to get the big guys to come in and talk about the
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.400]   401(k)s and et cetera.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.960]   And those things were important.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.480]   But I knew that if you were struggling to pay your rent or that car payment or that
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:35.160]   credit card or debt collectors are calling you, chances are there's no way that you can
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.560]   pay towards your retirement into that 401(k) plan.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.640]   There's no way that you are performing at 100% at the workplace because you're thinking
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.440]   about your finances.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:54.160]   And so we grew very quickly in the three and a half years that I was at the credit union.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.920]   So you're looking at when I joined, it was a $65 million asset credit union.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   I left.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.400]   It was at $110 million in assets.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:10.520]   And because of the successes that we've had in a very short period of time, the board
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:18.320]   of directors and my CEO sat me down and said, Jason, we'd like to select you as the successor
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.360]   CEO of the credit union.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:29.000]   And we'd like to put you into the path of replacing my CEO when she would retire in
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.720]   a few years.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.800]   And that gave me pause.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.360]   How old were you for that conversation?
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.120]   I was 28.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.720]   Had you ever finished your college degree?
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   Yes.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.880]   I finished my college degree before I got out to California.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.440]   So at that point, I was like, this is it.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.880]   I made it.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:59.480]   I got the American dream of making six figures and living in a really beautiful place and
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.880]   getting this fancy title.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.720]   But then I just kind of looked around the stuff that I was surrounded with.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.680]   And at that point, living out in California, I was away from my family.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.600]   I was away from my friends.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.840]   They're all back in Jersey.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:24.200]   And so I just looked around and I said, wow, is this what I worked for?
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:30.820]   All this stuff that filled my apartment in Palo Alto, California.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:38.220]   And so you're looking and thinking about that I came from Elizabeth.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.120]   Now I'm living in Palo Alto, California.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.880]   Before I graduated high school, I lived in seven different houses.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.960]   My parents, my family, we moved around a lot.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.160]   We were a big family.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.120]   They had five kids and they're hardworking.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.680]   They made sure that everything was paid for.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.440]   So we never had to worry about money and they never had to talk to us about money.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   And but I didn't have all the luxury stuff.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:13.200]   I instead of getting Nike's, we got the I think it was like I don't even know if they
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.760]   make it like the Spalding's.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.800]   There is these shoes that they could get for like fifteen dollars, these sneakers.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.280]   And I'll get the hand-me-downs from my brother.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.160]   And now I'm in Palo Alto.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.240]   I'm in this apartment that's too expensive.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:38.520]   I think it was 16, a little over sixteen hundred dollars for a 700 square foot apartment in
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.200]   San Francisco, the San Francisco Silicon Valley Bay Area.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:49.840]   So quite expensive and at a walk in closet with with tags with their clothes, I mean,
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   clothes with their tags still on them, gadgets and things that I didn't use.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.400]   And I had two cars, a motorcycle, a pedal bike.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   So what have you?
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   And and I would travel.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.280]   I would travel and have those experiences.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:11.080]   And at the end, I just said, OK, well, if I had to reassess the direction of my life
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.720]   and my content and not being and being away from family for three and a half years and
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:22.600]   my friends and Jersey and now being this having this offer laid out to me, I wasn't quite
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.200]   sure if that was the you know, the path that I wanted to continue on.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   And that's when I did the complete opposite.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.800]   I resigned instead.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   So that was dumb.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.080]   Tell us more.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.240]   So it's interesting.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:49.560]   So it was I just remember the look on the faces of these of the executives and as well
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.960]   as the board of directors saying, you know, you're in this upward career trajectory.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   This is it.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.440]   And and then I knew just something was missing and I wasn't quite sure what that what that
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.400]   missing part was.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.600]   And I was equating success with all the things that I was purchasing and the fancy title.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:18.120]   And and so so eventually, when I had that moment where I had this opportunity that I've
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:24.200]   wanted for a very long time and I looked at my bank account, I looked at the things around
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.120]   me and I was like, wow, this is a reflective of success.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.520]   I thought that.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   Right.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.680]   And so I was saving.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.480]   I was saving my 401k plan.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:41.440]   I was saving I was buying, you know, the stock options for our parent company, T connectivity.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.400]   So I was doing all these really good things for my future.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   But when you looked at my bank account, you'd see every payday, the funds that were there
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   went went to bills.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.280]   And and I spent everything else on things just to keep me satisfied.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:05.400]   And in the book, I I would say that I was I continue to mindlessly consume and obsessively
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.480]   complain about my situation.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.760]   And and I remember having this conversation with my VP of finance and saying, I think
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.880]   I just need to make more money.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.840]   And and so I was one of those individuals, whether through luck or whether through circumstance,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:29.160]   I was every time I asked for a raise, I would get it and then some.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:41.680]   And so even before I decided to to quit officially or resign my position, my my the executive
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.240]   team, the CEO and the board of directors offered to provide me down payment assistance to buy
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.920]   a home.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.640]   And and I looked at this then.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.640]   Right.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.680]   It's like these are the golden handcuffs that people are talking about and they want to
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.800]   keep me here.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.200]   And I wasn't necessarily sure if this is what I want to continue on.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.900]   And I thought I was at that moment.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.680]   And I think for many of us, right, when we're in our mid to late 20s, we're still trying
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.120]   to discover who we are.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.540]   Many people are successful and they're in that career.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:18.280]   They're in that financial situation that they are extremely happy with.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.240]   And others and many others that I've met is that we're still trying to define our life.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   We're still trying to define our purpose, the meaning.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   And I thought that purpose and meaning all equated to the size of the income that I was
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:40.560]   making or that I was hitting these just financial milestones in terms of contributing to my
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:48.680]   401k, contributing to different different things to set my life and be able to live
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.720]   my life the way I wanted to live it when I was 70 years old.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:20:02.520]   And all those thoughts all culminated to to the moment where I said I quit and quitting
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:08.880]   landed me the opportunity to free myself from any work obligations.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.760]   And in 2012, I found myself backpacking around the world.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.480]   I went to 20 countries in 12 months, Southeast Asia, Central America, Western Europe.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.840]   And then I started having these conversations with people who were telling me I was lucky
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.080]   that I was American and individuals.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.520]   And it didn't matter what part of the country, what part of the world I was going to, whether
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:40.680]   it was Southeast Asia or in Belize or in Portugal, they were saying, you're so lucky it's the
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   land of opportunity.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:50.640]   I remember I was having this conversation with this guy in a village in Dala, Myanmar.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.960]   And he said to me, you know, are the streets paved with gold?
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.760]   And and I thought he was joking.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.440]   And the look in his eyes and and at that time in 2012, Myanmar, which is this country sandwiched
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.320]   by I think it's Bangladesh and Thailand, just opened up.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:17.240]   They had a military junta that had been in control and they closed the country to the
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   world.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.420]   And in 2012, they just started allowing Americans and those who are holding American passports
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.440]   to enter more freely.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.660]   And so I was one of the very few to get there.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.000]   And when people would look at you and and they know you're different and they know that
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.960]   you're coming from the United States, they're just bombarding me with questions about opportunity,
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.200]   about the American dream.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.280]   I mean, not in those contexts, but all around those subject matter.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:57.560]   And here I was thinking to myself, these people believe that we have tremendous opportunity
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:03.080]   in the United States, that people are are able to just quit their jobs and backpack
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.320]   around the world that I did.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:13.760]   And there is a point where all these conversations culminated to to me going to another part
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.400]   of the country in Myanmar called Bagan.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:24.280]   And I and it's a picture that has become really synonymous with my brand and my image.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.720]   I'm sitting on this eighth century temple staring out of five thousand temples, pagodas,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.360]   stupas on the horizon.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.760]   And it was that moment where I said to myself, I'm living my dreams.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.600]   And where was everyone else?
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:47.840]   And through that, that aha moment, I I took that through all the other countries I went
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.720]   through for that year and the other conversations that impacted me.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.000]   And I said, how did this guy who grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, that everything stacked
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.960]   up against him, that had this horrible relationship with money that was doing some of the right
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.320]   things, but not all the right things?
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:14.080]   How did I get from that point to to saying no to the traditional path, to being able
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:21.320]   to say no to a higher paying position, fancier title and just go backpacking around the world
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.600]   without any plans of what's next when I came back?
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.240]   And I realized that was just it was financial knowledge.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.040]   It was.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.600]   And I like to say that knowledge is power, but financial knowledge is life changing.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:45.360]   And being exposed in the banking industry, being exposed to experts, certified financial
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.720]   planners, financial advisors and having conversations with people when that opening up their accounts
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.080]   or on taking their deposits or or what have you in the branch.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.920]   I was having these conversations with people who are handling their money very well and
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.200]   those who are struggling.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.840]   And I could see people driving in with their fancy Mercedes Benz or or Range Rovers.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.720]   And I would look in their bank account when they're making their deposit or opening up
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.040]   their checking account.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.560]   And I'll notice that there were no savings whatsoever or that they paid multiple numbers
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.160]   of of non-sufficient fund fees.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.320]   And and so it was that.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.760]   And so through that process, when I got back in 2013, I wanted to understand what got me
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.120]   from where I was to where I am today.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   And and again, it had a lot to do with just beginning to understand money, beginning to
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.440]   understand my relationship with money and addressing these money beliefs that stemmed
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.520]   from my relationship with money.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:59.440]   You feel a little guilty while traveling, because obviously when you travel extensively,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.600]   you see people who, as you say, they say that the roads are paved with gold in America.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:12.480]   And here you are walking away from from all that to come and to to depending on how I
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.560]   frame the question, to gawk at them or to experience their lifestyle.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.440]   Did you feel a little guilty about walking away?
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.760]   You know, I did.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.320]   And so something that that that I don't share as as often and I probably should.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:37.760]   So when I left in in January, I think it's it was the 11th of 2012 to my first country,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.120]   I went to the Philippines.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.520]   I went to I flew into Manila and the Philippines.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.080]   It's a third world country.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.400]   It's a country that is growing, but it's a third world country.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.720]   And I remember walking around and I'm part Filipino.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:26:01.680]   And and I saw people struggling and they were having, you know, when there is poverty in
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:08.440]   the US, but you haven't seen poverty until you've seen third world poverty and people
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.320]   living in slums or living on top of each other.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:17.800]   They're living by the riverbanks in these shanty like homes.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.880]   And it was really jarring for me.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   And and so I remember I was flying from Manila in the Philippines to another island, Cebu,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.560]   and I went and I bought I purchased my ticket and I'm in the plane and I'm sitting down
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.120]   just staring out through the window.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.320]   And all these thoughts, these emotions are rushing into my body.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   And I've just been away.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.720]   I've been out of the US for two weeks.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.280]   I was holding the handrails right there.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.680]   So I'm holding them really tightly and I have my eyes closed and I'm thinking about, you
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.560]   know, all the all the images, the conversations that I was just having in that short two week
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.000]   time frame in the Philippines.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.080]   And I remember closing my eyes and I was having a nervous breakdown and I go, God, did I make
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.600]   the right decision?
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.840]   And and so at that point, I realized I was like, you know, did I make that right decision?
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:30.760]   And I decided when I landed and I went backpacking in Cebu, I was doing all the normal taking
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.400]   photos and going around being a tourist.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:43.680]   And as I was in Cebu, all of a sudden I see hordes of people running and screaming and
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.080]   I didn't know what was happening.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.960]   And and I took a step back going, oh, my God, this is a riot.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.160]   And, you know, coming from Jersey, coming from the things that I've seen, I'm like,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.940]   OK, this must be a riot.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.720]   And so I stand back and I let these people pass.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.100]   And all of a sudden, motorcycles and cars are zipping, rushing by.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.340]   And I'm there with my camera going, I don't know what's going on until someone stopped
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:12.840]   and said to me and looked at me and said, run tidal wave.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:20.360]   And at that point I go, I start running and I'm looking behind me thinking like, you know,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.420]   all these people that are running behind me, you know, where's the wave coming from?
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.260]   And then I'm in an island, you know.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.120]   So where is this wave and where am I supposed to go to?
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.140]   It was complete mayhem and chaos.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.600]   And at that point, like I switched the camera on and I and I covered kind of the last moments
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.080]   of it where I said, maybe this is it.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.120]   And and then I mean, obviously, I'm safe.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.160]   I'm here talking to you.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.760]   But I was in my hotel room and I would still feel the aftershock.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.080]   So there was an earthquake that happened in a neighboring island.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.800]   And because of what happened in Thailand and Indonesia with the tsunami, the swelling of
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:04.360]   the ocean for a bit caused a panic throughout kind of like the islands in the middle part
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.720]   of the Philippines.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.880]   And so people started text messaging and and saying that there was a tidal wave that was
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   coming.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.320]   And then all of a sudden I had all these images of what that could look like.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.280]   And I thought, OK, well, I left this comfy job.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.240]   I'm having this nervous breakdown because I left a six figure salary and people are
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   struggling.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.840]   And here I am, like exploring without a care in the world.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:34.680]   And then now I'm going to die in a tsunami here in Cebu.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.360]   And everything with everything ended up being being fine.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:47.120]   And I got some some fame because I went and I posted this video on YouTube and the National
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.840]   News saw the video.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.440]   And then all of a sudden they plastered my face on TV.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.900]   And so on the news, people they had American caught in tsunami.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.680]   And so I had my little bout of my five minutes or 15 minutes of fame in the Philippines.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.640]   But it was that moment when I closed my eyes.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.320]   And this was probably after midnight in the hotel room.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.480]   And I remember going, OK, God, I I said I wanted an adventure.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.760]   I didn't want the traditional path.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.240]   And that was quite an answer to to that question.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.860]   And from that point on, I said, I'm going to, you know, throw my plans across.
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.440]   And that's how I ended up, you know, backpacking through through 20 countries in that 12 month
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   time frame.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:42.880]   And allow myself to open up and come to terms with the mindset that I had and the steps
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.680]   that I took to get me from again, from where I was, where I am today.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.000]   So I want to get to the content of your book and what you actually teach.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.400]   So just to summarize, you went on that trip, came back to the US, I guess, took a little
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.200]   bit of time to figure some things out, started working on some of your personal finance projects.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.320]   And then recently you've finished a 50 state tour this past summer of teaching seminars
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   on financial wellness.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.240]   And then you've just recently published the book, You Only Live Once.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.280]   Is that a reasonably correct, concise summary of the last few years since your trip?
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   That's absolutely it.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.400]   That's what has transpired in the last three years.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:24.360]   OK, so you based upon your experience, which you charted out, which in many ways, don't
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.360]   be offended.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.000]   I think it's the perfect stereotypical millennial experience.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.920]   And I want to explore it because we are compatriots in terms of being of similar age.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   How old are you currently, Jason?
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   33.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.640]   OK, so you're two years older than I am.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.920]   But this is kind of the experience that many of our generation faces.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.640]   And this is something that the reason I ask you about if you're guilty and the reason
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:54.280]   I'm asking you some of these probing questions is you and I might understand this, and perhaps
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.220]   many of our younger listeners will.
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.680]   But there are many people who hear this angst that you described, living in California,
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.520]   working, being in line with a CEO, who hear this kind of personal turmoil, angst, and
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.400]   just say, what's wrong with you?
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.040]   Why do you not take advantage of this?
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.840]   You can go visit your family, and you can set up a nice life.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.080]   So I want to explore the emotions of this a little bit and also explore your advice
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   for others.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.280]   So you've spoken with a lot of people all around the world, and you put a lot of research
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.800]   into your book.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:39.120]   What is different about you and our generation that makes you approach money this way as
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:46.520]   compared to perhaps your parents or grandparents who would have been content to say, I've got
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.700]   a great opportunity here at this credit union, I'm going to keep on working and doing good
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.960]   work here?
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:58.360]   I think we are a generation that was raised to believe that anything and everything was
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.360]   possible.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.160]   That if we wanted something, we had to work really hard, and we can achieve it.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   We can achieve our dreams.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.400]   We are the first generation to say, if you have a dream, you can live it.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.000]   You can have it.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.780]   And our parents, the baby boomers, worked really, really hard to enable us to be able
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.980]   to live our dreams.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.520]   And maybe they had to, and I have these conversations with baby boomers, who say, yes, I sacrificed
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   really hard.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.160]   I worked tons of hours.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.880]   I stayed at one or two jobs in my lifetime so I could provide food on the table.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:43.440]   I could make sure that my kids went to college so they can live their dream life.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.600]   And what's really interesting, when you talk about that point of contention, is that, yeah,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.920]   I'll hear some baby boomers saying, yes, you're an entitled generation.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:59.400]   You're a generation that, like you, here you are, Jason.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:05.040]   You graduated and you went to, you had this fancy job, and you're making money, more money
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.400]   than what others would make.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.480]   And you turned it all around and said, forget this.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.680]   I'm going to go backpacking around the world.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.880]   And that really boils down to the values that our parents, my parents, instilled in me.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:28.120]   My parents worked really hard, and they wanted to make sure that I had the opportunity to
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.840]   be able to enjoy life.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.360]   So they spent their time working to give their kids a better life.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.520]   And so that value system, all relating to time.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.840]   And my parents worked all the time.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.880]   And so, and like my brothers and sisters and I, we had to take care of ourselves.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:54.840]   But it really had to do with this value of time, this belief that we can achieve and
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.720]   we can live the life of our dreams sooner rather than later.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.060]   These are things that we were taught by our parents, the baby boomers.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.200]   And so when I hear this point of contention between baby boomers and millennials, Gen
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:15.300]   Y, I like to say that we are the product of our parents' hopes and dreams.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.320]   So our parents had these hopes, they had these dreams, and they instilled them into us.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.200]   And they created us.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:30.640]   And so we are an entitled generation in the sense that we were told that if we go to college,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.600]   we'll get a great job and we'll be able to afford a house and start a family.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:42.320]   And then for many of us, we were raised in what, two, like the internet bust in the early
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.440]   2000s, and then the housing crisis in our formative years after college.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.720]   And so all of a sudden we start saying, wait a minute, like this traditional path that
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   they went on doesn't really align with the values that they taught us.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.000]   And so for many of us, that's how we were stressing and using our hard-earned dollars
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.040]   on experiences than things.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.160]   How does this approach financial planning?
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.040]   How does this change financial planning?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.720]   And let me give a little bit more background to the question.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.540]   You, in your work in the credit union, you had some exposure to traditional financial
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.760]   planning.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:28.640]   And now in your work of You Only Live Once and the work that you've done of laying out
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.320]   how to approach financial planning, you've talked more, you're incorporating some of
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.120]   the more non-traditional aspects.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.760]   And even in your own story, you were putting money into a 401k, but then you quit your
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.800]   job to travel the world.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.040]   So obviously you need money for that.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.880]   Now you're trying to put together this career that's different.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.040]   Now you've put together this career that is different than what it was previously.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.840]   So I find that in the world of financial planning, there's a real disconnect in the ability for,
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:02.760]   say millennials with the life attitude that you just described, and financial advisors
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.440]   who are trained to serve a baby boomer generation.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.980]   I find there's a real disconnect of their ability to communicate with one another.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:17.960]   So how does this type of approach, this You Only Live Once approach affect financial planning?
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:23.320]   How do you incorporate this desire to live now, do it now, while also recognizing the
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.720]   value of saving and investing over a lifetime?
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.400]   So I first, I'm sure as people are listening, and I get this a lot too, it's like, why did
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.120]   I title it You Only Live Once?
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.260]   That comes from our generation's use of YOLO, right?
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.980]   We shortened it up, used the acronym YOLO, and that was associated with mindless spending
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.380]   sprees that was associated with just kind of living for the moment without a care to
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.060]   the future.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:59.020]   And as we get older, so we're no longer 21 and careless, and many of us can still be
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:09.900]   careless in our 30s, we're really understanding the term YOLO as it relates to what it stood
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:15.320]   for, You Only Live Once, and that yes, we can make unwise financial decisions for the
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.640]   moment that can curtail our ability to enjoy future moments.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:27.220]   So You Only Live Once is an understanding, it's awareness that through sound financial
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.940]   decision making, you can have a lifetime of moments that are positive.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:39.700]   So it's not about saying, okay, well, I need to buy that expensive luxury car that I can't
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:44.840]   afford, but YOLO, and then all of a sudden we find ourselves six months later struggling
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:51.400]   to make the car payment or the insurance payment, because to me, that's not living this one
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.780]   lifetime and things like that.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:39:02.100]   So I really wanted to stress that it wasn't about this consumption and this spur of the
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:09.940]   moment decision making, that it's true awareness that you have this one lifetime here on this
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:16.340]   planet, and you have the opportunity to make sound financial decisions that can enable
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.480]   you to enjoy a lifetime.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.620]   And so that has truly resonated.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.060]   It has resonated across generations.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.700]   I mean, I have traditionalists that attend the sessions as well as baby boomers who said,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:35.420]   I wish I knew this 30, 40 years ago, because this aligns with my values today, that there's
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.420]   a balance.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:42.740]   There's a balance of saving for the future and also enjoying some of the things that
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:47.920]   you enjoy, whether it is luxury goods or it is experiences.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:56.760]   And I found that speaking with financial advisors and experts who serve the baby boomer generation,
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.660]   they're still looking at this tried and true method, right?
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:07.340]   This method of, okay, you're buying a home, you need to send these kids to school, you
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.300]   will be retiring at the age of 70.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.500]   So there are all these benchmarks.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:19.820]   And then I see speaking with those who are retired and follow this traditional financial
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:28.660]   planning, they get sick because one, there is no purpose to their life for one, so they
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.560]   become ill and they end up passing a few years after retirement.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.960]   I had one individual share that with me that happened to their spouse.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:45.720]   And so what I've noticed, and there's a growing shift of advisors and CFPs that are catering
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:52.900]   to our generation and generation Z and even generation X, that we can do sound financial
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:59.640]   planning, we can contribute to our retirement at the same time, be able to enjoy the things
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   that, you know, in our lives that make our life worth living, that we can look back and
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   say, yes, that was a great lifetime of moments.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.380]   And it really starts with the vision for life.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.120]   And when I've sat down with traditional financial advisors, they'll talk to me specifically
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.440]   about my financial goals.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:29.760]   And we rarely had a conversation about how those financial goals relate to the vision
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.240]   of the life that I wanted to live.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:38.280]   And I've noticed that I was always pushed to, okay, what's the vision for your retirement?
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:44.940]   So here I am in my 20s being told, how do you envision your retirement?
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.520]   What do you hope to be doing when you're 70, when you're unable to walk or you're having
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.920]   pains and things like that?
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.620]   And I said, this just doesn't resonate.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:01.180]   It's like, how am I supposed to think about something 40, 50 years into the future?
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:07.840]   But that's what all the conversations were being steered at was something down at 70.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.040]   And now I was following this traditional path.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.440]   And when I shared my story, things weren't working out the way that I'd envisioned in
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.120]   some aspects.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.920]   And I realized that's like, okay, there has to be some type of middle ground.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:27.640]   There has to be a way for us to allocate our time and resources on the things that matter,
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:33.560]   on the things that I value today.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.680]   But also to the point where I'm saving for the future.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.120]   And I think of retirement quite differently, and I've noticed, than the majority of people
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:50.800]   that I do meet out on the road, that retirement is the state in which you are physically unable
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   to exchange your time for a paycheck or for money.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.120]   So I meet people who are 70, 80, they're still working, they're still chugging along, and
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.920]   they want to work because, yeah, they get some additional cash and they don't necessarily
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.360]   need to because they have a great nest egg, but they do it for social reasons.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:15.000]   They do it because they want to use their time as opposed to just sitting around.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.260]   And then so I knew that there's that middle ground.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:23.400]   And looking back again, in my experience, looking back on the things that I purchased
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.040]   and how do they represent my values in terms of the time spent here in this world, I realized
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   that I was like, oh, wait, wait a minute.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.680]   I can spend on the things that matter and I can plan for the future to the point where
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:46.360]   if I'm physically unable to exchange my time for a paycheck, that I have enough to pay
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.640]   for my living expenses.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.520]   I have enough to continue to enjoy life.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.000]   And that was again, was like one of that aha moment.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.200]   And I thought I was alone in this.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.000]   And the more that I speak, the more I got into personal finance blogging.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.520]   And that's what I started doing in 2013, just kind of sharing this.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:08.920]   And the community started growing and I started meeting you and others like you that had this
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:14.880]   different idea that we can spend our money on things that we enjoy.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.400]   But we have to be really clear.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:23.800]   We have to understand the value in which they contribute to our life.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:30.880]   And so that moment, that's how I've been living my life in some degree and just more so in
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   the past few years.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.280]   I want to ask you one more question on this mindset.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.640]   I want to transition to actually some of the specifics, things that you've done and the
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.880]   strategies you've employed to make this work for yourself.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:48.760]   As a listener of my show who is very financially knowledgeable, has a young family and has
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:56.400]   money in a retirement account, but in considering the age of their children, they're considering
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.320]   pulling out of the workforce for a year and traveling with their family and their children
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.960]   around the country on an RV trip.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.480]   It was a long held dream, long held goal.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:10.240]   But in order to finance it, they'd need to choose to withdraw money from their 401k early.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.560]   I don't care about the financial cost.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.320]   This listener is very aware of the costs of penalties and taxes, et cetera.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.480]   What I care about is, so I'm not asking you to comment on the advisability of such an
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.480]   action.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   What I care about is the challenge of prioritizing now versus later.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:37.120]   If you were given a scenario like I've just described, how would you advise somebody to
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:44.560]   consider the advisability of pursuing a short term goal versus a long term goal, given that
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.520]   there are costs and benefits to both?
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.520]   Absolutely.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:57.800]   I mean, we can go and do an analysis and I tend to state to people when they're deciding
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:03.360]   whether or not to leave a job, and then for this instance, leave for a year and go cross
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:10.320]   country to outweigh the financial cost, the pros and the cons, to outweigh the experiences
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.400]   and what you hope to.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:19.840]   And I think at this point, there are ways for you to plan the finances for this year,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.800]   as opposed to just kind of going blindly.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.880]   And so for me to kind of give you my strategy and how I left my senior executive job and
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:37.640]   was able to travel for a year without thoughts to finances, and I still had expenses very
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.000]   minimally.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.960]   That was one.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:49.960]   If you have this idea, this thought you want to go away for a year is to start saving to
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.600]   cover the basic living expenses.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.440]   So that is definitely a strategy that does work.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:02.480]   And so it's not about saving tons of money, it's saving the amount that you need just
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.380]   to cover the basics.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:12.040]   And that could be maybe you still have some student loan debt that you need to pay.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:17.880]   Maybe there are some credit card debt that needs to be paid, etc.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.840]   You have your cell phone bill.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.420]   So you need to know and calculate how much those things are and be able to project, okay,
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.540]   this is the amount that I need in order for me to cover whatever those basic living expenses
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.700]   are.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.120]   So housing, food, etc.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:40.040]   And the wonderful thing about that, it's not about, you're not looking at income, you're
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.840]   looking at expenses.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.420]   And so you have the ability to start cutting things that are eating at your income or your
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:54.360]   ability to put money into an account that you can use for the entire year.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.600]   And so for me, I looked at, I was saving for a down payment in a home.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:04.880]   And then when I realized I wanted to go backpacking around the world instead, I used the money
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:10.040]   that I was saving for this down payment on a home and I paid off the rest of my debt.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.800]   I mean, I was still carrying student loan debt.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.600]   I had a bit of credit card debt.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:20.040]   And so I used that down payment to pay off the rest of that debt.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.360]   And I looked at my expenses.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.960]   At that point, I let go of, you know, I didn't have my apartment.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:30.280]   I sold a majority of my things, I think 99% of my things, the cars.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:37.000]   And so I had the most minimal expenses that you could have on a monthly basis.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   And that allowed me to backpack around the world for an entire year at $10,000.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:50.800]   And so I look at this as you don't want to stress yourself with leaving the workforce,
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:57.080]   going on this cross country adventure, and then coming back and going, "What the heck
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.320]   did I just do?"
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.980]   Now I'm stressed because you're not going to look back.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:09.640]   And I think of success as the ability to look back in time through whatever you've gone
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   through and say, "Today, I am happy.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.720]   I am content.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.160]   I'm in a good place today," regardless of the things that happened.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.760]   And now if you're coming back from this cross country trip and you've placed yourself in
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:28.280]   a financial situation, all this uncertainty, this debt, you're not going to be able to
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.240]   look at the experience fondly.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:37.000]   You're not going to be able to have the experiences that you want.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.100]   And so I really encourage people to think about the various options that they have before
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.960]   leaving a job and then going out traveling the world if the company offers a sabbatical.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.880]   If not and you do decide to leave, you do some planning.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.520]   And that kind of goes back to financial wellness.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.000]   It's the vision, getting clarity of your values, and financial planning.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.940]   That's a really key component, making sure that those expenses are paid up.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:06.940]   But that's one way.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.680]   So there are some traditional aspects to kind of doing the non-traditional path.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:20.160]   And again, all aimed at being able to enjoy your short-term goals at the same time, not
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.600]   fearing what the future has in store.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:27.440]   Jason, you left the job that had a lot of career promise.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.440]   How do you support yourself financially now since coming back from your trip?
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.880]   So as I mentioned, I did some wise financial decision making.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.340]   I'd always contributed.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.240]   And so let me take a step back.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.680]   When I was younger, when I was 21 and I joined the workforce, someone sat me down.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.380]   She was a financial advisor.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:54.800]   And she said, Jason, whatever you do, just keep contributing 10% into your 401(k) because
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   I don't care.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.260]   And she says, I don't care what you do with your money.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.260]   Just do that.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:05.300]   And then for some reason, it was the first financial advice that I ever got from at that
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:11.020]   point someone that I knew was an expert and had all these certifications and licenses.
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:18.820]   And so I followed that and I contributed 10% of my 401(k) and then I dabbled in the stock
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:23.660]   market and just kind of playing around saying, OK, well, that's interesting.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:33.580]   And so I do have investments that I've held on to through the years that are paying off.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.900]   And in addition, I am a freelance writer.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.260]   So there are moments where I get an opportunity to write.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:50.060]   I've also become a consultant and I address millennial issues in the workplace and also
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:56.620]   how to speak our language, specifically with fintech companies or financial technology
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.980]   companies, financial services such as credit unions and community banks.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:06.660]   Like how do you talk to us in a way that you know you understand our value system, you
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:13.380]   understand how we do prioritize experience over things and how we want to live for the
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:17.820]   moment but also plan for the future and how we don't want to be sold products and we want
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:24.020]   to be aligned with brands that understand, again, our values.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:29.020]   And so that's how I'm able to support myself through some blogging, through some consultations
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.780]   and speaking gigs across the country.
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:36.580]   Have you ever wondered if you made the right decision?
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.020]   I can tell you right now, as I mentioned, success is looking back and saying, wow, through
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.660]   all that stuff, I'm content.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:49.540]   And there hasn't been a moment in the past three years that I've questioned my decision
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.180]   in leaving.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:55.500]   And that's because it has been a roller coaster ride.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:03.260]   And I've realized at this point when we when we incorporate sound financial decision making
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:12.700]   with a very clear focus and purpose, I don't have time to go, wow, maybe I should be back
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.700]   in corporate.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:19.060]   But I do want to say I went back to during my road trip across the country where we drove
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:23.420]   18000 miles and had 54 events.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:28.460]   I was back in the Bay Area in San Francisco and I had three events all across the Bay.
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:34.180]   And I remember I was in San Jose, California, and I wanted to check the the condo that I
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.460]   wanted to purchase back then in 2011.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:42.740]   It was a two bedroom condo at these towers at the new building in downtown San Jose.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.100]   And it was going for four hundred thousand dollars back in 2011.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.100]   Right.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:53.340]   And so I went and I look at what the two bedroom condos going for close to one point
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.380]   to five million dollars.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:03.660]   So when you're talking about thinking, thinking about, well, maybe did I make the right decision
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.660]   at that point?
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.380]   I just laugh because in a very short period of time, you're looking at that the value
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   of that condo.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:15.940]   If I had purchased it back in 2011 would be three times as much then.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:20.140]   But again, at that point, I wouldn't have had this clarity of thought.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:25.820]   I wouldn't have been clear in terms of money mindset and I wouldn't have been able to truly
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:31.140]   understand my relationship with money, to craft a life of financial well-being and a
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.740]   purposeful one.
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:39.660]   Final question is always would you even have sold at that point in time because or would
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.580]   you have would you have jumped ship?
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.180]   It is definitely a matter of intelligent timing, but sometimes it's easier to jump a little
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:51.060]   early than a little bit late because you're less you're less committed.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:56.980]   I know when I left when I left my and closed my financial planning business to pursue radical
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.920]   personal finance, there were many factors involved.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.660]   But one that I did seriously consider was the fact that although it was a very expensive
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:09.340]   decision for me to leave, I walked away from a lot of of future income that I had already
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:13.340]   earned in various deferred compensation arrangements.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:19.420]   But I looked at it and said, "If it's this hard now, in five years when the numbers are
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.940]   triple, it's going to be a lot harder.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.780]   And will I really walk away at that point in the future?"
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:29.300]   Now I think anybody, if you count the cost and you decide that you want to make a change,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.120]   you'll make a change no matter what.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.980]   But golden handcuffs are very real and you get used to certain things.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:41.540]   And so I think it's worth factoring that in to your decision criteria.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.180]   Last question I want to bring to you Jason here is you just finished this trip that you
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:50.700]   briefly said, 18,000 miles, 54 stops doing financial wellness seminars.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.740]   How long were you on the road for that trip?
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.920]   A hundred and seven days.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.740]   So what's interesting to me about this is it's a good way of showing how when you have
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:06.260]   an area of interest and an area of focus, you can incorporate work and fun.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.260]   So you had a 107 day road trip.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:12.740]   I'm sure a lot of parts of it were difficult and were work, but it was also fun, wasn't
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.740]   it?
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.740]   Absolutely.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:23.020]   I got to hike, I got to explore, and I got to eat at really fancy places that you'd see
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.620]   on TV.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.740]   And so it was a lot of fun.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:32.060]   And exactly what you said, I'm at the stage in my life where I'm very fortunate through
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:37.180]   a lot of hard work and timing and new networks and connections that I'm able to incorporate
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.940]   the things that I enjoy.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.020]   So I'm passionate about personal finance.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.820]   I'm passionate about helping others.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:48.220]   I'm passionate and love traveling and having new experiences.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.740]   That's what I wanted to do when I decided to leave corporate and start backpacking around
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:52.740]   the world.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.780]   And here I am.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:59.620]   And I look at myself and I'm in the mirror and I say, "Jason, is this real life?"
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:06.540]   Because I now have this opportunity to incorporate all these things that I enjoy into something
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:11.180]   that generates income and serves my purpose.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:15.060]   So how did you, what were the financial arrangements for a trip like this?
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.500]   I assume you had a couple sponsors and you were doing some work with a client and then
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.700]   also, I think it tied in with your book.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.700]   But my impression is that you made money on this road trip.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.020]   Is that right?
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.340]   Correct.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:35.020]   So I had sponsors who purchased copies of the books and also sponsors who paid me to
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:41.220]   go speak in front of an audience to share the exact parts of the story that I just shared
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:44.900]   with your listeners.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:52.020]   And so the majority of my sponsors throughout the country were credit unions.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.540]   And I also work with USAA.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.700]   They sponsored three of my stops.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:02.820]   But you're looking at 30 stops across the country were sponsored by local credit unions.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:07.060]   And also work with some FinTech folks and nonprofit organizations and city organizations,
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.020]   all excited about trying to figure out what makes us tick?
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.260]   Why are we so focused on experiences and not just things?
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:16.900]   And what is this YOLO mentality all about?
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:24.260]   So yeah, the generosity of sponsors that align with my vision as well as the mission of the
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.060]   road trip helped make this possible.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.260]   And part of that too was to ensure that the cost was covered.
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:37.280]   It's a really expensive endeavor to spend 107 days on the road as well as host events.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.380]   So not only did we just show up in a couple of places, we hosted events, we found the
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:42.380]   venue.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:46.180]   We did the food and things like that.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:53.220]   But also at the point to knowing that what was the value with the time that we spent
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:59.940]   on the road as well as the potential for profit to continue the conversation going forward.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:05.700]   It is just a cool example though of how many things can be done where when you get free
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:11.940]   of some constraints, you can substitute ways to earn income and do something that you care
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:17.940]   about and there are plenty of ways in today's world to integrate this with sponsors, etc.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:18.940]   and really make it happen.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.780]   Jason, thanks for coming on and sharing your story.
