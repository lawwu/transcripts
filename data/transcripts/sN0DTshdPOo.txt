[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - What about mouth taping?
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.400]   - I can be such a fan of mouth taping,
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.920]   but I think here are the caveats,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.400]   and this is why a lot of the sleep community
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.480]   is upset about it,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.200]   is that many people are just mouth taping
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.960]   and not taking the steps to get tested
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.000]   to make sure there's no respiratory-based disturbances
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120]   at play, because if you are,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   you truly are just band-aiding the problem
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.080]   to the point that it can actually make it worse
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.440]   in some cases.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.040]   If you do have sleep apnea, upper air resistance syndrome,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.960]   some of the snoring,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   but that's not to say that one,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.760]   if we clear that out, make sure that's not present
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   and you're good to go,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.320]   then that you couldn't benefit from mouth taping.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.800]   And it's also not to say that then if we discover
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.280]   you have one of these disorders,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.120]   then can we use mouth tape to help
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.720]   with the treatment process,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.800]   that you're also being treated for this
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.160]   and using mouth tape,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.880]   you can absolutely do that as well.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.920]   There's just a concern,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   'cause some people are now just blindly
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.280]   taking these steps without knowing
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.040]   that they might be doing some harm.
