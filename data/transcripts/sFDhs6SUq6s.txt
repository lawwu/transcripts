[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   As we talked about yesterday,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.040]   we are gearing up for our 12th
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.480]   and final national conference here in Minneapolis.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.920]   It begins on Friday.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.400]   Related to the theme of the conference,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.040]   we have questions here that I wanna post to you, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.240]   And here's the next one.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.400]   Rather directly put, "Pastor John,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.500]   "I rely on my pastor to study the Bible
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.040]   "and tell me what it says.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.640]   "I don't feel like I need to read the Bible
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.040]   "because I'm listening to his preaching every week."
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.140]   So what would you say to a person who believes
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.420]   the Sunday sermon is enough Bible intake for their week?
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.280]   (laughing)
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.480]   - Well, I was a pastor and I love it when people listen.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.560]   I love it when people trust their pastors
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.760]   and when they're excited to hear him
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.260]   explain the Bible each week.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.800]   Amen, amen, that's wonderful.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.120]   But something's wrong here.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.560]   I mean, this is serious.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.520]   Something's wrong here if the word of God
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.960]   is coming with power.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.520]   Each week, it doesn't just satisfy hunger,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880]   it creates hunger.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.560]   I would have felt like a total failure
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.140]   if my people said, "Because of your preaching,
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.880]   "we don't read our Bibles."
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.000]   Like, what?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640]   What have I done?
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.640]   I've given you food that is so uninteresting or boring
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.680]   or not having any portent or hope
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.600]   that you don't even pick it up during the week.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   So I'm really puzzled what the mindset of this person is
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.720]   to say, "This sermon is all I need."
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   My question would be this, is it all you want?
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.120]   Why isn't the meal on Sunday
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.900]   wetting your taste for more on Monday?
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.520]   Why not?
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.160]   Seems to me like we have two issues here.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.960]   One is, how much of the Bible do we need?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   And the other is, how much of the Bible do we want?
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.540]   So let's take the want question.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540]   Why would you only want one passage a week from the Bible?
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.120]   Why would you want that one and only passage a week
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.920]   to come through another person?
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.260]   To me, that's like saying, "I'm in love.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.140]   "My sweetheart writes me every day,
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.140]   "and I would like to just read her letters once a week,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.460]   "and I think I'd like somebody else to read them for me
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.360]   "and give me a digest of what she said."
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.280]   You kidding me?
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.720]   I was in love one time, summer of '67,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   working as a water safety instructor.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.880]   I smelled the envelopes for five minutes before I opened 'em.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   I'm not gonna give 'em to anybody else.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.860]   And so I'm very eager to go off every day
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.940]   with these lavender envelopes
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.960]   and smell the hands of my future wife.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   To only want to read one love letter a week
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.400]   when she's writing them every day
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.580]   is a sign that something is wrong.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.280]   That's weird.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.560]   Something's wrong with this person's relationship with God.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.400]   Paul says that he lives for Jesus,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.600]   who loved him and gave himself for him.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.640]   Galatians 2:20, that's true.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.120]   Jesus loved us so much that he gave his life for us.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.480]   God loves us so much that he gave his son for us.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.760]   And the Bible is the word of this Jesus who loves us
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.480]   and this Father who loves us
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.640]   about how they relate to us
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.080]   and what they are doing in the world.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.060]   The whole Bible is an unparalleled love letter
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.120]   to the people of God.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.560]   So the psalmist says, "How sweet are your words to my taste,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.200]   "sweeter than honey to my mouth."
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.240]   It just wouldn't make any sense for the psalmist to say,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.000]   "I get a spoonful of honey on Sunday and that's plenty.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.740]   "Don't want any on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.240]   "or Thursday or Friday or Saturday."
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.780]   Instead he said, "My delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.180]   "and on his law I meditate day and night.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.200]   "More to be desired are they than gold,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.240]   "even much fine gold.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.320]   "If you seek them like silver and search for them
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.420]   "as for hidden treasures,
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.520]   "then you will understand the fear of the Lord
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.960]   "and find the knowledge of God."
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.560]   So I would ask our listener, bless his or her heart,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   why would you only want one glimpse a week of this beauty?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.440]   One taste a week of this honey?
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.120]   One deposit a week of this silver in your bank?
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.160]   One letter from your lover?
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.520]   What is going on?
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   Wake up, come on, wake up to reality.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.100]   And then I would shift and ask, what do you need?
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.780]   Is one meal a week all you need?
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.000]   Not just what do you want, but what do you need?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.380]   Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone,
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.500]   "but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God."
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.340]   Every one of them.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.780]   That's how you live, that's how you live.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.140]   You need to eat.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.820]   I think I can say from experience, Tony,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.220]   and from history, and from the Bible,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.220]   every Christian needs more Bible, more spiritual food,
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.140]   than one meal a week.
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.820]   That doesn't work, physically or spiritually.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.000]   Temptations are too relentless.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.140]   Doubt is too frequent.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.440]   Satan is too active.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.580]   Tribulations are too heavy.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.540]   Conflicts are too many.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.420]   Emotions are too volatile.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.740]   Perplexities are too difficult.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.500]   Faith, hope, and love are too threatened
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.580]   to think I can deal with these all week long,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.160]   simply from one word I got on Sunday.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   I can't do it, and I don't think anybody can.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.900]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.140]   And this Friday begins our 2014 National Conference
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.820]   here in Minneapolis at the Convention Center downtown.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.900]   It's titled, "Look at the Book,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.220]   "Reading the Bible for Yourself."
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.100]   It will be our 12th and final national conference,
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.500]   and I know a lot of you will be in town for it.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.380]   You can also tune into the livestream
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.780]   at desiringgod.org/live.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.180]   That page will have a schedule of events.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.260]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:39.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
