[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   How do you generally think about this as someone who probably advocates for stock investing more
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.160]   than the average person? A lot of people talking about personal finance advocate for just index
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160]   funds. But how do you think about concentration and diversification in that way?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.040]   My personal rule of thumb that I use for my portfolio is 15%. I would not be comfortable
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.480]   having more than 15% of my net worth into an individual stock. But I will throw out the caveat
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.840]   there that the way that I personally invest is I am a long-term buy and hold investor. So for a
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.920]   company to become 15% of my portfolio, it would have had to earn its way in there. I would never
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.680]   put 15% from the get-go. I would probably stick to under 5% of my capital. And then if it just so
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.960]   happened to triple from there and become 15%, I would be personally comfortable with doing that.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.320]   My personal, I call this my sleep well at night number, is 15%, but it's different for everybody.
