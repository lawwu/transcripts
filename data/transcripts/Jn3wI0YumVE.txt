[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   The whole earth is full of glory and we find ourselves surrounded by glory in every direction.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.320]   But not every glory is saving glory.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.640]   As John Piper explained in a sermon in Houston back in April of this year, he was talking
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.280]   about his new book, A Peculiar Glory, and what makes saving faith so unique.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.000]   Here's a clip of what he said.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.320]   The reason I called it A Peculiar Glory, that's the title of the book, A Peculiar Glory is
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:45.360]   because I'm not interested in generic glory, like a three pointer buzzer beater to win
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   the tournament.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360]   Like, that's glorious.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.860]   It doesn't save anybody.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.960]   It doesn't make anybody know something glorious, but it's pretty amazing.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   And we come out of our couches.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.720]   If you can get out of your couch.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.160]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.200]   I'm talking about a peculiar glory.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:22.420]   What I mean is a inexplicable, inimitable, unparalleled coming together of diverse excellencies,
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:31.700]   that's Edward's phrase, diverse excellencies like majesty and meekness in Jesus.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.380]   Though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.300]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant and being born in the likeness of
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.100]   men and being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient, even unto death,
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.340]   even the death on the most horrible, horrible, tortured, shaming thing from God to shame.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.220]   That's amazing.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.340]   That is true.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.300]   I will stake my life on it.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.500]   That man is true.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.020]   Even if you say, "Oh, they made it up."
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.700]   No, they didn't make that up.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.220]   It's woven into the fabric of the Bible.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.740]   It's woven into the fabric of my heart.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.660]   It's woven into the fabric of the world that that kind of peculiar glory that he dwells
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.620]   in the high and holy place and with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.780]   There is no God like our God.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.340]   In fact, that's exactly the way Isaiah argues, isn't it?
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.060]   Who has seen a God like you?
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.060]   Now that rhetorical question, who has seen a God like you, means nobody.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.200]   Okay, you got that?
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.620]   Nobody has seen a God like you.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.820]   Go to the Hindus.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.060]   Go to the Muslims.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.420]   Go to Jews who don't believe in Jesus.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.620]   Go to all the religions of the world.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.220]   Who has seen a God like you?
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.580]   Who, you know what comes next, works for those who wait for him.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.560]   All the gods make you work for them.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.140]   God works for you.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:28.020]   Out of his height, out of his infinite, glorious, holy, unimpeachable height, he comes and dies
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.140]   and saves and pours out his spirit to carry you and help you.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.580]   He works for those who wait for him.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.820]   There is no God like this God.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.700]   There's no glory like this glory.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.380]   If God gives you eyes here, these eyes, and you read the Bible cover to cover over and
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:56.220]   over again, you will see the peculiar glory of God woven into this book such that you
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.220]   will know this book is God's book.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.220]   Amen.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.260]   This short clip was taken from John Pepper's message on April 28th of this year titled
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.940]   God's Peculiar Glory, How We Know the Bible is True.
