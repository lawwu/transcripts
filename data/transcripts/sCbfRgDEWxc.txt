[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420]   Well, it's hard to believe that it's been a month since my book, Slow Productivity,
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.000]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout was published.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.460]   And one of the advantages of it having been a month is that I have in those weeks, intervening
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.080]   weeks done a lot of interviews about this book, which means I have some data.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.540]   In particular, I have some data about what ideas from this book seem to be catching people's
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.860]   attention.
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.500]   So what I want to do today is isolate what I think is the single most discussed suggestion
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.880]   from this book based on what interviewers want to talk to me about.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.960]   It is a suggestion, a strategic suggestion that promises essentially right away to significantly
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.140]   reduce the sense that you're frantic and busy all the time, running on a treadmill of digital
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.820]   freneticism and yet getting very little actual accomplished during the workday.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.060]   It's a solution that overnight can make that problem significantly reduced in your life.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.060]   So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.000]   I'm going to look a little closer at this problem of digital busyness and get to the
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800]   core of it.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.200]   Why are we like this?
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.240]   Then I will give you the big suggestion from my book that's been discussed more than any
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960]   other idea so far during my publicity tour.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.200]   And then I will talk about tactical suggestions for how to implement this idea in your actual
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200]   work life.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.520]   I'm going to break this into two parts.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.460]   Tactical suggestions for implementing it as an individual, even if you have demanding
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.480]   bosses and clients who aren't on board and tactical suggestions for implementing this
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.160]   if you're a team, you can get even extra power if a team works together all on the same page.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.040]   All right, let's get into it.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   All right.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.280]   So what's the problem that we're going to face here?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720]   This idea that you're frantic all day long, jumping from email to slack in and out of
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.920]   meetings all day, exhausted and yet feeling like very little is actually being accomplished
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   on the projects that you need to do, that you're as busy as you've ever been.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.560]   And yet progress on your work has never been slower.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.080]   Now, if we're going to solve this, we need to know why this problem has become worse.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.640]   Now, as longtime listeners of this show know, I'm a technologist, I'm a computer science
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.080]   professor, I try to understand these issues through the lens of technology interacting
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.120]   with us, our society and cultures in unexpected ways.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.680]   And I think this is almost entirely an issue of a techno-human interaction.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   All right.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.240]   So two things happened, both coincident with what I call the front office IT revolution,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.480]   the arrival in the nineties of personal computers on the desk of knowledge workers, followed
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   in the 2000s by networks and then wireless networks and mobile computing.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.040]   So the front office IT revolution, two things came along with this that created the sense
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.440]   of frantic busyness in which very little was getting done.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.480]   One, I think this is probably the least reported.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   It ended specialization.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.000]   Let me be a little bit more clear about this.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.320]   We've forgotten about this because we're so used to it, but it's very important.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.120]   Pre-front office IT revolution, work tasks were more specialized.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.520]   There was enough custom knowledge and tools and friction involved in doing most things
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.040]   in the office that we tended to specialize.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.360]   Different support staff would work on different things.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.520]   If you were an executive knowledge worker, you would be thinking more about strategy,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.620]   for example, but you didn't type things and you weren't able to make flight reservations.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.440]   And certainly you couldn't put together slides for a presentation.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.160]   You need a graphic department to do that.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.880]   There was all sorts of different people that work together.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   Things were more specialized.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.720]   Then the personal computer came along and he said, look, this is going to be a productivity
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   miracle.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.360]   And they were right in the very narrow sense that the personal computer took many of these
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.080]   things that were happening in the office and made them more efficient to do.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.880]   Typing is much easier on a word processor.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.020]   Now really anyone can do it.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.980]   You can fix mistakes.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.020]   It's not you, when you're typing onto a typewriter paper, you really need to be good at typing.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.440]   Otherwise you're going to be constantly whiting things out, compute.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.680]   You could fix your mistakes on it.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.400]   You could format things yourself.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.840]   You can build slides.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.080]   You can do your own presentations.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.680]   You can send your own communications.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.160]   You can, you don't need voicemail.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   You don't need a secretary.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.840]   You can send emails and wait for those emails to come in.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.120]   We get intra-office intranets where now I can log time sheets and book travel and fill
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.520]   out compliance forms.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.820]   It made lots of things doable by everybody.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.560]   So what happened with this revolution?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.640]   We fired all the support staff and said, who's left?
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.400]   Just do everything now.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.080]   So the amount of work possible for each individual left in knowledge work after the front office
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   revolution skyrocketed.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.720]   The sheer diversity of different things you might do during your days compared to like
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.680]   the Mad Men days of the 1960s to 2006 is vast, vastly increased.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   All right.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.520]   The second thing that happened coincident with the front office IT revolution is digital
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.040]   networking reduced the friction of trying to assign some of this work to someone else.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.000]   So now there's a vastly larger pool of things people can be doing.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.360]   It's no longer, hey, Don Draper, go build this ad campaign for Kodak and let us know
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   when you're done.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.520]   Let's build this infinitely many smaller types of things we can ask people to do.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.800]   Digital networks reduced the friction of actually assigning work.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.840]   There is no social capital cost or minimal social capital costs when I'm just writing
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.480]   abstractly into a screen.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.440]   Hey, Don, can you throw together some numbers for the Q2 report?
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   Send.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.800]   I don't have to see your face.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.840]   I don't have to see this as a transaction in which I'm asking for a valuable resource
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   of you.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   I don't see this as a favor.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   It's an abstraction.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   Send.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   Boom.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   It's also much easier, right?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.560]   As soon as I think of something, I could get it off my plate.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.840]   I can play obligation hot potato by just type, type, type, type, type, send, and I don't
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.280]   have to worry about it.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.440]   In a pre-digital network era, it might be a while till I see you again.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.640]   Maybe we have a meeting scheduled tomorrow.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.120]   So I need some way of keeping track of what's on my plate and what needs to be done.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   And once I'm more organized about things, I might actually start consolidating things
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.440]   and taking things off my plate or being smarter about how we organize our efforts.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.120]   But in the digital network age, I don't have to do any of that because as soon as something
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.400]   appears into my cognitive world and becomes causing stress, I can get that hot potato
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.600]   out of my hands in seven seconds of typing.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.720]   And so we became less organized, less considered about tasks, and just started throwing them
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   off left and right.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.120]   So we put these two things together.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.700]   The amount of possible work for a knowledge worker to do increased.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.280]   The amount of possible work that was on the knowledge worker's plate increased.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.160]   We got overloaded.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.800]   This then created, so this is not directly the problem we talked about, which is busyness,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   but it created that problem.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.640]   And it created that problem because, of course, the reality of anything that you have committed
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.800]   to do, a project, a task, whatever size it is, is that it brings with it its own administrative
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   overhead.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.920]   You have to talk about it, you have to collaborate about it, you have to gather materials for
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   it.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   And in the age of the front office IT revolution, this administrative overhead became more disruptive
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.000]   and time-fracturing than ever before because it could be sending emails back and forth
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   throughout the day.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.400]   This was one of the most attention-fracturing possible means of collaboration.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.600]   Asynchronous back-and-forth conversations that require you to constantly be checking
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.800]   channels and inboxes so that you see the next message in time to reply.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.320]   We also had the digital meeting revolution.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.520]   It's never been easier to throw a meeting on people's calendars, to throw around invites.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.840]   The cost of setting up meetings really reduced.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.080]   So now we're paying this administrative overhead on more things than ever before, and the impact
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.320]   of this administrative overhead is more invasive and intrusive than ever before.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.080]   This is what has caused our current problem with frenetic busyness.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.040]   Why we feel like we're answering messages and in meetings all day but getting very little
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.400]   done is because we have too many things on our plate, and each of these things is generating
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.640]   its own stream of time disruption that takes our time and attention but doesn't actually
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.040]   allow us to complete the thing.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.600]   It's just talking about the thing, and we end up with days totalized by collaboration
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.380]   and overhead with very little time left to actually accomplish work.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.380]   We have to do it in the mornings.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.820]   We have to do it in the late evenings.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.280]   This is not just inefficient, as I like to say during my interviews for slow productivity.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.140]   It's downright deranging.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.920]   So digital front office IT revolution causes the problem.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   What is my idea?
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.740]   What is the idea that comes up more often than any other when we talk about this book
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.680]   on podcasts and radio interviews for solving this problem?
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.400]   Well, now that we understand it, we know what the solutions will be.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.520]   How do you solve busyness?
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   You don't, as many people suggest, try to go after the symptoms and say, "We're going
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:08.240]   to have rules to try to put moats around, protect us from the busyness and this administrative
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.000]   overhead."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.960]   Better expectations on email.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.120]   Don't expect a reply right away, so that way you can batch your emails.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.440]   No meetings on a certain day of the week, and that way you can have a day free of the
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   meetings.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   You have an instinct to treat the symptoms, but this doesn't work because this administrative
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.520]   overhead is actually needed.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.640]   You've agreed to these projects.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.960]   This is how these projects make progress, and if you're not able to be involved in the
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.120]   conversations and have the meetings and the emails, things stall, and it's a problem.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.040]   So these type of treating the symptoms approaches don't work.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.760]   We need to treat the actual underlying problem, and here there's no shortcut to the solution
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.860]   of reducing the number of things creating administrative overhead.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.540]   That is how you solve the problem of frantic deranging busyness.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.220]   Have less things generating administrative overhead.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.680]   It's less about taming the administrative overhead generated by a single project than
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.120]   it is having fewer projects generating the overhead itself.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.560]   Hey there, I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book, Slow Productivity,
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.060]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're really going to like
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.460]   this book.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:23.840]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step instructions for
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.000]   putting it into action.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.060]   So to find out more about the book, check out calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.760]   Everything you need, you can find there.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   All right, thanks.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   Let's get back to it.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.960]   Now, of course, the radical way to do this would just say, like, I work on two things.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   That's it.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.900]   And just say no to everything else.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.800]   The problem is very few of us can do that.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.560]   You have to be very high up or very autonomous in your work.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   You know, I'm a novelist.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.340]   No, I'm just writing my next novel.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.760]   Get out of my face.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   They can do that.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   Almost no one else can.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.520]   So this brings me back to the idea then.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.560]   So what is my strategy if the solution is going to be reducing the number of things
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.320]   generating administrative overhead, but we can't just say no to most things?
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.240]   What is the slow productivity solution that could actually work?
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.520]   All right, here it is.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.340]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.960]   You have two statuses for work that you've agreed to.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.920]   So let's just imagine a list of things you've said yes to.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.760]   There's two statuses, active, waiting.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.560]   The projects labeled active, you're actively working on.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.260]   They can happily generate administrative overhead and you will pay that administrative overhead.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.600]   People can send you emails about it.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.080]   You can set up standing meetings to talk about it.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.880]   You're actively working on it.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:46.200]   Everything else, the projects that are labeled waiting, do not generate administrative overhead.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.840]   They are waiting for their turn in your active spot.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.640]   And as soon as you finish a project that you're actively working on, you pull something new
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.560]   from that waiting list into your collection of active projects and now we can talk about
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.320]   it.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.760]   But if it's in the waiting thing, no, we're not working on those yet.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.420]   These are over here.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.840]   We're waiting for it to come.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.080]   Now for this to work, you have to be very clear about this, right?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.240]   So as we get into the details of how to implement this two status workload management system,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.200]   it doesn't work unless everyone knows what you're up to.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.240]   So you have to be super transparent.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.320]   Here are my list.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.440]   Here's how I work.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.680]   Here is your thing.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680]   It's here.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.880]   It's in position six on the waiting list.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.440]   You can watch it.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.660]   You have to have extreme clarity for the people involved so they know when to start doing
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.000]   administrative overhead with you.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.800]   And more importantly, you've assured them, I have not forgotten about your thing.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.680]   Your thing is on this list and you can check as much as you want and watch it march towards
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.840]   active and when it gets to active, I'm going to execute it.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   You don't have to worry.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   This has been forgotten.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.160]   And that's, what's going to be important here.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.240]   That clarity is going to solve the problem that they really have, which is, I don't want
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.800]   to have to worry about this task.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.560]   All right.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.440]   So this is what we're going to need.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.080]   True statuses, clarity for everyone involved about the status of what you're doing.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.600]   This can make a huge difference essentially right away.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Think about why, right?
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.200]   I mean, if you take the amount of administrative overhead you're paying from, let's say, ten
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.880]   projects and collapse it to three, that's a factor of three or greater decrease in the
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.520]   amount of emails you have to send and meetings you have to attend, a factor of three or greater
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.080]   increase in the amount of time you have to actually work on projects.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.680]   Now you can start getting things done fast.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.640]   You can do them at a high level of quality.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.280]   You're accomplishing more than you ever have before, but it's going to feel much better.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.280]   All right.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.800]   So how do we actually implement this?
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.520]   Well, let's start about talking about how we might do this as an individual, just doing
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   this on your own.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   All right.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.160]   As I talked about first, there has to be clarity.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.680]   So you need a shared document or Trello board or whatever tool you want to use that is shared.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.440]   So you can point people right away.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   Okay.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.280]   This is where your project is.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.080]   Watch it march up to queue.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.020]   So what I like about using a Trello board for this is you can have a Trello column for
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:08.000]   actively working on, and you have a Trello column for queue of projects I'm waiting to
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   execute.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.600]   And this is an ordered queue.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.240]   The thing at the top is the next thing you're going to pull in when you finish an active
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.440]   project and the thing behind right below it, that's the thing after that you're going to
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.440]   pull it.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.760]   So this is an actual ordered queue.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.580]   Then you can have a column for a back burner, right?
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.740]   And what this is for is like a boss or a peer is like, "Hey, we should really think about
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.820]   doing blah."
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.220]   And you know, we're not really ready to work on blah.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.340]   And they don't really want you yet to do it.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.300]   They just sort of had the idea and you need to give them the respect if I'm taking it
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   seriously.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.740]   So you need a place to put that, but that's not a queue that things are being pulled off
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.740]   of.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.580]   It's just a stake in the ground, as David Allen would say.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.180]   You could do this with a shared document too, just three headings.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.240]   Why I like Trello is you can flip those digital cards over and add information to it and attach
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.180]   files to it.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:02.660]   So now you have a place because it's all shared for whoever assigned you this work.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.620]   You can add the stuff they send you about it.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.980]   You can add it to that card.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.300]   They can go directly and add stuff to that card as well as they think up like, "Hey,
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.540]   I want you to remember this or when we get to this, let's not forget this."
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.700]   You have a place for that to go.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.820]   And I have to emphasize this.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.860]   This is like the key point I have to emphasize about the interpersonal dynamics of this suggestion
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.940]   I'm talking about.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.880]   You have to know what game you're playing when you're working at one of these knowledge
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.760]   work jobs.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.840]   The game you're playing, like what it is that your colleagues and bosses wants from you.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.920]   It's not what they want is fast email responses.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.000]   That's not the game you're playing.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.640]   That's not the problem you're solving for them.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.800]   Their problem is not how do I get responses to my emails right away?
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.300]   How do I get people in the meetings as soon as possible?
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.800]   That's not the actual problem they have.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   The problem you can solve for them is, "I have this thing that it needs to get done.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.440]   I can't do it myself and I don't want to be stressed about it.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.960]   I want this off my plate in a way that I can trust it's going to be taken care of."
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.280]   That's the problem you're solving for other people.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.280]   So when they can see, "Here it is, it's in Cal's column and it's in position three,"
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.760]   you're solving that problem for them.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.440]   More importantly, when they think of something else, "Hey, remember this thing we're going
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   to do?
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.920]   I just have three more examples.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.080]   I asked you to update the website with client testimonials," you put it in your queue of
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   things that are waiting.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   "Oh, you know what?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.600]   I just got a testimonial from another client.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.400]   We should make sure we put this in here," or, "Here's another idea I had."
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.200]   When you're using something like a Trello card, you can receive that information and
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.920]   say, "Great, I've just added it to the card," and they can see all this stuff is being attached
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.680]   to this card, the files, the text, the links, and here's the information.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.920]   It's all building up here, and this project is moving up this queue of things that Cal's
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.320]   going to work on next, and all the information is there.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.240]   You're solving the problem for your colleagues or clients of, "I don't have to worry about
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.460]   this."
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.560]   So having a place where not only they can see their work is waiting to get done, but
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.520]   a place to put all their thoughts about their work, the files, the notes.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.180]   You can tell them to do that directly, or if they send it to you, you can just add it
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.180]   to a card.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.920]   That's not a big deal to add information to a card.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.800]   If it's your boss, you should do that for them.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.020]   None of this is a big deal.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.040]   They're happy that this is being taken care of.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.680]   You have this transparency.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.360]   Now what you have to do is work really hard on the things that are in the active list,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.960]   and you have to let people know when you pull a new project into the active list.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   This is critical.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.640]   You've got to email whoever is involved in that, whoever assigned it to you, whoever
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.900]   else you're working on, and say, "Hey, I'm actively working on this now.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.580]   It's on my active list link.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.600]   I'm all in on this.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   Let's rock and roll.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   Let's meet.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   Email me."
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.400]   All the stuff that is kind of annoying, it's not so annoying to me anymore because this
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   is just one of three projects I'm going.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   Let's go.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   Let's kick it off.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   Let's have a meeting.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   Let's have a brainstorm.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   Let's figure out a plan.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   I have a lot of time to dedicate to this."
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   You just get that thing done.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.840]   So you have to let people know.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   You got to actually do the things that are active and let people know when you're doing
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   those things.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.600]   As people have gone through two or three of these cycles with you, they're like, "Okay,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.400]   I get how this works.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   This is cool.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.780]   Cal will let me know when my thing is active.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.140]   If I think of thoughts and I send it to him, I know it'll be stored.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.180]   I trust him.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.340]   When this thing gets active, he's going to let me know, and he's going to get after it,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.900]   and this thing's going to get accomplished pretty quickly, and it's going to be accomplished
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.580]   well."
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:34.500]   So another thing that this is going to help you is this is going to allow you to avoid
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.420]   having to do these prioritization decisions in the moment of like, "Is this important
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420]   or not?"
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.780]   Saying yes or no.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:47.300]   This is kind of the problem with a lot of minimalist approaches to workload management.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.380]   It's basically so you have to say no more often.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.060]   You have to say yes to fewer things, like, "What's the one thing you want to do?
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.700]   What's essential?"
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.060]   The problem with these approaches is that's like difficult decisions to make, especially
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:02.060]   when it's 4 p.m. on a Friday and you're tired and your boss puts his head in the door and
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.740]   is like, "I need you to update the bulletin part of the website," or, "I think we need
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.580]   a better strategy," or, "We need to figure out if we should be using chat GPT."
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.900]   Whatever they're throwing at you.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.760]   It's really hard in the moment when you're exhausted.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.760]   They're there.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   They want this from you.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.340]   The pressure's on for you to do the calculation and say, "No, this is insufficiently important
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.020]   to the one thing I want to be working on."
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.500]   It's too difficult in the moment.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.820]   This approach allows you to get around that because you can sort of soft commit to one
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.820]   of these things.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.840]   In the moment, it just goes onto your list.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:40.440]   And now, when things are on your list, we can start talking about reprioritization and
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.880]   deaccessioning, actually taking things off the list.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.080]   You can think now about priorities.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.840]   When people bring you new things or they're asking you about something, you can talk to
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.360]   your boss or clients about, "How should we mess with the order of this list?"
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.840]   I think that's something you want to be doing a lot.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.480]   The waiting list.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   The column in Trello.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.040]   "Hey, where do you want this?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   How urgent?
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   Here's my list.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.120]   It's either at the top or in the middle.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   Where do you think this should fall?"
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.960]   You get the stakeholders who are giving you this work involved.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   You're often doing this reprioritization.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.320]   Now, what's going to happen here is that the things that kind of went on your list
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.640]   that weren't really that important, it was like in the moment, a brainstorm, or as things
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.080]   developed, it turned out to be less important than you thought.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.840]   They're just going to sort of stay at the bottom of the waiting list because things
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.400]   keep getting moved above them.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.240]   So you need to be willing to reassession or deassession those things.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.080]   Maybe move them diplomatically over to the back burner list, and then at some point maybe
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.880]   take them off that list altogether.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.380]   There's a good opportunity here to see what really is important.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.880]   If you've been languishing on my waiting queue, it keeps getting moved down, things
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.400]   getting replaced, then we know that wasn't a right thing to be working on anyways.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.800]   So you have to allow reprioritization, and you have to do these deassessioning.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.120]   This is what I would do as an individual.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.920]   Again, there is some pain in doing this, but it's not as bad as you think.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   Blame me.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.640]   Say it's a Cal Newport idea.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.960]   But I'm telling you, the problem you're solving for your colleagues and clients is making
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.500]   their life easier.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.080]   Knowing you have this way of working, and it produces good results, and I don't have
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.920]   to keep track of things, I don't have to bother you, I don't have to remember things, I know
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.880]   how to deal with getting you work, and if I have ideas about that work that I can send
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:34.160]   it to you, and I can watch it get captured, eight times out of ten, this is going to fly.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   Two times out of ten, it won't.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.680]   Eight times out of ten, this will fly.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.360]   And it will make your life, if it does fly as an individual, it's going to make your
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.320]   life so much better, because again, two or three projects worth of administrative overhead
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.120]   is cake.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.500]   You can do all of the 1990s, 1980s-style productivity tips for figuring out the most urgent thing
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:59.680]   to work on, and the quadrants, and all that stuff works when you have three projects worth
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.480]   of administrative overhead.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   Not when you have 13.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.400]   Then you're just, ah, until blood comes out of your eyes.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.240]   Three, you could do that.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.920]   What about if you're on a team?
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.640]   How does this work if you're on a team and everyone's on board?
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.120]   Well, in this case, and this I detail in particular in the book, because there's a specific case
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.840]   study of a team doing this in the book, so I write about exactly how they do it.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.860]   You have on a wall somewhere, be this physical or virtual, post-it notes for all the project
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.980]   ideas or feature additions, or whatever your units of work is.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   You store them.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.220]   Whenever something comes up, we should do this.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.380]   We need to update the website.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.980]   We need to add this feature to the software.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.180]   We need to gather a report of all of the statistics.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.500]   Every time an idea for a project comes up for the team, it goes on a wall, be it real
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:50.860]   or virtual, in a big column that's for stuff we might do.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.540]   So if someone has an idea, they have a place to put it where they know it won't be forgotten.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:00.500]   Two, you have another column in this wall for each of the people on the team.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.780]   And when someone is working on something, you move that, be it physically or virtually,
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.780]   into their column.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.340]   So you can see right away, what is everyone working on?
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.220]   You can also see right away, how much is everyone working on?
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.320]   And again, you want this to be one or two things, maybe three, depending on what type
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.460]   of work you're doing.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:25.580]   The final piece of this team-based two-status workload management is that you have a regular,
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.140]   efficient, highly-structured check-in meeting.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.700]   You could do this in the morning or midday.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.460]   It could be every day, would probably be good.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.460]   Maybe every other day, maybe Monday, Wednesday, Friday, where we check in on this wall.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.420]   Okay, how is everything?
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   What are you working on?
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.420]   I see it on the wall.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.420]   How is that going?
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.420]   Do you need anything from anyone else?
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420]   What's holding you back?
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.420]   Let's figure this all out right now.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.420]   We don't have to do a bunch of emails.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.420]   You're going to need this information.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   You're going to need that.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.420]   Okay, let's just write down.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   This is your document, like a log of each meeting.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.500]   This is all in stone, right, so you can't get away with ignoring it.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.100]   Okay, so like Dan, you want to get Laura.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   She's going to need this information.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.100]   When can you get it to her?
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.100]   You're going to do it by tonight.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.980]   Okay, he's stuck because he's waiting for that.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.180]   You figure out who needs what, fine.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.660]   If someone is done with something, it is in these team meetings, you look at the big pile
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.180]   of stuff we could do, and you figure out as a team what things should this person work
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.180]   on next.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.860]   We're going to pull something new to their column.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.700]   And this is how you handle work.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.700]   So nothing gets lost.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.900]   If you have an idea, it goes on the wall.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   You know what you're working on.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900]   You get what you need from people.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.740]   As you finish things, more things come over.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.840]   People are churning through things pretty quick.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.460]   But just like with our Trello list, one of the key things about this is you see languishing.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.240]   This thing was on the wall for the last two months.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.300]   We keep prioritizing other stuff over it.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   You know what?
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.100]   I don't think that was as important as it felt at the time.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.780]   Let's take it off the wall.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:50.260]   And you get this deaccessioning based on your implicit aggregate priority decisions.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.820]   So real teams use this, right?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.820]   Real teams use this.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.740]   They used to use Post-it Notes.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.540]   If you're a software developer, this sounds familiar.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.540]   This is a modification of a Kanban-style Agile methodology.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.820]   Yes, software developers are way ahead of the rest of us knowledge workers on this.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.340]   So no, this is not an original idea, but you can adapt it to almost any type of knowledge
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:13.060]   work, which is the key idea I make in this book.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.060]   All right.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.540]   So what do we have in common here?
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.980]   Having two statuses, whether we're in a team or an individual, having two statuses, actively
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.820]   working on, waiting to work on, a place for the waiting to be, a place to gather information
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.300]   about the waiting, transparency into what is where so we can have group reprioritizations
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.420]   and deaccession decisions will drastically improve your life.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.300]   Now, again, we want to get to the solution without getting to the core of the problem.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.540]   And I'm just going to give this quick aside and then we'll move to questions.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.540]   I'll give this quick aside.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.740]   But this is one of the big problems we have, I think, dealing with some of the issues in
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.460]   digital knowledge work is that we don't go deep enough.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.460]   We look at the issue.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.020]   Oh my God, I'm getting all these emails.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.380]   And we just treat it at the symptom level and we like personify people are being bad.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:04.120]   People have bad expectations and we see it as almost like a bad habit people have.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.380]   We were just doing good work and then we have this arbitrary habit of sending each other
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.380]   lots of emails.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.640]   And so just tell people, knock it off.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   Don't send so many emails.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   I'm only going to answer them once a day.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.580]   And of course, this fails, but when we understand the underlying problem, oh, I see.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.680]   The front office IT revolution created these massive workload footprints and this fine
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.960]   grained ability to constantly be dealing with overhead for this massive workload footprint.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.320]   We have to reduce the overhead.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.980]   We have to reduce the number of active projects we're working on.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.260]   That gets to the real solution.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.660]   Now you can slow down.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.160]   You can slow down your day, even if you are sort of paradoxically accomplishing what you
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.900]   accomplish at a faster rate.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.900]   So there's my big idea.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.520]   This come, we've been talking about this and I don't know, I'd say 75% of the interviews
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.380]   I've done for this book.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:58.540]   This idea of the two status workload has come up as simple as practical.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.320]   It gets to the core of an issue in digital era knowledge work.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.820]   All right, what I want to do next is move on to some questions from you, my listeners
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.500]   about related issues.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.660]   But first, I want to give a brief word from our sponsors.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:22.640]   In particular, this episode is sponsored by BetterHelp, and we talk a lot about the show
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.820]   on the show about how to construct a deeper life in this world of constant digital distractions.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:35.340]   It is hard to put together a deep life if your brain is not on board with it.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.620]   If you have ruminative thoughts, you have anxiety, you have depressive thoughts, you
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.820]   have sort of excessive fears about things.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.880]   It is very easy, especially in the current world that we talk about on the show all the
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.620]   time for your relationship with your brain to become strained.

[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.300]   If you don't like the fit, you can switch to a different therapist at any time for no
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.900]   additional cost.

[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:02.700]   We also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.500]   Look, I'm a computer scientist, so I'm telling you this.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.780]   You need a VPN.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.460]   Here's why.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.820]   When you access the internet, the websites or services that you're accessing are clearly
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.260]   listed on all of what are called packets, the little bundles of data that you send out
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.920]   onto the network itself.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.300]   Anyone looking at these little bundles of data can see what sites and services you're
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   using.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.320]   So if you're in public, let's say on a wireless Wi-Fi connection, anyone with a radio antenna
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.740]   can look at exactly what sites or services you're using.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.860]   If you're at home, your internet service provider can look at exactly what sites and services
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.860]   you're using.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.540]   They can gather this data, they can sell this data to advertisers.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:49.020]   And if you think they're not doing that, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I want to
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.140]   send to you.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:56.380]   A VPN helps you avoid this privacy violation.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.380]   Here's how a VPN works.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.180]   Instead of talking directly to a site or service that you're interested in, your computer is
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.860]   instead going to encrypt the real message you want to send and send it to a VPN server.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.260]   The VPN server unencrypts it and then talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.060]   the response and sends it back to you.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.780]   So now anyone in the coffee shop listening to your Wi-Fi connection or your internet
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.340]   service provider, all they learn about your internet activity is that you're using a VPN
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.660]   and you're talking to a VPN.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.940]   They learn nothing about what sites or services you're going to.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:34.140]   If you're going to use the VPN, the one I recommend is ExpressVPN.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.620]   They have fantastic software, it's easy to use, you just turn it on and you use your
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.380]   apps and web browsers, just like normal.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.300]   All this happens in the background.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.180]   They've got VPN servers all around the country and the world.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.540]   So no matter where you are, there's probably one nearby to connect you to get that fastest
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   connection.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.100]   They have plenty of bandwidth as well.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.900]   It's a seamless, quick experience.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.700]   It's rated number one by CNET and TechRadar.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.580]   It works on phones, laptops, you can even turn it on on your Wi-Fi router in your home,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.140]   meaning that all devices connecting to your home network are now going to automatically
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.860]   have their traffic routed through a VPN.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:13.100]   Privacy for all in your house made easy.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.740]   So protect your online privacy by visiting ExpressVPN.com/deep today.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:26.540]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S VPN.com/deep and you can get an extra three months free when you

[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:34.380]   All right, so that's what we have for our sponsors.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.300]   Let's move on now to some questions.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:44.020]   I normally, Jesse reads these, so maybe I'll alter my voice for the questions.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.700]   If Jesse was here, he would recommend I use my French accent for the questions, but I
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.700]   will not.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.700]   I will resist.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   All right.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.700]   Our first question comes from Jessica.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.300]   Jessica says, I should start with the fact that I am neurodivergent and a very anxious
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.220]   person, which might answer part of the question, but I wonder how I can make myself stick to
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.860]   a simple productivity system instead of revamping everything pretty much every week.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:13.300]   I always feel like if I could just find the perfect system, it would fix everything.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:19.420]   Well, Jessica, I don't think your concerns here are specifically due to neurodivergence
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.420]   or anxiety.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:26.900]   They're common among people who get serious about how they organize their digital era
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.180]   knowledge work.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:35.300]   Part of the problem is a lot of people put, I would say, too much faith in what their
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.380]   productivity system can accomplish for them.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.680]   But here's the thing, productivity systems, they cannot do your work for you.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.960]   They cannot in themselves make you successful at your job.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.300]   They certainly cannot fix everything.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.260]   The world of digital knowledge work, what do productivity systems actually do?
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.300]   Two things.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.020]   They can help you make consistent and smart decisions about what to work on.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.740]   So get you out of that, free you from that mode of reactivity of just, oh my God, something's
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   due.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   Someone just emailed me.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.560]   I'm just trying to answer these incoming pings and put out the rapidly growing fires.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.580]   They can also help you avoid unnecessarily wasting your time and attention.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.300]   So I'm going to be more careful about how I deal with my brain.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.180]   I don't want to context switch too much.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:24.060]   I'm going to sort of build my scheduling and approach to work and my processes around one
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:29.420]   thing at a time, consolidating context switching, et cetera.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:35.380]   So smart decisions, planning, and help you avoid unnecessary drags on your time and attention
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.380]   so you get more out of your brain.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.680]   And this is more of scheduling and processes.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.220]   If you have ideas for both of those goals that are working for you, then you're getting
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.940]   most of the benefits a productivity system can get.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:56.420]   Now if you tune up the system, it'll be useful, but it's not going to be night or day.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.300]   Night or day is having something in place, planning that's smart for making decisions
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   and scheduling and process things in place to help you not waste unnecessary time and
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   attention.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.820]   Like going from zero to that is a huge win.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.940]   Beyond that, it's like two users taste.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.940]   It can kind of make a difference.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.300]   It's not going to be night or day.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.220]   So if you have something in place for both of these, and given that you're a long-time
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.140]   listener of the show you do, you're getting 80% of the benefits.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.020]   Now what about those other 20?
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.500]   Tune in once a quarter.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.980]   Once a quarter, be like, "Hey, what's working?
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.980]   What's not?"
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:28.980]   And make some tune-ups.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.480]   Don't have high expectations, but you do want to check in semi-regularly because you want
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.060]   to prune things out of these two points that aren't really working or wasting your time.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.460]   Or if there's a new type of challenge within these two points that has emerged that's not
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.300]   being addressed by your current systems or processes, you might want to tweak something
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   or add something new.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:51.460]   And this will help, but I would see this more like the key thing is I'm going to use a horticultural
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.460]   metaphor here.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.900]   The key thing is you plant a tree, the tree that yields the fruit of consistent smart
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.540]   decisions and unnecessary wasting of time and attention.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:06.180]   That's the big deal is planting the tree, having the tree, having those fruits.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.420]   Now over time, you want to prune it.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.780]   If you don't prune it, it's going to grow wild and maybe it's going to no longer produce
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:13.780]   any fruit.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.100]   So you can't just put something in there and let that go for the next five years.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.380]   But if you're just semi-regularly pruning this, a tree will keep growing and it'll keep
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.420]   delivering your fruits in some years better than others.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.980]   That's the way to think about this.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.300]   Don't put so much on the details of your system.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   Yes, you need a system, but those are the two things that can do.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.300]   It can't do your job for you.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   It can't make work easy.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.780]   It can't be I start turning this crank and on the other end, I'm the president.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.100]   It's not the way it works.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.100]   Work is hard.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.780]   In the end, you still have to give concentrated cognitive effort to things that are difficult
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.440]   to produce things that are valuable.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.180]   That's going to feel the same no matter what productivity system you have.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.900]   That's going to be hard no matter what productivity system you have.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.340]   You basically just want to try to clear out some of the biggest obvious obstacles to doing
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.420]   that in a sustainable fashion.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.020]   All right, our next question is from DK.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:05.940]   DK writes, "I often have a large block at 90 to 120 minutes of time at the start of
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.500]   my day.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.280]   I want to use this time more efficiently, but it often gets eaten up by setting up the
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.560]   rest of the day.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.840]   Even if I've completed a weekly and/or daily plan, I end up preparing for meetings, triaging
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.160]   my messages, or getting caught up on Slack threads.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.840]   How can I be more effective at the start of my day?"
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.720]   Well, DK, I have three ideas for you.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:34.680]   One, prepare the day before for what you're going to do at the start of your day.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:40.440]   Mark off that time like a meeting on your calendar, and have a set place you're going
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.200]   to go to do that work that's different than where you do Slack, that's different than
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.480]   where you think about your meeting prep.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.920]   Your day starts off not, "Okay, let's just rock and roll on all my channels and then
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   get to work."
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.080]   No, your day starts off, "I'm going to my writing set, I'm going to the coffee shop,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.600]   I'm doing my 20-minute thinking walk to get going, and I have everything right here to
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.480]   start working on this code, this memo, this business strategy, whatever, this big project."
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.560]   And it's scheduled, and that's what I do.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.600]   And you're going to be nervous about it.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   What if I'm missing things?
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.400]   What if in that first 90 minutes, really critical things happened, and you know what?
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.360]   It won't, and you'll be fine, and then you'll stop worrying about it.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.480]   People can call you if it's urgent.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   They'll respect it like, "Yeah, I start with hard things, then I get after like meetings
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   in Slack."
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.480]   They'll be fine.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   And you'll be fine.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.640]   So you just got to be more definitive about this.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.280]   All right, second thing to suggest, do more preparation at shutdown instead of the beginning
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.600]   of the day.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.800]   Over the last half hour of your day, and again, protect this on your calendar, let that be
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   the time where you're preparing for the next day.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   Shutting down open loops.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.640]   Do I have what I need for these meetings?
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.880]   If not, let me schedule time before the meeting to do the prep.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.240]   I like my plan for the day, okay.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.480]   What am I doing to start the next day?
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   Great.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   Let me gather all my materials.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   Great.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   Schedule shutdown confirmed.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.880]   Check the schedule shutdown box on my time block planner.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   Unload from work.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   Next day starts.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.260]   You get right into the deep work you want to do in that day because you already went
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.520]   through all the process of looking at your next day.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.240]   Do it the day before, not the morning of.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.600]   Third idea, do more meeting processing proximate to the meetings.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.540]   I'm a big believer of when you schedule a meeting, scheduling time either before, after,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.600]   or both.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.680]   Time before to prep for that meeting, if you need that.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.760]   Definitely time after, 15 to 30 minutes.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.520]   Always add that to your calendar to process everything that just happened in that meeting.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.200]   All right, let me just stop for a second.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.680]   What came out of this meeting?
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.100]   What decisions were made?
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.640]   What do I now need to do?
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   What do I need to remember?
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640]   Let me get that into my systems.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.480]   Let me update what I need to update.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.560]   I promised to contact these three people.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.880]   Let me contact those three people.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   Okay, good.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.760]   I can now shut down that meeting.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.900]   If you go straight from a meeting to something else, all of that post-meeting work just sticks
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.800]   around in your head and causes a problem.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.280]   So meetings are not just the time you're talking to other people.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.680]   It's the time you're talking to other people and the time you need to make sense of that
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   and prepare for it.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.720]   If you do that on your calendar as well, then you'll feel more sort of in control of what's
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   going on.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.080]   But mainly, you just have to protect that time.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.840]   You don't want to be doing Slack and meeting prep during those first 90 minutes.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   Don't.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.440]   Figure out a way to get that done without having to use your first 90 minutes.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.520]   I think the benefit will be worth it.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.760]   All right, my next question is from Skeptical Sally.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.920]   This is someone talking about their partner.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   That's always fun.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.200]   Hi, Cal.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.120]   My partner is a director of product management at a startup.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.560]   And despite having risen through the ranks there, he has yet to be rid of a lot of the
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.240]   lower level work on his plate.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.360]   He also has meetings all day, almost every day.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.520]   Many things cannot be done without his input, but he is predictably exhausted all the time
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:48.000]   and has no time to do the thinking and writing work compounding the issues.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.240]   His most important work is to think so engineers can build the right thing.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.760]   And he has no thinking time because of overhead and meeting happy colleagues.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.360]   He claims there's nothing he can offload and he can't cancel meetings because too much
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.720]   won't move forward.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   But I don't buy it.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.280]   All right, Sally, I don't buy it either.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.020]   I mean, here's what I do buy.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.600]   And this is a common trap when people are dealing with overload and digital knowledge
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.280]   work.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.600]   The common trap is to say, can I take work in the way I have it unfolding right now and
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.400]   just start not doing the things that I'm not liking?
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.960]   Can I just start canceling meetings?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.920]   He's like, well, no, because these are projects that I'm supervising and I have to supervise
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.960]   them and they need meetings.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.480]   Or he's like, can I just, uh, can I radically reduce the projects?
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.800]   Well, for a lot of people that could be, yes, using the system I talked about in the deep
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.520]   dive of today's episode, you could have active projects and waiting projects.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   Managers can't always do that though.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.440]   It's like, no, these are the projects going on.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.640]   I'm in charge of them, but not in charge of deciding what we do.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.960]   And so, no, I can't offload projects.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.720]   And then they throw up their hands, but what they don't think about is can I change the
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.200]   structure in which this work is actually happening?
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.360]   Not changing what I'm doing, but changing how I'm doing it.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.000]   And here we often get significant failures of imagination.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.960]   So Sally, here's what I would tell your husband.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   Here's what you're going to do.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:14.280]   Two and a half hours every afternoon, maybe three, it's going to be a 30 to 60 minute
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:19.820]   office hour block right there in your afternoon, your door is open, you have a Zooms or Teams
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.760]   turned on with a waiting room and your phone is on.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.600]   The rest of this time you have a Calendly, whatever type setup, 15 minute blocks, 15
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.040]   or 30 minute blocks, you choose which is like 90 minutes to two hours of just boom, boom,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   boom.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.920]   You can go in there and grab any block you want.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.560]   Here now is how you deal with all of your teams.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.200]   Teams that just require an answer and they can be answered in a single message.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.880]   Hey, what is my budget for this again?
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.720]   What is my timeline for this again?
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   When is it?
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.160]   Have you heard back yet about whatever?
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.600]   Those can be emailed.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   Great use for email.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   They show up, they sit until your partner is ready to look at his emails and he can
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.000]   send back answers and get the information to people, minimal overhead.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Great.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.480]   Things that require some back and forth.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.920]   Come to my next office hours.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.160]   You're never more than a few hours away from my office hours.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.840]   Drop by, jump on a Zoom waiting room, 10 minutes.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   Let's pound it out.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   Like what's going on here?
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.840]   What's holding you up?
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   How can I help you?
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   Hmm.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   Hmm.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   Okay.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   This, this, this.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.840]   Good.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   Let's go.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   You have an issue that's more complicated than that.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   No, we really need to think.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   Great.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   Grab a 15 or 30 minute slot.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   You don't even have to tell me, just do it.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.120]   The way I do in the afternoons is I just go to these meetings that are scheduled.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.200]   We'll rock and roll and have the longer discussions if you don't want to just jump into office.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.960]   It's going to take more than five minutes.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   Schedule one of those slots.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.960]   Guess what?
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.920]   This is going to handle 95% of what's happening in these meetings.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.200]   And yet consolidate all of that to two to three hours a day, leaving your husband's
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.280]   entire mornings free, right?
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.720]   This could make a huge difference.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.880]   It's not changing what you do, managing products and talking to people about what they need
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.680]   for their projects, or it's not changing your workload even.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.440]   It's how you do your work.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.320]   Make a huge difference.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   Two, because he's in charge, he's a director here, demand better meetings, too.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   All right.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   You can come to the office hours.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   You can grab one of these slots.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:20.120]   But I'm going to use the Jeff Bezos or General George Marshall approach of here is what I
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.600]   expect if you were bringing me into a discussion that takes my time, that you have done most
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:32.120]   of the work on your own to figure out what's going on, where's the sticking point, where
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:38.600]   do I need outside help, what specific help do I need, what's all the relevant information
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   you need?
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:45.320]   Jeff Bezos demands that you send him all of this in a two-page memo a certain amount of
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.560]   time before any meeting.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.520]   So the meeting can be like a laser beam.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.120]   This is exactly where we need your help.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   You already are briefed.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.640]   You already know exactly why we're asking you and what you need.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   What's your decision?
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.000]   This cuts down the time required to meetings to be very short.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.080]   It also reduces the number of meetings because a lot of people use meetings as a way, as
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.720]   like a crew time management tool, like I don't really know what to do next.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.240]   I don't have a lot of control over my schedule or time.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.160]   I don't really want to sit and think too much about it.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.600]   But what I can do is just get a meeting.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.800]   Now I put a meeting on the schedule.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   I'm no longer stressed about this because I'm like, when we get to the meeting, that's
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.760]   when the work will happen.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:25.920]   But if you're the director of product management, rather, it's not your goal to do this work
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   with people.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.120]   It's not your problem that people are uncomfortable with, how am I going to remember to make progress
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.120]   on this project?
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.280]   It's not your problem that the way they want to work is just put calendar things on and
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.260]   then get the work done in the calendar things.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.600]   You demand, I need that memo.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.360]   So maybe now what you do is like, okay, before you come to office hours or schedule one of
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.920]   these things, like maybe office hours, you can drop by, but these are five minute discussions.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.760]   If you want to schedule one of these 30 minute meeting blocks as part of that scheduling
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   form, you're pointing me towards a shared document that has the full briefing and these
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.040]   are exactly what we need your decision on.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   Here's all the information.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   Do I have all the information?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.760]   Here's all the information you need to make this decision.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.840]   Here's what needs to be discussed in the meeting.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.920]   And those meetings become more efficient.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.720]   I'm telling you, 95% of your interaction could now happen in two and a half to three hours
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.340]   a day.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.720]   Imagine now what that's going to open up for your partner in terms of the thinking he can
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.120]   do, the strategy, the leadership he can do.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.880]   It also frees up a lot of time for the meetings that won't fit in there.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:29.400]   When the CEO is like, we need you to come to the strategy session, when the big client
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:34.200]   presentations in town, now you have the breathing room to do those things because your day is
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.520]   not with these haphazard meetings that are longer than they need to be and too haphazardly
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   scheduled.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.520]   All right.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.920]   So, so point them towards me, Sally.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   I think his life could be a lot better.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.720]   All right.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.120]   Here's another question from Glenn.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.520]   Ooh, another, it's another husband-wife question.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.460]   My wife and I run a small accounting and bookkeeping business.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.400]   It's just the two of us.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.040]   We deliberately decided when we started, we did not want to manage other people and instead
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:08.320]   reverse engineered how much we need to make and what that would look like for client load.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   My question is, given the nature of our work, which is repetitive and predictable, what
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.520]   kind of system would you recommend to track our tasks for each individual client?
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.160]   And can the task system interface with a calendar?
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.880]   My ideal system allows for a note section for when I meet with clients, I can store
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.160]   key information for the individual client.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.880]   Again, something self-contained for tasks, deadlines in the calendar, in theory, all
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.760]   integrated with each other plus notes.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.680]   Well, first, Glenn, I like the mini case study in here.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.760]   More people should do this.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   This is sort of a lifestyle centric career planning type move.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.720]   What do we want our life to look like?
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.240]   What role does work play in that, right?
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:52.080]   So you built the business to directly support what you want your life to look like.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.960]   Enough clients you don't have to worry, but not so many clients that it's a hassle.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   No one you have to manage.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.280]   You're really trying to hone in on what's important, what's not.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.840]   It's very different than the standard approach of like, how big can I make this business?
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.320]   Which for most people will just be a lot of stress.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   All right.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.800]   To your specific question, my concern here, it's not really a concern, but I think you
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.280]   want a complicated system.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.660]   You want some sort of like Zapier enhanced Notion workflow setup that is going to do
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.560]   everything for you.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.200]   This goes here, this automatically goes there, but you're not the right use case for that.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:32.760]   Like when I'm thinking of like a cool Notion workflow, like the use case is usually a situation
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.480]   where the complexity, the information is very complicated.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:40.120]   There's a lot of information associated with what's going on and you need to be able to
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.480]   find information and put it in the different views.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:50.520]   So like information rich, information complicated setups are where you want to have these sort
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.680]   of database driven, customizable data systems, right?
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.800]   Like our ad agency uses these systems for managing all the advertisers because there's
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.880]   like a lot of information from these advertisers that they need to work with in different ways.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:13.040]   So like they can show us, for example, a work table where just show Cal and Jesse the advertisement
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.920]   reads happening for this week's episode.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.800]   And here are the scripts for it.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.720]   But we can also then say, let me take this advertiser that I'm doing a read for next
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.600]   week and let me see a break that out now and show me all of the ad reads I've done for
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.160]   them in the last, let's say six months.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:33.000]   Now, so when you need to be doing these sort of complex interactions with data, these systems
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.560]   like air table or notion, these integrations can be incredibly useful, but your company's
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.080]   too simple for that.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.120]   It's too simple for it.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.680]   Now you could build one of these systems if you like it, but it's not like this is holding
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   you back.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.200]   So like in your case, what would I do?
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   All right.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:53.560]   You need some sort of a place for holding tasks or information for each client.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.560]   Like it could be a Trello board.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.960]   It could be a folder on Google drive.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.960]   All right.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.600]   We know here's what's pending.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.160]   Here's like what we're working on right now.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.600]   The deadlines, we can attach files to things.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.160]   We have notes relevant to the client.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   They're all in this one place.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.640]   Every client has their own board or directory fine.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.320]   Then basically what you need to do, and I know this is not exciting, is have an all
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:19.000]   hands on deck meeting, which means you and your wife, Glenn, on Friday afternoon, and
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.120]   you look through your clients.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   What's okay.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   What's on their to do list?
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.120]   What do we finish?
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.120]   These things are active.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   What things need to be done this upcoming week?
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   And you make your plan for the week.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   It's a weekly plan.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.280]   And this stuff goes on the calendar or in a weekly plan document.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   All right.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   This is due this day, this day.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   When are we going to do this work?
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.000]   And maybe you're putting a lot of this work on your calendar.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.440]   Like this day, we're working on this client.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   We're doing on this.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.560]   You kind of build a plan for the week based on looking at what's going on with your clients.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.840]   I mean, without too many clients and without complicated data, that's fine.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:51.400]   The only other thing I would add into it, because you noted your work is predictable,
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.080]   is do autopilot scheduling to the degree possible.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.560]   Hey, we always have to file these type of things on the third Friday of every month
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   for our clients.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.000]   Like this is when we do that work.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.760]   Thursday morning, we always have four hours blocked off.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.280]   And me and my wife sit there and we go through and do all this filing.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.280]   Right.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.800]   And we've thought about how to make this a little bit more efficient now that we're caught.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.920]   So we don't have to think about, oh my God, this client needs this done.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.120]   We just know that always happens in this time.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.680]   And maybe we have like check-in calls we need to do with various clients.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.880]   We like to do them like once a month.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   And so we do those Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons and we kind of have a rotate.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.320]   We have a way, like those are always calls and we just sit there, we have our coffee,
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.560]   we go from call to call and we make sure everyone has a recurring call.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.200]   So you can have these autopilot schedules for the regular occurring work.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.560]   Here's when and how we get it done.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.380]   So you don't have to be making decisions.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.880]   You don't have to worry about falling behind and realizing something is due and it gives
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.040]   you a consolidation of like effort so you can look for ways to be more efficient.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.360]   So when you have like the same two days, you always see your client calls, you might eventually
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.960]   build a smarter system for how do we schedule these.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:01.360]   And maybe we want a Calendly and maybe we want a reminder system and you begin to find
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.680]   efficiencies when you consolidate like work with like work, right?
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.600]   So I think you need a good place to store information, tasks, and their status for each
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.600]   client.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.800]   You need to do a serious weekly plan, you need like two hours for this every Friday.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.480]   This is a big part of your business.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.880]   Make a plan for the week or two ahead.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.080]   Use some autopilot scheduling for the repetitive work.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.120]   That's probably what you need because bookkeeping is, again, it's not a situation where you
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.800]   have complicated changing data that you necessarily need to see in different views to figure out
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   what to do.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.980]   Let's do one more question.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.640]   This one comes from Scott.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.680]   Scott says, "What does Cal see in terms of the productivity potential of Apple Vision
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:46.720]   Pro as a way to create a virtual shed for a deep work session?"
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.520]   Well, Scott, I've been writing about this issue for years.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.380]   The term I coined for this is immersive single tasking.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:01.700]   The idea of using virtual environments as a way to help increase your focus on working
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.800]   on a single task.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:09.600]   So I've written about this on my newsletter essay, my blog newsletter for years.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.280]   I did some writing on the New Yorker for this.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.400]   I did a New Yorker piece back during the pandemic where I worked in a virtual world using a
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:23.000]   tool called Immersed, which at the time was the number one productivity app in the Oculus
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   app store.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.640]   And I talked to the founder of Immersed.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   It was interesting.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:34.120]   And I did some work in, I guess you would say it's like a pagoda in a sort of mountainous
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:40.160]   rainforest with fire pits crackling and the rain falling outside or whatever.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.360]   I'm really interested in this idea because we know, I mean, I talk about this a lot in,
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.440]   look, I'm going to keep holding this up, everyone who's watching, slow productivity.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.920]   I talk about this in slow productivity.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.760]   Environment matters.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.840]   We know this, but environment matters for cognition.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.920]   Like the environment you're in can help put you into the right mind state to do certain
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.320]   types of cognition more focused and more effectively.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:07.200]   And I am really interested in virtual environments being used to try to get this effect.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.400]   We're getting close to it.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.680]   Like there was a couple of problems I identified early on that have been solved or are being
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.840]   close to being solved.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.720]   So one of these problems was resolution.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.280]   You know, if I'm taking notes or whatever, or writing on a whiteboard, solving a math
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.360]   equation, in the virtual world, I need to see that really high resolution.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.800]   I need to be able to read things and write things.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.480]   That problem has been solved.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.160]   The current generation of VR, as well as sort of AR and MR things like Apple Vision Pro,
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.160]   it's there.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.960]   Like even a couple of years ago when I wrote about this for the New Yorker, that problem
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   had been solved.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:46.720]   I had three large computer monitors in this virtual world, and I could read them as if
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.520]   they really were very large computer monitors in the virtual world.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.620]   The resolution was there.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:55.380]   The bigger problem is input.
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:02.080]   So how do I, if I'm writing, for example, in a virtual world, how do I actually do that
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.240]   if I can't see my hands?
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.080]   Like how do I actually get that done?
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.000]   Here, this is getting solved in a way that is much better than it was a few years ago.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.800]   The way Immersed worked, and I never actually got this to work very well, there's a complicated
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.840]   way of mapping your real keyboard.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.080]   You could have your real keyboard in front of you.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.560]   Because Immersed was showing, in the virtual world, screens that were coming from your
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   own laptop.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.960]   It was screen sharing from your laptop.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.120]   So the VR helmet was creating the virtual world, but the things you were working on
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.560]   were happening on your laptop.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.400]   And you would put the laptop in front of you, but you couldn't see it, because you had a
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.800]   helmet on.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:46.880]   And they had this way of trying to map the keyboard, where they'd be like, OK, press
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.880]   the Q key.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   I guess it would show you the pass-through camera, and you'd press the different keys,
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.220]   and it would figure out where in the real space the keyboard was and the keys were.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:55:00.520]   And then it would show you your virtual hands and the keyboard, a virtual version of the
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.640]   keyboard that matched up with real world, so you could see your hands and type.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:08.200]   But it was kind of a clunky technology back then, and I never really got it to work very
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.880]   well.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.000]   They're getting much better at that now.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.120]   The look forward cameras and something like the Oculus Quest 3 are very high resolution.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.880]   They're getting much better at tracking your hands, learning what's in your environment,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.680]   like seeing a keyboard, mapping the keyboard, showing where it is.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.160]   It can do that more automatically.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.520]   The Apple Vision Pro, of course, has the advantage of it's made from the ground up, the mix virtual
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.580]   with the real world.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:40.040]   So it could take your real desk and then change all the background around it.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:46.040]   So you see your desk and your computer in front of you, but the sound and view is as
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:51.000]   if your desk and your computer is at the top of Mount Everest, and it's blowing snow all
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   around.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.280]   So then you can literally see what you're doing there.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.920]   So this problem is being solved as well.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.400]   So I think we're reaching the point where immersive single tasking, technically speaking,
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.720]   will have most of the main issues worked out.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.920]   Now it's just a sort of cultural habit practice, like will this actually work?
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:14.080]   Will this actually, when I can type and work seamlessly, but I'm in a fantastical environment,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.340]   will it help me focus better?
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.000]   Will it help me come up with more creative insights?
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   And we'll see.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.400]   The main thing I learned from that New Yorker piece is the thing that is going to drive
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.800]   innovation in this category is actually not people wanting to focus, it's people who want
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.660]   more monitors.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.220]   That's why I have faith that we're going to at least give immersive single tasking a good
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:39.280]   trial run, is people like having lots of monitors.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.520]   And this is something you can offer in virtual workspaces.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.880]   This was why Immersed was the number one productivity app, not because people wanted to work deeply,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.280]   but because they were at home during the pandemic, they were computer developers, and they were
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.240]   used to having two giant monitors at work, and at home they only had their MacBook Air.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.140]   And when they went into the Immersed world, they could have two giant monitors.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.880]   Some people would have up to five monitors.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.620]   I saw setups in Immersed where they had one, two, three, four giant monitors and a fifth
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.620]   up top.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.360]   They'd look up to see it.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.740]   So it was making people more productive because they wanted their multiple monitors and you
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.700]   could have them in the virtual world.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:19.080]   But when we're enjoying that benefit, we're going to be experimenting for free with the
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:25.800]   additional benefit of, I don't know, if I'm on top of the clock tower at Hogwarts, maybe
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:33.080]   I'm writing a better chapter of my fiction book than my one-bedroom apartment.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:37.800]   Or when I'm trying to solve a math equation, if I'm in the Great Hall at Oxford working
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:45.200]   on a virtual whiteboard, maybe I'm going to actually get into a flow state easier than
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.160]   if I'm in my WeWork and just looking around at the different cubicles.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.080]   So Scott, I'm interested in immersive single tasking.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.960]   Multiple multi-monitors is what's going to be the killer app that pulls people into virtual
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.400]   working.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.840]   But whether they find this extra side effect of the virtual environment being more conducive
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.040]   to focusing, we'll wait to see.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.360]   I want to try this out more too.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.600]   I should get a Vision Pro.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.640]   I should get a new request.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.040]   I haven't worked with this stuff recently, but I think I should.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   All right.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.680]   That's all I have for questions.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.760]   No calls today because, I don't know, Jesse knows how to do that.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   I don't know how to do that.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   But keep the calls coming.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.120]   We'll normally do them.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.440]   We got a final segment coming up, the books I read in March.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:26.040]   But first, I want to briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.080]   That's our longtime sponsors and good friends at ZocDoc.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:35.000]   ZocDoc is not only fun to say, it is also a free app and website where you can search
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.440]   and compare highly rated in-network doctors near you and instantly book appointments with
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.960]   them online.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.520]   We talk a lot about high technology on this podcast, so I'm often surprised by how primitive
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.480]   it is to actually set up and find healthcare appointments.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.560]   It's a lot of like calling people whose websites you found on Google and they're not taking
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:02.120]   appointments or they don't take your insurance or they do, but that's because they're terrible
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.520]   and no one likes to work with them.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.600]   And it's so primitive unless you use ZocDoc.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.640]   With ZocDoc now, you can just search.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:14.680]   I'm looking for this type of healthcare provider in my area, takes my insurance, looking for
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   new appointments.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.680]   Oh, here, here, here, and here.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:17.680]   Boom, right there.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.720]   Now, let me look at the reviews.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.680]   There's real verified user reviews on ZocDoc.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.800]   Do people like this doctor?
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   Oh, they do.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   Great.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   Now, let me book.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800]   Oh, I can do it right now online.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:31.520]   Now, I did the math, two different doctors right now who use ZocDoc.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.560]   It not only helps you find them, they also use the software to help you do like the pre-appointment
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   paperwork.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.240]   So you can just get that done before you show up.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:45.120]   It is the right way to seek out and set up healthcare appointments in our current age.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.640]   It's one of these ideas that it's surprising why this wasn't just here at like the very
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.160]   beginning of the internet.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   Who knows?
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.440]   But it is here now and ZocDoc does it right.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.420]   ZocDoc is a smart idea.
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:02.480]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.440]   Then you go ahead and find a book, a top-rated doctor today.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:13.200]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.440]   I also want to talk about our friends at Notion.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:26.360]   Look, if you run a business or your personal setup is one in which you have sort of complicated
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.640]   information that links together in different ways that you need to view in different ways,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:38.120]   Notion is absolutely the best in the business tool for making customized information workflows.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.480]   You can combine your notes, your documents, and your projects all together in one beautiful
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   space.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.540]   I even talked about Notion earlier in this episode where I talked about how our ad agency
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:53.520]   for the podcast uses it in a beautiful way that allows us, for example, to say, "Show
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.000]   me all the ads for this episode.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.240]   Okay, here's this advertiser here.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.720]   Show me all the ads we've done for this advertiser.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.200]   Show me all the other advertisers that have this similar attribute."
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.280]   We get these different ways of working with the data and seeing what we need to see, and
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.400]   I love the customizability of it.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.340]   It's a big idea for my books, like A World Without Email, that you need to build sort
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.840]   of custom systems and workflows.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.320]   Don't just like rock and roll on email and just try to make things work out.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   So Notion is fantastic.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.340]   But why are we talking about them today?
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:29.640]   Because they have a new feature, which I'm really excited about, and this is Notion Q&A,
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:37.280]   which uses AI as an AI assistant that helps you answer questions or search for information
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.160]   inside your existing Notion setup.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.520]   So it is a fantastic use of AI.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.440]   I'm very interested in these sort of what they call vertical AI applications, where
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.600]   you're using AI to solve a very specific problem.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.040]   And here the problem is, look, I got all this different information spread out in different
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.440]   formats and they're shown in different views.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.800]   And now let's say I have a question like, wait, where's next quarter's roadmap?
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.720]   Or what about the, I'm looking for the marketing proposal from two months ago that was sent
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.520]   by this client.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.720]   The Notion Q&A AI can just find this stuff for you.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.560]   It understands your information and can help you in seconds, dig up that information you
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.040]   need.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.420]   So now you have like the carefully constructed data views that you've built in your Notion,
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.240]   but you can get information that's not in one of these views or that you forgot where
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.520]   it is very easily.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.640]   It's like this extra little nudge that makes Notion just super useful, right?
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.880]   So the type of question you might normally turn to a coworker to answer, you just ask
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.420]   Q&A instead.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.840]   You could ask these questions from anywhere in Notion, find exactly what you need without
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.240]   even having to leave the dock, for example, that you're looking at right now.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.280]   And fortunately, you can trust your data is secure because Notion AI is designed to protect
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.360]   your information.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.120]   No AI models are trained on your information.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.720]   Your data is encrypted and answers given to you will never be used, will never use information
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.040]   from pages you don't have access to.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:16.920]   So try Notion AI for free when you go to notion.com/cal, now this is all lower case letters, notion.com/cal
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   we try the powerful, easy to use Notion AI today, when you use our link, you'll be supporting
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920]   our show.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.780]   So remember, all lowercase letters, notion.com/cal.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:34.740]   All right, now let's move on to our final segment of the show.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.320]   This podcast is coming out on April 1, so let's talk about the books I read in March
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320]   2024.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:45.200]   As long time listeners know, I aim to read five books a month and yes, that's what I
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   did in March.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.500]   It was kind of a weird month because I was traveling a lot, a lot of like big books that
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.100]   I half read and then actually I'm finishing in April.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:00.120]   But anyways, it's an interesting, I ended up with an eclectic list of books for March.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.320]   The first was A Short History of England by Simon Jenkins.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.600]   I put the word short in quotation marks, it's not exactly a short book, England, it turns
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.400]   out has a long history, but I wanted to know more about it.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400]   And it was interesting.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.520]   It's also, I'll tell you this, like from the American perspective, we're used to our own
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:24.240]   history having a relatively simple triumphant list core of we had this revolution based
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.480]   in these ideals and like we lived happily ever after.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.200]   England's history is messy.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:40.840]   It's kings, foreign invaders, tension and wars between like the kings and the people
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.200]   who were given land from the last foreign invaders who don't like the new kings, a lot
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.000]   of capriciousness and arbitrariness.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.880]   And yet somehow out of all this messiness and ugliness, what emerged in England, and
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.520]   this is the point Jenkins makes, I thought this was interesting, different than other
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   places in Europe.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.680]   What emerged in England was this like carefully balanced tension between the people and the
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.800]   monarch and the people for a while, meaning the earls, but then eventually a house of
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.720]   commons as well.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.560]   And they didn't really trust each other and they kind of kept each other in this sort
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.480]   of messy check in a way where power was way more absolute in other places like monarchical
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480]   power.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.200]   I thought that was interesting.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.560]   It's a messier history, but the messiness actually became a feature, not a bug.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.080]   It is why when post-American revolution, you have these sort of revolutionary movements
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.120]   across the world.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.400]   England sort of survives this in a very prosaic way without major reform.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.760]   They're not cutting off the heads of kings.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.760]   They did do that, but that was in the 17th century.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.080]   They're not toppling monarchy and starting a republic and then having that get toppled,
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.080]   have an emperor come in.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:49.400]   The messiness actually created enough sort of self-regulating, self-reinforcing loops
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.520]   that they were able to basically kind of adjust and tweak and get through that.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.680]   So it's an interesting history, but a long one.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.520]   Next book I read was Brian Keating's book Into the Impossible.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.640]   Into the Impossible is the name of Brian Keating's podcast as well, which I went on to talk about
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   slow productivity.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640]   It's a cool interview.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.020]   I went for it.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.640]   Brian Keating, Into the Impossible.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   Brian's an astronomer.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:17.200]   He's at UCSD, an astronomer who also has a public-facing podcast.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.920]   This was a cool book.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.480]   What I liked about this book, I told Brian this, it's like more people should do this.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480]   He looked in his field.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   He's a physicist.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:33.080]   He's like, I'm going to interview seven Nobel prize winners and just learn from them.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.340]   What's interesting that they learn?
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.320]   What interesting advice do they have?
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320]   That's the book.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.600]   And I told Brian, there should be more books like this.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.480]   More like, this is my field, and I've talked to like seven people who are very notable
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.880]   in this field, and here's wisdom from it.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   Let's not lose it.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   What did they learn?
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:55.280]   There should be a cool series, Barnes and Noble and Amazon, and you just see these monographs.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.680]   It's magazine writers.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.040]   It's tech CEOs.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:02.240]   Whatever the different areas are, and it's volume three.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.120]   Tim Ferriss did some books like this, but there should be more like this, I think.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.640]   We don't have to be fancy here.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.360]   Tell me about science in your life, and you want a Nobel, like why and how and what's
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.600]   important in reflecting it.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.760]   Let's extract your wisdom.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.360]   A quick read, but a good book.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:26.220]   Then I read Sharon Brous, B-R-U-O-U-S's book, The Amin Effect.
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:33.160]   So Sharon is a rabbi in the Los Angeles area who started this Jewish fellowship that is,
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.720]   I don't quite know how to describe it.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.920]   It's progressive, but not necessarily in a political sense, though it is, but more in
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.320]   a religious practices sense.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:46.160]   It's much more emotionally forward.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.280]   They dance a lot.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.760]   It's a more emotionally salient Judaism.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:56.000]   Anyway, she wrote this book about the Amin effect, talking about essentially, it's based
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.280]   on the idea of Amin and how this is something that's meant to be said together and about
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.360]   people coming together to deal with the hardship and challenges and joys of life.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.680]   It's a really cool theme, and she has a lot of good theology on it and a lot of good polling
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.920]   from her own experience, and it was a cool book.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.560]   The one thing I will say, I don't know if this is good or bad, I'm just going to say,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:23.920]   is throughout the book, 80% of the examples, it's all her dealing with congregants that
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.760]   are coping with unexpected and tragic death.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:35.520]   So it's very powerful on the one hand, but on the other hand, you would maybe be looking
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:42.560]   for more of a broadness, because in our age of social media, internet isolation, there's
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.000]   such power in this idea of real community built on real sacrifice, something I talk
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.040]   about all the time, and how this gets to the core of humanity.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.240]   But it's also heavy because it's all about the deepest tragedy in this book, that it
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.480]   can maybe accidentally create a sense of remove from the advice for your own life if you're
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.920]   not dealing with a tragic death, and yet you could still benefit from more of a communitarian
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.380]   approach to socialization.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.440]   So if you can kind of get past a little of that darkness, it's a very smart book and
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440]   she's a good writer.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   Then I read CS Forrester's Sink the Bismarck.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.560]   I love CS Forrester's book, The Good Shepherd.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.840]   I talked about it on the show.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.400]   I think it's like the original techno thriller, beautifully written, it's like an auteur
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.560]   type of work, all looking at one character, following them real time, it's just a fantastically
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.560]   written book.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:37.080]   I'm actually looking now for a first edition hardcover of The Good Shepherd because I want
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.480]   to have it as an artifact, as like one of the first true techno thrillers, like American
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   techno thrillers.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.420]   I know people look at Verne and Wells, but like modern form techno thriller.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.080]   So I read this other book, Sink the Bismarck, about the sinking of the battleship, the Bismarck.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080]   I was like, "Let's try this."
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.680]   It wasn't as good.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:59.360]   It was more disjointed and kind of all over the place and didn't have the rigor of this
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.800]   perspective narrator rigor and the following and the creation of mood.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.880]   So I like The Good Shepherd all the more highly because I think Sink the Bismarck was not
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880]   so good.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.280]   And then finally, I read Adam Grant's book, Hidden Potential.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.840]   I hadn't read Grant in a little while and I talked to him, I did his show, which I recommend
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.920]   everyone listen to my interview with Adam Grant, talking about slow productivity.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   I like Adam a lot.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.760]   I just want to catch up on what he's up to.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.620]   So Hidden Potential is a classic Grant, you know, drawing from the social psych research
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.420]   to get at this question of like, how do you unlock your internal potential?
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.720]   Like what Adam's very good at is here's like the four different ways the research has emerged
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.900]   that are relevant to this topic.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.260]   And let's get into each of those.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.280]   I'll give you really good stories, make it seem really applicable.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.660]   30% of the research is his own typically, which is always very impressive.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.680]   There's a reason why Adam Grant's books just dominate, like he's sort of taken over that
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   niche.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:01.960]   I think Gladwell gave it up when he went to work on his podcasting company.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.600]   I don't know who else was there, but this niche, I mean, I think Adam Grant is just
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.880]   the pretender to the throne who has won.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:14.000]   If you want science research, pulling lessons that are like relevant to your life, business,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   but also not necessarily business, made accessible, story driven, but with a deep understanding
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.800]   of the research, he's like killing it with that format.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.560]   So way to go, Adam.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560]   Classic Adam Grant book.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560]   All right.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.720]   Well, anyways, that's all the time we have today.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720]   We made it.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.720]   I don't like doing Jesse-free episodes, but we made it through, but I'm excited for him
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.320]   to be back next week.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.280]   Keep in mind that April 11th date when Jesse and I will be recording a live podcast at
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.160]   People's Book in Tacoma Park.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.120]   Be back next week with another episode.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.200]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:50.800]   Hey, so if you enjoyed our discussion today, I think you might also like episode 275, which
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.920]   gives a general system for achieving hard goals.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.760]   So check that out.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.600]   So the question I want to dive into today is how do you follow through on transformative
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.840]   goals?
