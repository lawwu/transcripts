[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.860]   New year, new diets, new focus on health. And today we look at intermittent fasting.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.720]   The question has come to us from several listeners. I pulled two. Here's a listener named Sharon.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.880]   "Pastor John, I have always thought of fasting as a special spiritual discipline between me and God,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.740]   a plea for dependence on Him as I pray about specific things.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.640]   But there's a new weight loss craze called intermittent fasting.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.160]   It's everywhere and people are losing weight, feeling healthier and living happier lives.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.820]   That's great, but for a believer is intermittent fasting sacrilegious if it's done merely for weight loss purposes?
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.040]   When is fasting not fasting for the Christian?"
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.240]   And a listener named Emelyn writes in to say she has tried it with some success toward the end of weight loss,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.000]   but now she wonders if it's appropriate for Christians to separate the physical discipline of fasting from its spiritual point.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.880]   She asks if "the regular discipline of intermittent fasting should be used by Christians merely to lose weight,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.200]   or does this goal prostitute a spiritual discipline and hijack it and turn it into nothing more than a physical body hack?"
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.400]   Pastor John, how would you answer Shannon and Emelyn?
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   My short answer is that fasting without any explicit Christian associations,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   simply for the possible physical benefits of it, is not a prostitution of a Christian practice
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.880]   and need not be any more of a sin than exercise or dieting.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.160]   Now, here's my thinking behind that answer.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.120]   Fasting was not a Christian creation.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.400]   In other words, the practice was not ours to begin with.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.880]   As a religious practice, it already existed among Jewish people in the Old Testament,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   but also among other religions, as is clear from the Old Testament.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.600]   We get a taste of what it meant for the Old Testament saints from Ezra 8.21, where Ezra says,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.680]   "I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.480]   to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and our goods."
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.480]   So, fasting was seen as a humbling of ourselves before God,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.000]   because it put the person who's fasting in the position of a person with hunger,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.040]   a needy position, a dependent position, symbolically as if we were poor,
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.280]   the people with no food, and the aim was to intensify the cry to God for help.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.080]   It was the embrace of physical hunger to express with greater earnestness the spiritual hunger
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.840]   for God, just like I need food, I need you, oh God.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.360]   But as significant as it was, the practice did not originate with the people of Israel.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   It appears that it was present in most other religions,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.720]   and we can see a few glimpses of this in the Old Testament.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.600]   For example, the Assyrians of Nineveh called for a fast when the prophet Jonah preached to them.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.480]   Darius the Mede fasted when he threw Daniel into the lion's den.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.240]   There's nothing distinctively Christian or Jewish about going without food for religious purposes.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.840]   Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to say that non-religious fasting
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.000]   is a prostitution of a Christian practice.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.920]   It might be in the mind of some particular irreligious person.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:06.040]   They might intentionally start with an awareness of the Christian practice and then consciously
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.880]   strip the practice of Christ and strip the practice of God and prayer.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:20.440]   That would be a kind of prostitution of fasting in their particular case, but that's probably
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.160]   not what's going on for most people who fast for dietary purposes.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.720]   I think what we need to be alert to that's more serious than a simple physical practice
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.640]   for the sake of health, which has a parallel with Christian practice for spiritual reasons,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:51.720]   more serious than that is when a Christian practice is taken over and treated by unbelievers
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:03.000]   as though it were simply physical bodily benefit, but really, really, there is a subtle spiritual
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.320]   dimension to it, which they say claims benefits coming from some higher power through the practice.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.800]   This may, in fact, be what's happening with some non-Christians in the practice of fasting,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.160]   though I'd be slow to say it's the main thing that's happening.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.240]   So, let me illustrate what I mean by this from Paul's letter to the Colossians.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.880]   In Colossians, as in the rest of the New Testament, humility, lowliness, is a good thing.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.400]   It's a beautiful virtue.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.880]   The Greek word, which will matter in just a minute, is tapinophrosyne.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.560]   Paul says in Colossians 3.12, "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.040]   compassionate hearts, kindness," tapinophrosyne, lowliness, humility.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.360]   But there were false teachers in the church at Colossae that used this word tapinophrosyne
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   similarly and yet subtly differently and made it part of their pagan practices
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.760]   that they insinuated then into the church.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:23.800]   So, in Colossians 2.18, Paul says, "Let no one disqualify you, insisting on tapinophrosyne."
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.440]   And it's translated in English as asceticism, a mistreatment, a lowly treatment of the body.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.720]   "And worship of angels, going on in detail about visions puffed up without
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.680]   reason by their sensuous mind and not holding fast to the head, Christ."
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.120]   In other words, the false teachers were treating this Christian disposition of
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.200]   self-humbling as part of their pagan way of worshiping angels.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.840]   And then Paul goes on to say, it gets right to the heart of the matter in verse 20, following,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:08.280]   "This has an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and tapinophrosyne,"
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.120]   asceticism, lowliness, self-humbling, "and a severity to the body, but they are of no value
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.200]   in stopping the indulgence of the flesh."
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.640]   Now, the reason I call that getting to the heart of the matter is that
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:31.640]   here we have a non-Christian use of a Christian virtue, and it has the appearance,
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.000]   Paul says, the appearance of wisdom, and particularly wisdom in showing severity to the
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.560]   body, kind of self-denial, probably including even then fasting, but while being hard on the body,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.840]   Paul says, it does nothing to stop the indulgence of the flesh.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:01.640]   In other words, a physical practice taken over from Christianity may have benefits physically
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:09.080]   and look like wisdom, but in fact may feed right into the flesh, that is, the proud,
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.400]   self-reliant, self-exalting aspect of human nature.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.320]   Now, that's what I think we need to be alert to.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.800]   Secular fasting as a physical practice to gain physical benefits, I don't think we should be
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.720]   on a crusade against that, but I think we should be alert to those cases where that practice is
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:41.560]   sliding over into the spiritual expectation that this really will make me a better person,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:49.640]   maybe even make me more pleasing to God, and if we detect that in somebody we know
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:57.320]   and we're talking to, say, about this issue, it may become a real, a really good opportunity
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:06.440]   to make the gospel clear, that is, to show people how gospel self-denial is really different
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.560]   from worldly self-betterment through asceticism or through fasting.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.360]   In the gospel, we can share this.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:22.600]   Right in this context, we can share that in the gospel, Jesus does the decisive work of forgiving
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:33.720]   our sins and accepting us through faith alone so that all our improvements after that are not a
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:44.040]   regimen of self-betterment, but instead a humble reliance on his grace to bring about our change
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:51.080]   so that even our fasting can then be seen as a pursuit of more of him.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:58.120]   Fascinating points here, Pastor John, distinguishing holy asceticism from self-righteous asceticism.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.000]   That's fascinating.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.440]   Thank you for that.

[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   how to get that Sunday morning worship vibe right.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.640]   How do you set the mood from the outset of the church gathering?
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.280]   Pastor John has put a lot of thought into this and how to do it on Sunday mornings,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.240]   and he'll explain how he did it next time.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.840]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.280]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
