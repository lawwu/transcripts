[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   I have never seen such compassion from a lot of people in my life toward any human, animal,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.000]   child as I have a lot of people in the way they interact with the robot.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Compassion.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.200]   I think there's something of, I mean I was on the robot owners chat boards for a good
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.920]   eight months and the main emotional benefit is she's never going to cheat on you, she's
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.160]   never going to hurt you, she's never going to lie to you, she doesn't judge you.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   I think that robots help people and this is part of the work I do with animals, like I
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.520]   do equine therapy and train dogs and stuff because there is this safe space to be authentic.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.620]   You're with this being that doesn't care what you do for a living, doesn't care how much
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.920]   money you have, doesn't care who you're dating, doesn't care what you look like, doesn't care
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.320]   if you have cellulite, whatever, you feel safe to be able to truly be present without
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.000]   being defensive and worrying about eye contact and being triggered by needing to be perfect
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.560]   and fear of judgment and all that.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.480]   Robots really can't judge you yet, but they can't judge you and I think it really puts
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.640]   people at ease and at their most authentic.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.920]   Do you think you can have a deep connection with a robot that's not judging or do you
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.040]   think you can really have a relationship with a robot or a human being that's a safe space
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.120]   or is attention, mystery, danger necessary for a deep connection?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.280]   I'm going to speak for myself and say that I grew up in Alcoa, Colombo.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.880]   I identify as a codependent, talked about this stuff before, but for me it's very hard
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.760]   to be in a relationship with a human being without feeling like I need to perform in
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.080]   some way or deliver in some way.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.880]   I don't know if that's just the people I've been in a relationship with or me or my brokenness,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.320]   but I do think this is going to sound really negative and pessimistic, but I do think a
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.240]   lot of our relationships are projection and a lot of our relationships are performance
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.720]   and I don't think I really understood that until I worked with horses and most communications
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.240]   human is nonverbal, right?
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.320]   I can say like, "I love you," but you don't think I love you, right?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.620]   Whereas with animals, it's very direct.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   It's all physical.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's all energy.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.800]   I feel like that with robots too.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.520]   It feels very, how I say something doesn't matter.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.240]   My inflection doesn't really matter.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.560]   When you thinking that my tone is disrespectful, like you're not filtering it through all of
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.960]   the bad relationships you've been in.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.160]   You're not filtering it through the way your mom talked to you.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.940]   You're not getting triggered.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.480]   I find that for the most part, people don't always receive things the way that you intend
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.920]   them to or the way intended and that makes relationships really murky.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   [silence]
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   [silence]
