[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.520]   Welcome to Portfolio Rescue, I'm Ben Carlson, your host, with me as always is Duncan Hill.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   How's it going, Duncan?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.520]   Today, I want to talk about inflation in my opener here, because no matter what the number
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.720]   is, people are going to be angry, right?
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.520]   It's really high right now, it's the highest it's been in 40 plus years, but no matter
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.280]   what happens, someone will say it's understated because if you go X this and X this and X
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.660]   this, then it should be lower.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.920]   But a lot of people say no, it's actually overstated because the government doesn't
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920]   count things the right way.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.680]   So I want to talk about this thing about people saying the inflation rate is always overstated
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   or understated.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.480]   John, put up this chart here about the consumer price index.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.320]   This is the consumer price index for shelter and it's showing over the last year it's less
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.880]   than 5%.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.840]   Now people are up in arms about this one because they throw their hands in the air and say
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   this is ridiculous.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.000]   Housing prices are up 20%, rents are up 17%, mortgage rates are at 5% now, how could the
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.400]   inflation rate for shelter be 5%?
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   I'm going to walk you through this and why this, for some people it's way more than that,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.880]   for some people it's probably less than that.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.160]   There's a 65% home ownership rate in this country.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.540]   That doesn't mean 65% of the people own homes because you could count, I think an apartment
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.360]   complex counts as one owner, whatever.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.700]   If you're one of the people that owns your home and you bought before rates rose or refinanced
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.040]   when rates were 3% or lower, those mortgage payments are fixed.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.640]   You've basically experienced deflation as housing costs have risen because your asset
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.640]   is up in value, right?
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   Your house has gone up 20% or 30% or 40% or 50% and your payment is fixed.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.460]   It's not moving at all.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.200]   So inflation rates are inherently personal.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.400]   So much of it depends on your spending patterns and your circumstances.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.920]   And so my point is the inflation rate that you see in the headline is always going to
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080]   be wrong for you personally.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.160]   And that's why people get so mad about it.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   I mean, it's, it's very personal.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.880]   Like you and Michael have talked about so much before.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.280]   It's what you buy, right?
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   Yes.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.580]   If you happen to have to buy a car in the last year and buy a house for the first time
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.240]   and you buy a bunch of meat all the time, like you're screwed.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   That's what I was about to say, you know, being, being vegan is like inflation proof,
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   you know?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   I'm just kidding.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   Coffee.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   Coffee is the main thing that I noticed.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.700]   Coffee is up like so much, you know, the coffee that I buy.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.520]   See that's why I'm going to be able to retire like seven days before you because I don't
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   drink coffee.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   Sure.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   It's true.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   All right.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   Remember, before we get to the questions, if you have one, ask the compound show@gmail.com
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   and let's get into it.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   Okay.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.320]   Also, I'll just apologize to everyone.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.300]   We don't have the clock ticker today, the comments, everyone seemed to love it so much
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.100]   last week, but, but yeah, we don't have a ticking clock.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.860]   I don't think anyone complained about it at all.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.860]   Not one person.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.860]   No.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.860]   I think everyone loved it.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.300]   It was a resounding success.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   Okay.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.260]   So up first, my husband and I are both in our early to mid thirties with 30 plus years
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260]   until we retire.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.880]   We are a hundred percent invested in equities, mostly index funds with about 16% company
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.900]   stock and about 5% in my fund portfolio.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.240]   What is the best way to start investing in bonds?
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.880]   One option would be to start buying $10,000 in I bonds over the next few years and continue
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640]   until we retire.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.140]   This would give us an income.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.740]   This would give us income spread out over retirement and in an emergency, we could cash
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.740]   out early.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.840]   Another option we've considered is to DCA into Vanguard bond funds starting in, uh,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.580]   in our mid forties, but with monthly income on these so low, uh, we'd need to have a lot
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.140]   saved to have any meaningful income from it.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.860]   So I'm leaning towards the I bond route.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.860]   What would you do?
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.960]   All right, let's talk about the I bonds first because they are so, so hot right now.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.680]   This is from the wall street journal, us treasury series.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.480]   I bonds will offer annual interest payments of 9.6% based on the bonds latest inflation
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.680]   calculation, which is tied to March's consumer price index.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.500]   Basically they recalculate the interest rate on these every six months and it's may and
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.680]   November and because rates are so much higher on these, this is basically the best deal
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.400]   you could get in fixed income right now.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.620]   It's backed by the government, their index to inflation.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.820]   They said the wall street journal article said over the past six months, $11 billion
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.860]   of these have been bought, which compared to the same period in 2020 was 1.2 billion.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.460]   So people are loving these things right now.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.980]   Um, they basically pay a fixed rate or they're supposed to, and that's set by the treasury.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.620]   That rate has been set at zero for a long time, but you're just getting the inflation
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.620]   kicker.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.540]   So if you want to know how that interest rate is determined, it's basically determined on,
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.720]   on the last six months of, of CPI data.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.280]   One other positive, I talked to our tax expert bill suite on this.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.820]   You don't pay state income taxes on this because it's a federal bond, but you also can defer
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.420]   federal income tax on that income until redemption.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.100]   So again, interest is compounded semi-annually.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.220]   You can, you do have to hold it for 12 months after you buy it.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.580]   So you have to cash it out after 12 months and if you redeem before five years, you're
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.020]   going to give up three months worth of interest, right?
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.020]   So you know, if you do redeem after 12 months, you're, you're only getting 75% of that interest.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.020]   Here's the problem.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.140]   After five years, no penalties, nothing like that.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.920]   You can only invest $10,000 per household.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   So I know a lot of really wealthy people say that's not enough.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.600]   I think if Biden wanted to score some political points right now in the crazy political inflation
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   environment, he'd probably up that cap.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.960]   I don't know, 15, 20,000.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.000]   And it seems like they could do away with the federal, federal tax, you know, like why
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.360]   is there a federal tax on these if they really are supposed to help middle class people save,
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   you know?
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   That's true.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.280]   And if you took your tax refund and send it right there, you could do an extra 5k, I guess
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.400]   you could do 15 if you wanted to.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.560]   The problem with these things, you have to buy them straight from the US government at
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   Treasury Direct.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.120]   John, pull up that, that website.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.760]   This website looks like it was created in 1994 by like a 12 year old.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.700]   I really like the idea of buying these bonds, but it's not user friendly at all.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.860]   Like shocker, the US government doesn't have a good technology system.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.860]   It's very clunky.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.860]   The customer service isn't great.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.860]   It's not a great user experience.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.720]   One of the other things, like if you and a spouse wanted to buy one, Duncan, you and
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   your wife wanted to buy one, you have to do, you can't do joint accounts.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.600]   So you'd have to do one, set it up.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.800]   She'd have to do one as well.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   You can't buy IRAs.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.880]   You can't buy them with IRAs as far as I know.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.800]   You can buy them, you know, on behalf of your children if you wanted to.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.440]   And the other thing is if you wanted to use them for educational expenses, then you're
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   paying no tax at all.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   So you want to use these as a 529 vehicle.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.840]   So I actually think, so if you're one of these people, you know, you're in your 40s and you're
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   getting closer to retirement than you are from your 20s, you're thinking, how do I more
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.480]   conservatively like slowly but surely get there, right?
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.080]   Because how do I do that glide path sort of thing?
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.680]   This probably isn't a bad way to do it, where you buy this 10K every year and slowly build
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.200]   up that bond position.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.360]   Now you can't actually find yield on other bonds right now.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.400]   So the SHY is one to three-year treasuries.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.560]   It's yielding 2.5% right now.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.320]   IEI is the three to seven-year treasury ETF.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.680]   It's yielding almost 3%.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.400]   Corporate short-term yields at SLQD is over 3%.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.480]   Josh wrote a good piece the other day talking about how he was buying SHY, I think.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.680]   So if you're a person who holds bonds right now, it doesn't feel very great.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.840]   But if you're dollar cost averaging into bonds slowly, this is actually pretty good because
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   rates are rising.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.120]   You want yields to go up.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.000]   Now some considerations, asset location, again, you can't do this in an IRA or a 401(k).
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.360]   And I think the really big key is, you know, obviously it's probably worth going through
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.480]   some hassle of using that crappy government website because you're getting such a great
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.480]   deal, almost 10%.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   Again, it's six months, you know, annualized.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.760]   But you can't do it like automation.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.520]   So if you're worried about ease of investing, you want to just have it on autopilot, you
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   can't really do it that way.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.080]   But I think for that extra amount of yield, if you're earning five to four to five times
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.240]   amount of a U.S. treasury bond right now, that's a pretty good deal.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.660]   Obviously, that won't last forever if inflation comes in.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.720]   But as far as right now, it's not a bad deal.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.320]   One thing I will just mention that I was talking with Nick Magiuli about recently is some people
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.280]   have this weird authentication problem when you try to sign up.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.040]   I recently bought iBonds like six months ago.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.160]   And my wife, it said like, we need more information, and you have to send these forms and all this
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   kind of stuff.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   It happened to Nick, too.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   And apparently he was reading about it.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.540]   It happens to a lot of people.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.120]   And essentially, you're in limbo forever.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.680]   Like you can't actually get your account signed.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   I've heard this too.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   For me, it worked fine.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   But for some people, it won't.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.680]   I've heard that too.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.040]   You have to like go to a bank and get a note.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.480]   So again, this is a problem with ease of use and access.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.960]   It's not as easy as opening a Robinhood account and trading five minutes later.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.200]   It'll take a little bit of time to set up.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.400]   And I guess once you figure it out, it's probably easier, but that first time could be a problem
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   for people.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   Funny.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   Which of those is easier to do?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   Right?
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Yes.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   I know.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   Right.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   I'll do the next one.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   Okay.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   So up next, we have on a recent podcast, you mentioned that you went from being a saver
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   to being okay with spending.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.080]   I know you've mentioned it before, but how about an episode on it's okay to spend?
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.320]   I'm trying to get more comfortable with spending myself.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.920]   I have enough save to have a comfortable retirement, about $500,000 with 20 years to grow, but
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   I like saving.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.800]   I use tax deferred accounts and I don't have expensive taste.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.240]   I grew up poor and we never had enough money.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.360]   My wife grew up similarly and both our parents live off of social security and any little
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.040]   thing is an inconvenience.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.380]   How did you change your mindset to be more okay with spending?
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.960]   So someone on Twitter asked yesterday, what's your personal finance take that's going to
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960]   get you canceled?
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.760]   And mine was something along the lines of it's okay to spend your money and enjoy yourself
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   a little bit.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.520]   The people who tell you, who spend, shame you all the time and say, don't spend your
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   money.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.640]   Every little piece of your money here could be way more in the future.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   Just don't enjoy yourself at all.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   I think that's crazy.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   Actually, I think it was Ramit at I Will Teach You To Be Rich was the first one who really
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.160]   kind of taught me this.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.280]   And he said something along the lines of like spend extravagantly on the things you love
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   He's got a great book called I Will Teach You To Be Rich.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.560]   He's kind of been my personal finance mentor.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.520]   I actually had him on the show three years ago, it was pre-pandemic, right?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   A long time ago.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   It was before I actually worked here.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   Oh, it was that long?
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   Okay.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.520]   Maybe it was like four years ago.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.760]   So also I think part of, for me, I was always a big saver and I always was like penny pinching
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.160]   and saving from like a young age.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.800]   I think it was just kind of inherently in me.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.640]   Part of it was, you know, my upbringing, my parents, part of, I think it was just my personality.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.160]   But the older I got, the more I realized that like seeing the value of my portfolio go up
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.960]   didn't bring me nearly the same amount of satisfaction of, wait, spending a little extra
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.000]   to go on a trip this year.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.680]   Like what's going to bring me more regret?
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.920]   Not having a little bit more when I retire or actually enjoying myself a little bit now.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.080]   So I think the idea is once you automate your savings, then I think you can try to prioritize
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   your spending.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.640]   You don't have to have expensive tastes to spend money to make you happy.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.520]   Like my way of looking at it is I'm selectively cheap.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.920]   Like I like a nice high quality car that's like new-ish, but I don't drive luxury cars.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.040]   My wife and I don't really like to go to expensive dinners.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.460]   I prefer much rather to go to like a brewery and get a burger or something, you know.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.280]   We sell furniture in our house from like Ikea and Target and Talisman, which is a local
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.280]   West Michigan place here.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.040]   I love red wine, but it's hard to find me a bottle for more than $20 that I care to
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   buy.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   Right?
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   My wife loves Starbucks.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   She wants to get a Starbucks every day.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   Great.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   Get a Starbucks.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   I don't care.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   You know, that's a little thing.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.680]   For me, I used to go to the public library all the time to get books and I'd wait months
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.600]   for these books that were on hold and now it's like, wait a minute, what am I waiting
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.200]   four months to read this book for if it's $7.99?
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.260]   So every time like buy the book if you want.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.780]   So I also prefer to pay for things in the past that I would have done myself like for
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.780]   time.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.140]   So in the past I did all the lawn care at my house.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.500]   I shoveled the snow, all this stuff, cleaned the house and now we pay for someone to clean
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   the house and remove the snow and do the lawn care and all gladly stuff that I would have
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.660]   done myself in the past that I just would rather pay for time now.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.060]   So I have more time to spend with the kids and that sort of thing.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.860]   Obviously everyone is going to have their own spending categories that they care about,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.140]   but I think maybe you have to force yourself.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.480]   So if you're, you're a saver, cut out a piece of your budget, say every month $500, I'm
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.180]   going to spend guilt free on something new.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.180]   So pick one thing.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.740]   If you're going on a trip, pay up for first class, give it a try.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.160]   Try to go out to a nice restaurant, buy some expensive clothes, maybe buy your friends
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.160]   a round of drinks, right?
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   Stay in a nice luxury hotel.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.760]   Just try it once and see how it feels.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.600]   And then you can say, is this the kind of thing that's worth it to spend a little bit
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.920]   more on occasionally or do I not care?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.420]   Like you never know if you've never tried it before, especially if you've gone from
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.400]   an upbringing where you're always constantly hoarding money and worrying about, you know,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.720]   where that money is going to come next and living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.800]   So I think maybe if you've got your finances, you know, in line, try to like actually budget
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.320]   for it a little bit and force yourself.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   This is my guilt free spending.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   I'm going to blow it on something new every month and just try it.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.680]   Yeah, no, that's, that's good advice.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.760]   And yeah, some people, like you're saying, some people don't care and then other people,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.240]   it brings them a lot of joy in life, right?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   So yeah.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.700]   And so let's do this next question because I think this is a perfect example.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.580]   Okay, so this is a longer one, but an interesting one.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.440]   I've been a huge golfer for all my life and have always wanted to join one of the nicer
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.100]   golf clubs in our city.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.340]   The initiation fee for one of these clubs is between 70 and $100,000.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:02.300]   I had no idea it was this expensive, but it can be paid overtime interest free and the
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.140]   monthly dues are 500 to $750 a month.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.140]   You want to talk about inflation?
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.780]   I'm guessing with the amount of people golfing these days because of the pandemic, these
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.180]   prices have probably doubled what they were.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.940]   Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.500]   We're still early in our careers and not in a position to afford this kind of expense
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.500]   yet.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.140]   Are there any rules of thumb, percentage of income, net worth, monthly budget, et cetera,
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.820]   that you would suggest for determining when a big ticket expense is feasible?
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.660]   I want to wait until we're ready, but these fees are not set in stone.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.660]   Initiation was closer to 40 to $60,000 10 years ago.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.700]   I don't want to wait until our incremental readiness is eaten up by the increased fee.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.860]   For context, my wife and I currently save 60% of our income, have no debt except mortgage,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.020]   and max out all retirement options.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.740]   This would be our first major discretionary type of expense.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.740]   All right.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.740]   See, here's the thing.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.740]   I am personally not a golfer.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.740]   I hate golf.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.740]   I love golf, but I'm horrible at it.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.740]   See, that's the thing.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.580]   I'm horrible at it and I just never had the patience to put in the work.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.580]   My dad loves going.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.860]   He golfs three or four times a week in the summer.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.100]   I have a lot of friends who play golf.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.100]   Good for them.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.180]   If golf is your thing and you want to spend money on it, do it.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.180]   Guess what?
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.820]   I give this person permission.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.300]   Buy the damn golf membership.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.220]   You save 60% of your income, right?
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.340]   I guess you could make it a goal and say I'm going to carve out 10 or 20 or 30% and save
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.660]   up for that initiation fee, but if going to the golf course on a regular basis is going
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.260]   to make you happy, then do it.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.900]   Even if keeping up with those expenses is going to cause you to bring that savings rate
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.820]   down from 60 to 50 or 40, guess what?
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:36.660]   You're still better off savings rate-wise than 99% of the company.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.180]   This is your one big ticket splurge item.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.180]   I'm not going to spend shit.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.420]   You could have people who are going to judge you and say, "Did you hear how much they paid
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.420]   for that golf course?"
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   Who cares?
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.980]   If you're already saving in your maximum retirement accounts, do you really think you're going
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.860]   to regret this when you're 60?
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.860]   Here's the thing.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.100]   People save up for 40 years so they can go golfing one day when they retire.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.980]   If you can afford to do it now and you're still saving for retirement, maximum retirement
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.940]   accounts, do it.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.340]   I wouldn't overthink this.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.980]   I would figure out a way to make this happen because if this is really going to make you
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.420]   happy and this is your one thing and everything else you've got figured out and in line, that's
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.100]   the whole point of prioritizing.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.900]   Those memories that you're going to create golfing all the time, even though I would
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.100]   hate it personally, this person is going to enjoy it so much and have so much fun and
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.900]   have drinks and dinners and stuff there at the golf club and maybe a pool or something.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.900]   Do it.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.060]   I had a question about traveling a while back.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.100]   Is playing golf at age 70 more fun than playing golf at age 35?
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   Exactly.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.620]   The point is as long as you have your finances in order and you're saving already, then whatever
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.820]   you have left over, do whatever you want with it.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.460]   Then you can go crazy if you want.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.500]   You don't have to cut back everywhere else because you already know how to do that.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.160]   I do just wonder what you're paying for.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   That's a lot of money.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.340]   A golf course, whatever.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.340]   That's for another show.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.260]   It's prestige, Duncan.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.180]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.460]   It sounds really, really like a lot of money for a golf course.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.460]   It probably is.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.700]   I'm giving this permission.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.220]   If you want to do this, do it.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   All right.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.220]   Next question.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.220]   Okay.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.220]   I saw someone in the chat mentioned Topgolf.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.460]   You could just play Topgolf instead.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.460]   Okay.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:22.900]   So the next question is, I bought into a Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 fund as a lower risk
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.900]   investment.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   I'm nowhere near retirement age.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.120]   I'm 30 years old.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.860]   And I have no idea what will happen to this fund in 2025.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.940]   Does everything in the fund mature and get returned to shareholders?
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.060]   Does it continue in some other fashion?
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.780]   If so, should I cash out during the year?
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.620]   Is there a general rule for when you should exit a target date fund?
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   All right.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.620]   I have to admit, I have no idea of this either.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.780]   When I was reading this, I was like, "Oh, of course."
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.780]   And then I was like, "Oh, wait.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.780]   I actually don't know the answer to this."
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.780]   All right.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.780]   Good question.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.660]   And this is a good question because this is a younger investor.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.400]   Good question for one of our younger advisors, Ben Coulthard, who's been with Ritholtz probably
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   a year and a half.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   Hey, Ben.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.120]   He's the second most important Ben on our staff.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.420]   Now, I am a noted target date fan.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.860]   I'm a little taken aback that this person is 30 years old and investing in a 2025 fund.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.860]   Maybe they have a reason.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.180]   But why don't you school us on the point of investing in something like this, when it
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.880]   would make sense for a young person to invest in like this, and then how the whole target
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.280]   date funds thing works, like how the dates work because I think some people probably
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280]   don't even know.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   Yep.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.360]   I'm also taken aback by the 2025 target date fund, and I don't want to dunk on our guest
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.160]   here too much.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.320]   So I'll just answer it mechanically.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:38.280]   Currently, that fund is 55% stock, 45% bond, and it's not like it matures in the year 2025.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:45.000]   It just becomes like a 30% stock, 70% bond fund, assuming that you're now 68 years old
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   and you're in retirement.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Right.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.200]   Well, that's the way target date funds work, right?
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.560]   That date is supposed to be the day you retire.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.600]   And of course, when you retire, you're not just going to put all your money in cash because
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.320]   you could have two, three, four decades left to invest.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.640]   So they still have to invest in something, it's just going to be more conservative.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   Right.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   Right.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.600]   So like the viewer, I'm in my early 30s, and there are times to get conservative, right,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   for certain things.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.440]   But I'd ask him like anything in personal finance, like what this money's for, right?
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.720]   So if it's in his 401k, I have one reaction, and that is, "Come on, man.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.600]   I mean, why?
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.400]   You have 30 more years so you can even touch the money.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   Me too."
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.120]   Personally, I'm in 100% stocks, my 401k, I'm going to be adding to it every other week
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.760]   for the next three decades.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.520]   So why on earth would I have 40% bonds, let alone four?
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   Right.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.160]   So yeah, someone of that age, if they're in a 401k, they should be in a 2060 or 2065 fund
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.160]   or something, right?
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.160]   Something much further out.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   Exactly.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.520]   So the Target Date 2060 fund is 90% stocks, 10% bonds.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.920]   So if that's what it's for, if you're just looking to set this on autopilot, Target Date
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.920]   funds are great.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.480]   You don't even have to do any guesswork.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.560]   It does all the rebalancing for you.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.400]   But I'm going to assume that that's not the goal here, because there is a great, I would
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.160]   say, reason to hold something like this.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.360]   And that's if you have a three to five year down payment goal or something, which I do
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   have.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.120]   I don't have a set date on it.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.860]   It could be three, it could be six years, but I can't have that just sitting in cash
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.520]   and just getting eaten away, but I can't YOLO it into the markets either.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.720]   So I'm actually using a 50/50 allocation fund for whether it's two years a place pops up,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.160]   five years, maybe I get a little bit more.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.080]   But yeah, I would say it, like anything, it comes down to what the money's for.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.600]   And as for the viewer, if you're listening right now, shoot Duncan another email.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.240]   I'm happy to hop on the phone personally, because this is a conversation, right?
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.480]   It's hard to know what this money's for and give the right advice.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.480]   I do agree with you.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.560]   If you have a shorter term time horizon, picking a shorter term target date fund actually makes
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   sense.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.680]   So you're starting to save right now for a house down payment and you pick a 2025 or
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   2030 fund.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.960]   It actually kind of makes sense because you can put an end date on your fund when it's
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.280]   going to have that glide path to get more conservative.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Right.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.360]   So even like for like a college goal, like I would imagine, you know, this 30 year old
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.880]   doesn't have a 15 year old kid, that'd be pretty gnarly.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.920]   That's going to be in college in a couple of years, but like for a parent, you know,
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.000]   your kids coming in five years, like I think it would be a great solution for that.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Yes.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Guess what my kids 529 plans are in?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Target date funds.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Come on.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Exactly.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Of course.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.440]   At some point this show is going to be sponsored by a target date fund, right?
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.600]   Like an individual one.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.280]   Can we have like one target date fund sponsor us?
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   It should be.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   All right.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   I'll do the next one.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   Awesome.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.960]   Also, Giancarlo in the chat says Benny sort of looks like Matt Stafford.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   Interesting.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   I'll take that.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   I'll take that.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.480]   LA Rams Matt Stafford or Detroit Lions Matt Stafford?
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.640]   There's a difference there.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   Good question.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   Okay.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   Up next.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.480]   How should I think about investing for the long term if I also want to speculate or gamble
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.720]   in the short term?
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.160]   What amount of my portfolio should I dedicate to these different approaches?
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.440]   So we talked earlier about me changing from a saving all the time to having some spending
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   in there.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440]   This is probably something I've changed my mind to.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.320]   I've written about this before, how I have 10% of my portfolio is just kind of for fun.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.360]   I have it in a Robin Hood account and some alternatives and stuff, and I think scratching
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.480]   that itch makes sense.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.520]   Ben, I think this is something that younger people probably have more of a desire for
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.000]   than their parents may have.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.840]   So what do you think is a good starting place for this?
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.940]   Do you think younger people want or need to have this more than older generations?
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.160]   And how do you go about doing this in a way that you're not just going to blow yourself
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.120]   up and lose a bunch of money that you really need?
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.920]   Well, I'm going to give the Ben Carlson blog answer, which is that again, it depends on
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   everyone.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.440]   I mean, there are 68 year olds that love to buy some individual stocks, some alt coins
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   and whatnot.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.120]   But I do think when you're younger, you have 40 years to make up the income if you blow
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.760]   something up.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.840]   So the Robin Hood culture, I mean, every other commercial on the Super Bowl was gambling.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.880]   So I think there is that kind of, you have Stuhl Presidente throwing out all of his picks,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   you have all that stuff.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.400]   So I'm just going to answer this personally again, because investing and gambling are
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.880]   two of my favorite things, but they're similar but different.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.560]   So I started out like most people, I read the Intelligent Investor, I read Buffett shareholder
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.500]   letters, Peter Lynch, and I think I'm ready to be the next Bill Ackman.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.980]   So much so in fact, that my first stock purchase was Valiant Pharmaceuticals.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.100]   I had seen that it went down from like $300 to $30.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.860]   I read over the weekend in Barron's that Bill Ackman was joining the board as if that's
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.700]   some kind of secret inside information, like the whole world wasn't reading it.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.740]   So I buy it, it instantly pops to like $40.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.240]   I'm going around the office bragging how I'm up already, which that's another thing, don't
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.500]   flex on your investments because you're only giving yourself bad karma if that exists.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.540]   And then I ended up looking like an idiot when I sold it at 20.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:55.700]   So there's that, then my next purchase was Apple, which was the same quarter that Warren
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.220]   Buffett initiated his position.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.400]   Too bad on like Warren Diamond hands, I sold it nine months later because I saw like a
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.800]   scary election headline or something.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.820]   So I guess meanwhile, like my 401k is just kind of plodding along and index funds, my
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.180]   sidecar account is going like this.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.260]   The beauty of the sidecar account, the play account, the gambling account, whatever you
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.260]   want to call it, is that you can scratch that itch, right?
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.000]   You play out your idiot ideas without blowing yourself up.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.700]   And I don't care if you're taking Tiger Woods to win the masters or you're buying Tiger
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:34.060]   King coin, which is a real thing that I read on the internet this week.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.860]   The key is to size it appropriately.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.060]   I have 80% of my net worth in index funds because I'm happy to bend the knee to the
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   market.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.300]   I would buy Nike King and Jon Snow if they had a kid.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.580]   One of the few guarantees in investing, there's very limited guarantees, but one of the few
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.620]   ones is that you are guaranteed to own a future winner.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.980]   You don't have to worry about picking Amazon, it'll just pop right up in the index and you'll
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   own it.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:02.080]   The other 20% is where I get my thrills, a little Nvidia here, some Tesla there, dabble
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:08.140]   in some Solana, throw $100 on the Patriot spread, which actually when we had Tom Brady,
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.940]   that dollar cost averaging the Patriot spread, that was an investment.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.940]   That is not gambling.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.620]   The other thing is, the other good thing about this is you can use it as a comparison.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.420]   So in 2020, you're looking at your sidecar investments, you're going, "I'm a genius.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.660]   Why am I holding index funds?"
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.180]   And then 2021 and on, you're saying, "Oh God, thank God that I hold these index funds still."
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.780]   And it's a way to keep yourself in check a little bit to realize like, "Oh, that one
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.740]   year of really awesome returns does not mean that I should put all of my money into this
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.740]   and go crazy."
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.740]   Exactly.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:44.980]   I think the problem with that whole 2020, 2021 madness is people did put way too much.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.820]   And you hear about the guy who concentrated everything in Tesla and turned a hundred grand
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.940]   into 2 million.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.940]   That's the survivorship bias.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.160]   You have all the other people that blew themselves up.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.420]   So just size it appropriately.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.820]   Look at it as like going to the movies.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.380]   I put $50 on the Rangers game the other night.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.300]   I was on the edge of my seat the whole game.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.980]   I might as well have been at the game screaming and yelling.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.700]   The bet did hit, so that's great.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.500]   But if it didn't, whatever, I owe $50.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.660]   We only talk losers here, not winners.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.660]   I know.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.660]   I definitely have losers.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.660]   I definitely have losers.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.260]   I bought Roblox at $100 and then again at $80 and sold it at $50.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.420]   There's no stories in the New York Times about the guy who YOLOed his life savings into Dogecoin
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.860]   when Elon Musk was on SNL and now he's down 80%.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.540]   You don't see those ones on the other side of it.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.540]   Exactly.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.580]   And I think it's almost like a camaraderie thing.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.060]   The group chats with my friends, they're all, "Yeah, are you on the Packers this weekend?
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.180]   Did you buy Shibu Inu?"
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.180]   Whatever.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.180]   It's fun stuff.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.180]   Just size it appropriately.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.180]   I do think it's...
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.700]   They say successful investing should be like watching paint dry and that's fine, but it's
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.140]   okay to be entertained and have a little bit of that other stuff too if you're going to
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.420]   enjoy it and if you just like following this stuff because it's interesting.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420]   Because it is.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.220]   The markets are so interesting to watch.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.220]   It is.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.820]   A lot of young people would tell you, "Have fun being poor," right?
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.820]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.820]   I don't care.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.820]   And guess what?
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.820]   I am having fun being poor and losing $50.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   I haven't heard much about that.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.660]   I think a lot of people are having fun being poor who are saying that.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660]   Exactly.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.660]   And you know what?
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.060]   I don't want to rub it in on people, but yeah, they should have sized it appropriately.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   That's it.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.620]   Can I quickly tell my intelligent investor story?
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   Please.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.500]   I read it back many years ago and I immediately went out and bought a bunch of close-in funds
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.540]   because he talks so much about close-in funds.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.900]   Did you also buy railroad stocks because that's what he was talking about as well?
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.460]   I looked at them, but I didn't.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.460]   I stuck with CEFs.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.860]   It's kind of funny what that book does to people.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.860]   Okay.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.820]   But yeah, I think a lot of dyed-in-the-wool bogleheads would say, "You're an idiot.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.820]   Why would you ever do this?
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.900]   Just put it on autopilot and forget it."
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.460]   I think for some people that's fine and they can do that, but other people that need to
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.220]   scratch that itch and have that release, if it allows you to leave the rest of your portfolio
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.260]   alone, then I think it's serving a purpose.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.260]   Exactly.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.260]   Exactly.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   Great.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   All right.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.260]   I want to thank Benny Markets for joining me today.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.260]   Thanks for having me.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.660]   Appreciate it.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.180]   Duncan and I will be back next week with Nick Majulie, who's going to be pushing his new
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.180]   book.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.180]   Right.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.180]   Just keep buying.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.180]   Right.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.740]   Keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.380]   If you want us to put the ticker back on, we will.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.380]   Just put it in the questions and comments here.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.340]   Yeah, just tell us if you want that clock ticking back next week and we'll make sure
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.340]   we oblige.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:30.060]   If you have a question, askthecombancho@gmail.com and for your summer merch needs, Duncan just
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.220]   did a total overhaul of idontshop.com.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.180]   We have Portfolio Rescue towels now, which I'm going to be using at the beach this summer.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.180]   Right.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.700]   We have a new t-shirt, a white hoodie now.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.380]   It's looking good.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.380]   Duncan did a good job on that.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   We did it for summer.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.380]   It's a summer shop now.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.380]   All right.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.380]   idontshop.com.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.380]   We will see you next time.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:47.380]   Thanks.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:47.880]   Bye.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.380]   Bye.

[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   Bye.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.380]   Bye.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.040]   (upbeat music)
