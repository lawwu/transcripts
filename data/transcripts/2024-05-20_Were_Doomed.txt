[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.900]   Catch a baseball game at Coors Field.

[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.200]   Denver. Always welcome.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.900]   Plan your trip at visitdenver.com/summer.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200]   A show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.300]   and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.700]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.200]   I'm your host. Today, we are going to discuss something fun.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.700]   National debt. Five years ago,
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.300]   I released a couple of podcasts. Podcast episodes 628 called Federal Debt.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.700]   The Ticking Bomb That No One Is Willing To Diffuse.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.100]   And number 629, in-depth version, Federal Debt.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.900]   The Ticking Bomb That No One Is Willing To Diffuse.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.700]   And in those podcasts, I gave, especially in 629, the in-depth version,
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.100]   I gave an extensive, detailed discussion of all of the factors affecting the U.S.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.900]   national fiscal situation, the growing debt, the never-ending deficit.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.500]   We went through all the details and, sorry, all of the numbers in painful detail.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.200]   We talked about how all of the things that people talk about this.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.800]   Hey, there's some easy solution that will have strong economic growth is nonsense.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.700]   That we could just inflate the debt away. Nonsense. Low interest rates.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000]   You know, we're going to keep the interest rates low. Nonsense. Immigration.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.100]   Let's fix it. Nonsense. All the conservative fantasies.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.000]   We talked about how, hey, let's have a pro-growth tax policy.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.900]   And we said that federal programs are growing a 66 or 7% annually.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.400]   So you have to exceed that in order to do some kind of deficit reduction.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.200]   We talked about the conservative fantasy of,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.800]   hey, let's eliminate welfare and lower priority spending.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   We talked about how deep the cuts would have to be. It's just laughably deep.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.300]   It's a delusion to think that that could happen.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.700]   Impossibly tight spending caps. Devolution to state governments.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900]   And we talked about the liberal fantasies. Let's just tax the rich.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.900]   And we talked about what would happen if you had a 100% tax on all income over $500,000.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.700]   We talked about the delusions of saying,
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500]   hey, let's do deep defense cuts or single-payer health care.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200]   And just talked about how insane everything would be.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.400]   Now, so I told you five years ago, I said, here's what you need to listen for.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.600]   You need to listen for serious, serious discussion on these topics.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.100]   And I don't think it will happen. I don't think it'll happen.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.200]   Let me play for you just a few minutes.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.100]   This is from episode 629, from the conclusion of episode 629,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.400]   published on March 7, 2019.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.500]   Liberal. Read those. Conclusion.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   For decades, economists and policy experts warned
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   that a budgetary and economic tsunami would come
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.100]   when the 74 million baby boomers retire into Social Security and Medicare.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   Nevertheless, a parade of presidents
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.900]   and congresses did nothing to avert the crisis.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.900]   To the contrary, both parties added a new Medicare drug entitlement in 2003,
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.300]   after which the Affordable Care Act further expanded federal health obligations
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.700]   for Medicaid and new subsidized health insurance exchanges.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.900]   Today, one-third of the baby boomers have already retired,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.400]   and another one-third will retire over the next six years.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.500]   Annual budget deficits will soon pass $1 trillion on the way to $2 trillion,
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.100]   and possibly $3 trillion in 10 to 15 years.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.300]   Overall, the Social Security and Medicare systems
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.400]   face an unfathomable $100 trillion cash deficit over 30 years.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.200]   Without reform, runaway deficits will all but guarantee a debt crisis
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.000]   that will profoundly damage the country's economic and social order.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   There is still time to avoid that crisis,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500]   but it will require the nation's fractious political leaders
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.200]   to leave their respective comfort zones and compromise.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:44.100]   Now, before we continue, let's go to the U.S. House of Representatives just this week,
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.800]   and let me play you a three-minute audio clip.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.500]   It's necessary that I give you the context.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.200]   So here's the context from a USA Today article on what I'm about to play for you.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.500]   and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat from New York,
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.300]   butted heads at a House Oversight Committee markup session Thursday night
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.200]   after Greene attacked Representative Jasmine Crockett, Democrat from Texas,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.400]   saying she was wearing "fake eyelashes."
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.100]   The meltdown began as lawmakers were discussing the issue
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.200]   of holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.000]   for refusing to release audio recordings of President Joe Biden's interview
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   with Special Counsel Robert Herr.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.600]   Herr released a scathing report earlier this year that described Biden as a
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.200]   "well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory."
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Now, let's listen to the audio.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.700]   As far as I can tell, this is a three-minute and ten-second audio clip
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.800]   that I believe is unedited.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.300]   - I'd like to know if any of the Democrats on this committee
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.100]   are employing Judge Mershawn's daughter.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.300]   - This is Greene speaking, Representative Greene.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.000]   - Please tell me what that has to do with Merrick Garland.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.600]   - Is she a porn star?
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.800]   - Oh, Goldman. That's right. He's advising.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.300]   - Okay.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.000]   - He's advising who?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.600]   - Do you know what we're here for? You know we're here about AG?
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.800]   - I don't think you know what you're here for.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.300]   - Well, you're the one talking about—
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.500]   - I think your fake eyelashes are messing up—
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.600]   - No, ain't nothing— - Hold on, hold on.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.800]   - Order, Mr. Chairman. Would you order the regaining order of your committee?
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.100]   - I do have a point of order, and I would like to move to take down Ms. Greene's words.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.100]   That is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person?
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.400]   - Are your feelings hurt? - Move her words down.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   - Aw. - Oh, oh, girl. Baby girl.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.300]   - Oh, really? - Don't even play with me.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.100]   - Baby girl? I don't think so. - We are going to move, and we're going to take your words down.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.000]   - I second that motion.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.500]   - So, so, who will have to pay?
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.700]   - Ms. Greene agrees to strike her words.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.100]   - I believe she's apologizing. - No, no, no, Mr. Perry—
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.300]   - Okay, hold on. Then, after Mr. Perry's going to be recognized, then Ms. Greene—
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.900]   - I'm not apologizing. - Well, then, you're not striking your words.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.200]   - I am not apologizing. - Now, let's go. Come on, guys.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.800]   - Why don't you debate me? - Mr. Chairman, um, the, the minority—
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.900]   - I think it's pretty self-evident. - You're not—
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.200]   - Yeah, you're not—you don't have enough intelligence. - You're out of order.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   - You're out of order. Chair recognizes Mr. Perry.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.900]   - Okay, move to strike the— - I'd like to strike those words as well.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.100]   - I'd move to strike the lady's words. - I would like to strike those words as well.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.000]   - That's two requests to strike. That's two requests to strike.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.100]   - Oh, they cannot take the words. - If there's another motion to strike your words again,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.400]   please get your members under control. - All right, okay, here's the correct apology.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.300]   Ms. Greene, do you ask unanimous—do you agree to unanimous consent to strike your words?
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.900]   - I repeat again for the second time, yes, I'll strike my words, but I'm not apologizing.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.300]   - Without objection. - Not apologizing.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.500]   - Mr. Chair, point of order.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.800]   - Who's—who's— - It's me. - Ms. Crockett.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.500]   - I'm just curious, just to better understand your ruling,
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.900]   if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach-blind,
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.200]   bad-built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.100]   - A what now?
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.400]   - Chairman, I make a motion to strike those words.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   - I don't think that's a part of it. - I'm trying to find clarification on what—
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.600]   - Chairman, motion to strike those words. - I had no idea what you just said.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.200]   - We're not gonna—we're not gonna do this. Look, you guys earlier literally just said—
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.000]   - You just—you just voted to do it. You just voted to do it.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.300]   - Order, order. - I'm trying to get clarification.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.600]   - Look it, calm down, calm down. - No, no, no, no, because this is what y'all do.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.200]   - So I'm trying to get clarification. - Hey, Ms. Crockett, you're not recognized.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.400]   - Ms. Crockett. - And you don't want me to be— - I can't hear you with your yelling.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   - Calm down. Can you please calm down? - No, don't tell me to calm down,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.600]   because y'all talk noise, and then you can't take it. - You're out of control.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.100]   - 'Cause if I come and talk shit about her, y'all gonna have a problem.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.900]   - Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman. - Order. - All right, Chair—OK.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.400]   - Order, Chair now— - So that's from a couple days ago, a few days ago.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   And I made a mistake there. I did see—find a cut in the middle there.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.300]   So that wasn't the unedited audio. That was clipped together audio.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   So I apologize for stating that wrongly.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.200]   I now want to go back to episode 629. After I finish that conclusion,
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.400]   I want you to listen carefully to the next segment from episode 629 from 2019.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.100]   Remembering, by the way, that at the time, we said six years would pass.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.600]   Another third of the baby boomers would retire.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.200]   We're now at about 60% of baby boomers have retired. Here we are five years later.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.300]   Let's now listen to the comments that I made at the end of this podcast.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:40.300]   "And thus endeth the paper."
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.500]   I hope that you made it through, and apologies for burying you with the data,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.500]   with all the numbers. I know it's hard in an audio format,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.700]   but it's important, and I want you to pay attention to it.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.800]   And I decided to go ahead and bury you with two hours of data and policy wonk discussion
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.600]   because I thought it was well done. I thought it was fairly balanced,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.200]   but I thought it did a good job of showing the basic problem.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   I don't see a solution for the macro economy.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.600]   I don't see a solution for the macro budget, et cetera.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.800]   To think that — and here's just one more comment.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.300]   I've inserted, of course, a lot of commentary. I didn't intend to,
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.600]   but I'm a talk show host. I can't help it.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.900]   Just even the closing point. There is still time to avoid that crisis,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.200]   but it will require the nation's fractious political leaders
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.900]   to leave their respective comfort zones and compromise.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.400]   The biggest reason why I think that is impossible is, from my observation,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:52.000]   it seems to me that political leaders have stopped trusting one another,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.900]   and I think they have good reason to stop trusting one another.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.100]   If I were in politics, I would have a very hard time believing
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:07.300]   that I'm negotiating in good faith with another politician.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.700]   I think there are political leaders who would be willing to negotiate these things
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.500]   if they believed that the opposition was in good faith.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.400]   I think most adults, especially adults who have a little bit of experience,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.900]   recognize that in life you don't always get what you want.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   Sometimes you get what you need. You don't always get what you want.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   And so, although I would argue for a hardline position,
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.800]   all of us, even when we argue for a hardline position,
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.300]   we would concede that I can't get there overnight,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.100]   and in fact it's not good for me to get there overnight.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.700]   Almost any person in almost any issue that you look at
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:53.800]   who would make a hardline argument would concede that you need time for things to adjust.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.400]   But how much trust would you have, if you were a political leader,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.900]   that your opposition is in good faith?
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.700]   I don't think anybody on any side of the political issue thinks
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   that their opponents are acting in good faith.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.700]   I've tried to read activists on all sides of the political debate,
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.900]   and what I observe in my reading is nobody thinks the other side is genuine.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.000]   Nobody thinks they're acting in good faith.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.400]   And I think everybody has substantial evidence that would say that they're right.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.100]   I don't know about you, but those maniacs yelling at each other,
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.700]   I think should be considered as pretty decent evidence.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.100]   One hardcore lefty, other hardcore righty, absolute maniacs.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.200]   Let's continue. Being of the more conservative political bent,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   the more freedom-oriented political bent,
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.700]   I would like to believe that my side is better,
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.600]   but I would have to concede that that could just be my own desire to see that confirmed.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.300]   I think it might be true, but I see enough that I can understand how people
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.700]   who would be a night and day different from me would say you're not acting in good faith.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.100]   I can see that. So what do I have to defend?
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.200]   So if you can't even trust on the simplest of issues that your opponents are going to act
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.500]   in good faith, they're going to speak in good faith,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   and they're going to debate in good faith on the simple issues.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.600]   How on earth do you solve something as complex as this budget nightmare?
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:37.700]   I don't know about you, but kind of a simple issue to deal with a current thing in a subcommittee.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.300]   How do you then deal with a budget nightmare that requires everyone to compromise?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:48.900]   Back to the tape. How do you get there?
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.200]   Now, I hope I'm wrong. I desperately hope I'm wrong.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.600]   Because friends, we don't want to go through a budget, an economic crisis.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.400]   It is a nightmare. It is a nightmare. We don't want to do it.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.500]   It is not. If it's your fantasy that you think,
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.700]   "Well, there's going to be no rule of law. Without rule of law,
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.100]   I'm going to be able to do what I want." Nonsense. It is a nightmare.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.300]   It is an absolute nightmare. We don't want to go through it.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:22.500]   It will be pain, depression, dissolution, suicide on all hands, death on all sides,
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.800]   massive decline in lifestyle, massive decline in safety,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.200]   massive increase in violence and the risk of violence.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   You don't want to go through it. I don't want to go through it.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.400]   So I desperately hope I'm wrong. And if I can find evidence that says that I'm wrong,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:49.200]   I will share that with you. But at this point, the data seems pretty clear.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.500]   And when I add all the little bits that I've inserted here into what I've already shared with you,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   I don't see how a political solution is possible.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.500]   I do not see it. I hope I'm wrong again. I don't see it.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:11.300]   Now, let's talk about, well, I'll share one more thing.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:20.700]   How's this one? So we've got a bunch of maniacs in Congress.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:27.000]   We've got a couple of senile guys running for president who are both whacked out,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.500]   haven't made any progress over the last five years really at all on any of these financial issues.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.300]   Things are much more dire than they ever were. And since five years have been wasted,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.600]   this isn't even a part of the public debate. We're not even talking about it.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.900]   There's no serious good faith debate. When Donald Trump and President Biden debate each other,
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.500]   if they do in the coming months in the run up to the elections,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.700]   I'm not expecting a deep discussion on national debt and fiscal deficit and everything like that.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.000]   But let's flip to another one. I thought this was pretty good.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.700]   This is from Reddit, from the teachers subreddit. The headline of the post.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:11.800]   Ninth graders protested against taking the Algebra 1 state exam. Admin has no clue what to do.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.900]   Students are required to take and pass this exam as a graduation requirement.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.300]   There is also a push to have as much of the school testing as possible in order to receive a school grade.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.300]   I believe it is about 95 percent attendance required. Otherwise, they are unable to give one.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   The ninth graders have vocally announced that they are refusing to take part in state testing anymore.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.900]   Many students decided to feign sickness, skip or stay home.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.000]   But the ones in school decided to hold a sit-in outside the media center and refused to go in,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.600]   waiting out until the test is over. Admin has tried every approach to get them to go and take the test.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.900]   They tried yelling, begging, bribing with pizza, warnings that they will not graduate,
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:55.600]   threats to call parents and have them suspended, and more to get these kids to go and nothing worked.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.800]   They were only met with "I don't care" and many expletives.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.100]   While I do not teach Algebra 1 this year, I found it hilarious watching from the window,
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.400]   as the administrators were completely at their wits' end dealing with the complete apathy,
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.000]   disrespect and outright malicious nature of the students we have been reporting and writing up all year.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.900]   We have kids we haven't seen in our classrooms since January,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.300]   out in the halls and causing problems for other teachers, with nothing being done about it.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.200]   Students that curse us out on the daily return to the classroom with treats and a smirk on their face,
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.800]   knowing they got away with it. It has only emboldened them to take things further.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:36.900]   We received the report at the end of the day that we had only 60% of our students take the Algebra 1 exam,
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:44.100]   out of hundreds of freshmen. We only have a week left in school, counting down the days.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.900]   So I don't know what to say.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:53.500]   I just thought this whole set of affairs was funny in a sad and horrific kind of sense.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.200]   Here's your black pill for the day.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:05.000]   What I would encourage you is simply, if you're interested, go back to Episode 628 or 629.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.400]   I would suggest 629, the in-depth version, where I go through all the numbers of the fiscal deficit.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:19.500]   And at this point in time, I don't see, I continue to not see that there's any even proposal,
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:30.200]   any proposal whatsoever, point out to me any proposal for stabilizing and improving the U.S. fiscal situation.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.800]   It's absolutely horrific. Now, none of us knows what that actually will mean.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:41.900]   It's completely uncharted territory for a government like the United States to be on the track that it's on.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.100]   We can see what has happened in some other countries that have done similar things.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.300]   None of them are at the scale of the United States, and none of us have any idea.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.500]   So who knows? Maybe it could be an absolute catastrophe.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.200]   Maybe not. After all, the United States is not Zimbabwe.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:03.300]   The United States is not Venezuela. But pay attention. Pay attention.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:09.700]   Politics ain't going so well right now, and I think you should pay attention to that.
