[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   According to the Bible, the appointed time has grown very short.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Jesus calls us to watch for His return. Why?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   For you know neither the day nor the hour.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Christ's return is imminent and His timeline makes us urgent.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And given the urgency of the time, how then shall we live our daily lives?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   It's a question every generation of Christians has asked
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and one John Piper raised and answered in his 2004 sermon
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   on Jesus' parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Here's a clip of what John Piper said.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Parables are like that.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Sometimes the people of God are portrayed as the bride
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   and sometimes they are portrayed as those preparing for the marriage.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   If you press the details of parables, everything goes haywire in the New Testament.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Parables are meant to communicate one main point
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and the main point here is a people of God are being instructed
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   about how to get ready to meet the bridegroom.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   The bride doesn't even show up in this parable.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   But we may then collapse it into other teachings and say,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   "Okay, we treat this as the bride even though they are ten virgins
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   leading the bridegroom into the bridal chamber."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So don't stumble over these details.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Go for the main central thing.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Verse 2, "Five of them were foolish, five were wise.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps."
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   All ten of them had a job to do.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   They had lamps.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   The lamps were supposed to be ready, ignited.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   When he comes, light.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Prepare the way of the Lord.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   He's coming.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Light your lamps.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Bring them in.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's their job.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   This is a job.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   This is these ten women have a job to do and they're supposed to be ready to do it.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   That's the situation.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Oil in the lamps is part of the means by which they get their job done.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   If they don't have oil for their lamps,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   they are neglecting the means appointed for them to do their work.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   They're supposed to shine with light and five of them are foolish.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   They are not taking seriously their calling to give light.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   They're neglecting the only means by which their lamps can do any good.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What good's a lamp in that culture?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   What good's a lamp which got no oil to burn so it can make light?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Their job was provide light when he comes and they go off candles without wicks, as it were.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Light bulbs with no electricity, lamps with no sufficient oil, torches with no fire.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   They liked their position.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   They could have left if they didn't like it.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   They liked being lamp carriers.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I have a lamp.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I have a lamp.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I have a shiny lamp.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   With no attention to its emptiness.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Their foolishness was to think that mere religious form was sufficient.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Their foolishness was to think that power for light can be borrowed in the last minute.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Ever heard anybody talk about getting saved like that?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'll just wait.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'll just wait.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's really dangerous.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Verse 5, "As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Notice two things.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Jesus tells us ahead of time there's going to be a delay between the comings.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   This has been a stumbling block for 2,000 years, right?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   This has been a stumbling block for people for 2,000 years.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh yeah, right, Jesus, King, came, right?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He brought the kingdom.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Yeah, where is He?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Remember how Peter dealt with this in his second letter?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   They will say, "Where is the promise of His coming?"
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then He responds like this, "But do not overlook this one fact, beloved,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Two days have passed since Jesus left.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   "The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise, as some count slowness,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   but He is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   but that all should come to repentance."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Jesus told us in advance there would be a delay.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Verse 5, "The bridegroom was delayed."
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And the second thing to notice is this, "All ten slept, not just the foolish."
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Which means that sleep in this parable is not negative.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Don't say, "Oh, the teaching of this parable is watch,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   because you don't know the day or the hour, so don't sleep."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Well, that's wrong.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   The wise virgins slept, which means sleep signifies normal, ordinary, day in, day out life
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   of doing what you've got to do and sleeping when you get tired,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   getting up, doing what you've got to do, sleeping when you get tired,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   getting up, doing what you've got to do, going to bed, get the rest you need,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   get up, do what you've got to do.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   This little word, "They all slept," means what God expects of us in this period of time
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   between the engagement and the marriage is do your duty and get the rest you need to do it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I remember growing up, and we've got all kinds of Second Coming stuff going on around us,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and movies and books.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I remember a movie when I was growing up, I forget the name of it,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Thief in the Night or something, you know, and as the movie closed,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   there was this text read, "Watch, for you know neither the day or the hour,"
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and a woman went over and pulled the curtain back and went like this.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   That is absolutely wrong.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's wrong because it put the interpretation, "Watch," on looking up.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   This is why people have sold their goods, gone to the top of mountains and waited
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   because they've got some sun.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   "Watch" is taken to mean be gazing up into the clouds.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You know what "watch" means?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Go to bed at 10 instead of 12.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   That's what it means because if you don't, you will be sluggish spiritually in the morning
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and the devil will nail you at 10 o'clock.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   "Watch" means be alert, be vigilant, do what you've got to do in your ordinary life
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   to stay attuned to the living God and be in the Word without falling asleep.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   How do you do your devotions without falling asleep?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Turn the television off and get to bed.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   This is a text about live sober, ordinary, duty-performing lives
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   so that when He comes, He will find you so doing.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   What do you want to be found doing when He comes?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Staring in the sky?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Deliver me.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I want to be at a bedside loving a sick person.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I want to be in the city working for the poor.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I want to be in the pulpit, God willing, preaching a sermon.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I don't want to be staring into the sky like that's some godly thing to do.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Oh, that we might be found doing the works of righteousness when He comes
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   and sleeping after a nice hard day of well-done work.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That would be a nice way to meet Him.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Verse 6, "But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here's the bridegroom, come out to meet Him.'"
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Now relate that to 1 Thessalonians 4.16,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God."
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   So here He says, "The cry goes out, 'He's here, go meet Him.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Let your lamps burn brightly with life, joy, faith, hope, love, expectancy,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   praise, wonder, marvel.'"
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   This is going to happen, folks.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Jesus is going to come back someday.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Are you ready?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Do you have oil in the form of your religion?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Life, faith, hope, love, reality?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Or are you just carrying your formal little lamp around?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I go to church.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I carry a Bible.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I pray before meals.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I try to keep the Ten Commandments.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Your little lamp, and inside, nothing of spiritual affections for God,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   love for the bridegroom, an intense expectancy that it's going to be better
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   when He comes than the best sex you ever had or the best food you ever had
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   or the best success you ever had.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   No life like that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He says it like it is.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   That clip was taken from John Piper's 2004 sermon on Matthew 25 titled
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   "Jesus Christ, the Bridegroom, Past and Future."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The clip was sent in to us by Tiana in Semi Valley, California.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Thank you, Tiana, for the clip.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And speaking of Jesus, speaking of His life, how did He learn obedience
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and how did Jesus become perfect?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   There are some really mysterious texts in the New Testament about the spiritual
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   maturing of Jesus on earth.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So how did He mature if He never sinned?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It's a great question.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John Podcast with longtime pastor
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and author John Piper.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I'm your host Tony Ranke, and we'll see you then.
