[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   We have an email from Loretta, who lives in London, and she asks, "Pastor John, do
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.620]   you think technology is threatening the submission of a congregation to their
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.800]   pastor, in that people have so many choices of online teachers?" Well, first
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   let me affirm her concern. I really appreciate anyone who wants to highlight
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   the biblical conviction that pastors are leaders by God's appointment and should
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.760]   be biblically followed. Hebrews 13, 17, "Obey your leaders, submit to them, they
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.560]   are keeping watch over your souls." They're gonna have to give an account.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.360]   Let them do this with joy and not groaning, because that's no advantage to
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.040]   you. So this beautiful portrayal of happy pastors doing their work with joy, and
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.080]   people happily supporting, that's right. She should be concerned about that. Or
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.780]   1 Thessalonians 5, "We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.400]   you and are over you in the Lord." They're your leaders, they're over you, they've
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.680]   been put by God in a place of authority and spiritual leadership, and you
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.240]   should respect them and esteem them highly for their work, for love's sake. So
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.560]   yes to the concern. Now that raises the question, what does submission mean and
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.800]   what does it not mean? And then we can ask how does the Internet affect
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.760]   that? Because submission to a pastor or a group of elders does not mean the pastor
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.320]   is infallible, or the pastor is the ultimate authority. The Bible is the
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.400]   ultimate authority and is infallible, not the pastor, not the elders. And it
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   doesn't mean that you believe everything he says without examining it, but rather
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.480]   you go to the book of Acts and you see in Acts 17 that the Bereans were more
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.760]   noble than those in Thessalonica because they examined the scriptures daily to
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.360]   see if these things were so when an apostle was speaking to them. So it's not
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.280]   wrong for a people to love their pastor and submit to their pastor and still
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.760]   make sure that from the Bible what he is saying and how he's leading squares up
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.840]   with scripture. So positively I would say that that submission to pastoral
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.180]   authority involves respecting them, having a high esteem for their office
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.680]   and calling, giving them the benefit of the doubt, not becoming cynical and
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.560]   skeptical about things that they say, supporting their plans and their
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.800]   vision for the church, throwing yourself into the life of the church in any way
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.320]   you can without sinning. In other words, your basic disposition towards the
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.640]   leadership is, "Yes! Let's go! Let's support them!" just like a wife's basic
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.320]   disposition towards her husband should be, "I just love it when you lead! Any way I
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.400]   can support your leadership that's not sinful, I'm gonna be right there by your
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.960]   side supporting you." I think that's the way we should feel about our
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.640]   our pastors. Now, the Internet, with all of its teachers out there that people can
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.120]   listen to, is one more step in people's access to truth other than their
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.880]   preacher. And error too, but truth I'm thinking right now. So I'm thinking when
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.920]   I say one more step, the first step was translating the Bible into a language
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.000]   they could read, and that got some of them burned at the stake. The
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.600]   pastoral authority was so threatened, "If you read your English Bible, I'm gonna
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.080]   burn you at the stake," and they did. And the next would be books and
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.160]   magazines, the next would be radio, the next would be TV, and now we've got
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   Internet, and all of those give access to more and more teaching that might or
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.200]   might not be different from what we're hearing. Now the question is, is that
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   a bad thing to have exposure to knowledge that might reveal unhelpful
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   things in your pastor? And my answer is, it may be a bad thing, or it may be a
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   good thing. I would say if it makes the pastor acknowledge that he has to make a
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.160]   good case so that people can see in the Bible what he's really saying is really
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.120]   there, and that his plans for the church are really biblical, then that's a good
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.320]   thing for him to feel that pressure. But if what's going on in the Internet
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   makes a person or a family disrespectful to their pastor, or cynical to their
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.120]   pastor, or disengaged from their church, then I think it's hurting them and not
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.200]   not helping them. But if it leads the pastor to be more vigilant and leads the
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.560]   people into a careful consideration of what's really biblical, then I would
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.920]   think that would be all for the good. It might create some relational tensions
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.760]   between what they're hearing in the Internet by some preacher and what
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.200]   they're hearing at the church, but I think avoiding those kind of tensions by
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.600]   hiding from truth is probably not going to honor God, the God of love and the God
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.520]   of truth. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
