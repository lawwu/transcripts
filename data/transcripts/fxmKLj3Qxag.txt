[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   The doctrine of God's providence is the theme of Pastor John's new book by that title,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760]   Providence.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.720]   The glorious truth that God governs over everything in this universe has always been true, but
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.480]   for us to see and savor God's providence, we must learn this glorious truth for ourselves
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.240]   from what God has revealed to us in his word.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.640]   And when we see it and embrace it as true and glorious, this doctrine makes a very definite
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.400]   impact in our lives.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.840]   So on Wednesdays on the podcast, Pastor John is celebrating those real-life impacts that
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.080]   this doctrine makes on our lives.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.480]   There's a total of 10 implications he wants to address.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.000]   Last time in episode 1580, we looked at how God's design for all things in providence
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.320]   brings meaning to all of life.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.700]   In God's design of all things, no part of life is made meaningless.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.320]   That was implication number three.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.120]   Here now with implication number four is Pastor John.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.840]   The fourth effect, real-life effect of seeing and savoring, grasping and cherishing the
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.160]   reality of God's all-pervading, all-embracing providence is that it goes a long way to protecting
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:29.960]   us from the trivializing effects of contemporary culture and from the widespread habit of trifling
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.320]   with great things, even divine things.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.720]   Tony, I don't know how many people who are listening right now will resonate like I do
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.920]   with this precious effect of feeling the weight and the wonder of the providence of God.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.780]   One of the reasons this is so significant for me is that I have felt over the years
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.120]   that the greatest threat to my soul is not committing adultery against my wife or embezzling
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.640]   money from some ministry or even a sudden throwing away of my faith and becoming an
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   advocate for atheism or being overtaken by some terrible fit of rage and killing somebody.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:35.240]   None of those things has seemed to me to be nearly as threatening to my soul as the creeping
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   effect of pettiness.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:51.240]   The loss of all capacity to feel greatness and beauty and magnificence and depth and
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.400]   wonder and awe and reverence and weightiness.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.320]   My fear has not been that I will make shipwreck of my life through some dramatic, egregious
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:14.280]   sin, but through the steady drip from the faucet of silliness.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.960]   And lest I be misunderstood, this is not some appeal for high-level intellectual, educated
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.600]   perceptions of philosophical complexity, blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.720]   No, I'm talking about capacities that the simplest, most uneducated person in the world
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.920]   can feel if they are in touch with the greatest realities in the universe, which come not
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.520]   primarily through education, but through the awakening of heart capacities to soar with
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.760]   beauties and the mysteries of creation and redemption and with the revelation of God's
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.320]   nature and God's ways in Scripture.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   This capacity of heart is not given primarily through education.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.240]   It's given through the miracle of the Holy Spirit opening the eyes of the heart to be
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.640]   stunned by what is stunning and shocked by what is shocking and stand in awe of what
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.080]   is awesome and be amazed at what is amazing and feel the crushing weight of what is crushing
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   and see the glory of what is glorious and have affections that are somehow, in some
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.320]   measure, proportionate to the nature of the reality that God reveals to us in the world
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.840]   and in his Word.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.680]   I'm not on a quest for some kind of philosophical height.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.120]   I don't dread being unphilosophical.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:06.320]   I dread from my heart being shrunk down in heart to the level where my heart's capacities
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   for happiness consist only in silly TV jingles and empty-headed slapstick.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   That's what I fear.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:26.080]   And in my life, and this is why I'm commending it, in my life it is seeing and savoring the
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:35.480]   all-pervasive providence of God that has protected me from the shrinking of my soul.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:43.400]   One of the curses of our culture, and it has permeated the church and most Christian communication,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   is banality, triviality, silliness, superficiality, and an eerie addiction to flippancy and levity.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:07.640]   And this is accompanied by what to me seems a baffling allergy to seriousness, dignity,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:17.160]   articulate precision, brokenhearted joy in public speech, carelessness in speech, and
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.760]   casualness in demeanor turn up in places and times where you would least expect them, where
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.000]   you hope for clarity and earnestness and gravity.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.120]   My impression is that at the root of this culture of inarticulate, casual trifling is
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:48.240]   a loss of a sense of the weight of the greatness and awfulness—isn't that an interesting
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.000]   word?—awful, and a-w-e dash full, awfulness of God.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.420]   The loss of a sense of the awfulness of God.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.080]   Everything is light and funny because God is lightweight.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.520]   The boats of our communication bounce around with a chipper bearing on the waves of cultural
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:21.360]   trifling, because the heavy ballast of the great, sovereign, holy God of all-pervading
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:29.200]   providence has been offloaded at the docks, the docks of man-centered theology and endless
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.000]   screen time.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.520]   This is a tragedy, and not only because it is the fruit of trivializing God, but because
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:50.040]   it hinders us from seeing him and experiencing him as he really is in the majesty of his
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.600]   all-embracing providence.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:04.080]   My guess is that some who listen to me right now will have no categories for hearing what
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:16.200]   I'm saying except as hearing it as a summons to grim, dour, somberness, and boredom.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   That's what Piper's advocating right now.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:25.160]   That's what it sounds like, because we live in a culture that can scarcely imagine something
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:37.400]   like glad gravity, joyful sorrow, humor, and yes, I am defending humor.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:47.080]   Humor has been so identified with silliness and levity and slapstick of verbal antics
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:58.040]   that the robust, reality-rooted, natural explosiveness of humor is for many inconceivable.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.000]   Charles Spurgeon was a very funny man, great preacher from the last, I guess, two centuries
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.880]   ago in the 1800s.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.520]   But he was not a man of levity.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:19.640]   He did not trifle with sacred things or think that worship was a place for casual clowning.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.120]   He was not allergic to seriousness or dignity.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:31.780]   Three years after his death, Robertson Nicole expressed my concerns and used Spurgeon as
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.700]   a counter example.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:40.420]   He said this, "Evangelism of the humorous type may attract multitudes, but it lays the
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.960]   soul in ashes and destroys the very germs of religion."
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:52.520]   Mr. Spurgeon is often thought by those who do not know his sermons to have been a humorous
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.840]   preacher.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:03.120]   As a matter of fact, there was no preacher whose tone was more uniformly earnest, reverent,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.360]   and solemn.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:15.480]   Of course, every mature and healthy person knows that unbroken seriousness of a melodramatic
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:23.640]   or somber kind will inevitably communicate a sickness of soul.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.280]   But that's not our danger here in the first half of the 21st century.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:41.680]   Our danger is drowning in an ocean of banality and silliness, emptiness, the losing of our
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:51.800]   capacities for feeling anything like the depth and height of what we ought to feel in the
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.720]   presence of God.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.600]   That's our danger.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:04.880]   And my point here is that seeing and savoring the all-embracing, all-pervasive providence
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:14.040]   of God has a wonderful effect—certainly has in my life—a wonderful effect in helping
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.140]   us recover and preserve and grow in those capacities.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:29.920]   It protects us from the trivializing effects of contemporary culture and from the widespread
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.200]   habit of trifling with everything, even the great things of God.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.680]   I thank God for that season in my life when he wakened me and shocked me and frightened
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:52.760]   me and comforted me and rescued me from the shrinking and the deadening effects of losing
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.920]   the greatness and beauty and joy of God in a fog of trifles.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   Powerful.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.840]   That was implication number four of God's providence and how it will make a real impact
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.040]   on our lives in cutting through the fog of trivialities that surround us in our culture.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.760]   We're looking at 10 of these implications on Wednesdays.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.280]   Thank you for joining us for it.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.280]   Thanks for listening.

[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.440]   While we close out the podcast week with a technical question over whether our happiness
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.200]   is moral or non-moral—it's an important conversation—we'll explain the question
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.960]   and why it's important when we return on Friday.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.460]   Thanks for listening.
