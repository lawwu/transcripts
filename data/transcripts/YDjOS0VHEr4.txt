[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.780]   okay so uh touring environment let's start there some of the most impactful important humans who
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.060]   have ever lived in computing why were they wrong so i worked with uh andy gleason who is touring's

[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:51.520]   - Yeah. - Then von Neumann wrote deeply and beautifully about many things, but not computing. He wrote a horrible memo called the first draft of a report on the EDVAC, which is how you program a very early computer. In it, he essentially roughly took Turing's architecture and built it into a machine. So the legacy of that is
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   - Yeah.

[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:36.420]   And working at that boundary helped lead to things like my lab was part of doing with a number of interesting collaborators, the first faster than classical quantum computations.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.720]   We were part of a collaboration creating the minimal synthetic organism where you design life in a computer.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.380]   Those both involve domains where you just can't separate hardware from software.

And then I discovered in the basement of the music department at Cornell was David Borden, who you might not have heard of, but is legendary in electronic music, because he was really the first electronic musician. So Bob Moog, who invented Moog synthesizers, was a physics student at Cornell, like me crossing the street, and eventually he was kicked out and invented electronic music.

And so, the work in CBA today ranges from developing Zeptojoule electronics for the lowest power computing to micro machining diamonds to take million, 10 million RPM bearings for molecular spectroscopy studies up to exploring robots to build hundred meter structures in space. Okay, can we, the three things you just mentioned, let's start with the biggest. What are some of the biggest stuff you attempted to explore in CBA today?

[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:58.740]   let me go back to bring in now Shannon as well as Van Neumann.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.740]   Claude Shannon.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.740]   Yeah. So what is digital?
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   The casual obvious answer is digital in one and zero.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.740]   But that's wrong. There's a much deeper answer, which is
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.360]   Claude Shannon at MIT wrote the best master's thesis ever.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   In his master's thesis, he wrote the best master's thesis ever.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   In his master's thesis, he wrote the best master's thesis ever.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   In his master's thesis, he wrote the best master's thesis ever.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   Mm-hmm.

[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   In his master's thesis, he wrote the best master's thesis ever.

[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.200]   in his master's thesis ever. in his master's thesis, he wrote the modern notion of digital logic.

[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.340]   And Shannon worked on it as a student,
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:52.380]   And Shannon worked on it as a student,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.600]   And Shannon worked on it as a student, and he got so annoyed
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:53.660]   and he got so annoyed
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.860]   and he got so annoyed in his master's thesis,
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:54.920]   in his master's thesis,
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.560]   in his master's thesis, he invented digital logic.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:56.620]   he invented digital logic.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:56.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:56.940]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.500]   Mm-hmm. But he then went on to Bell Labs,
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:20:59.540]   But he then went on to Bell Labs,
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.000]   But he then went on to Bell Labs, and what he did there was
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.060]   and what he did there was
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.000]   and what he did there was communication was beginning to expand.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.060]   communication was beginning to expand.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.300]   communication was beginning to expand. There was more demand for phone lines.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:27.400]   There was more demand for phone lines.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.020]   There was more demand for phone lines. And so there's a question about
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.120]   And so there's a question about
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   And so there's a question about how many phone lines you could,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.200]   how many phone lines you could,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.180]   how many phone lines you could, phone messages you could send down
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:32.240]   phone messages you could send down
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.340]   phone messages you could send down a wire.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.400]   a wire.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.220]   a wire. And you could try to just make it
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:34.280]   And you could try to just make it
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.300]   And you could try to just make it better and better.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:35.360]   better and better.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.140]   better and better. He asked a question nobody had asked,
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.200]   He asked a question nobody had asked,
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.300]   He asked a question nobody had asked, which is,
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.100]   which is, rather than make it better and better,
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.160]   which is, rather than make it better and better, what's the limit to how good it can be.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.200]   And the further you get, the worse it sounds.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.300]   And the further you get, the worse it sounds.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.840]   And the further you get, the worse it sounds. But people watching this are getting it
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:42.900]   But people watching this are getting it
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.780]   But people watching this are getting it as packets of data in a network.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:47.840]   as packets of data in a network.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.380]   as packets of data in a network. When the computer that's watching this
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:50.440]   When the computer that's watching this
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.820]   When the computer that's watching this gets the packet of information,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:53.880]   gets the packet of information,
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.960]   gets the packet of information, it can detect and correct an error.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:56.980]   it can detect and correct an error.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.580]   it can detect and correct an error. And what Shannon showed is,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.420]   And what Shannon showed is, if the noise in the cable to the people watching this
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.500]   and what Shannon showed is if the noise in the cable to the people watching this is above a threshold,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:32.600]  -
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:32.700]   they're doomed.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.540]   they're doomed. But if the noise is below a threshold,
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:33.540]   But if the noise is below a threshold, for a linear increase in the energy representing our conversation,
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:33.540]   For a linear increase in the energy representing our conversation, the error rate goes down exponentially.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:33.540]   The error rate goes down exponentially. Exponentials are fast. There's very few of them in engineering.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:33.540]   The exponentials are fast. There's very few of them in engineering. And the exponential reduction of error below a threshold if you restore state is called a threshold theorem. That's what led to digital. That means unreliable things can work reliably. So Shannon did that for the first three years.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.580]   for communication. Then von Neumann was inspired by that and applied it to computation.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.580]   for communication. Then von Neumann was inspired by that and applied it to computation. And he showed how an unreliable computer can operate reliably by using the same threshold property of restoring state.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.580]   Then von Neumann was inspired by that and applied it to computation. And he showed how an unreliable computer can operate reliably by using the same threshold property of restoring state.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.580]   And he showed how an unreliable computer can operate reliably by using the same threshold property of restoring state.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.580]   It was then forgotten many years. We had to rediscover it in effect in the quantum computing era when things are very unreliable again.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.580]   It was then forgotten many years. We had to rediscover it in effect in the quantum computing era when things are very unreliable again.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:58.580]   But now to go back to how does this relate to the biggest things I've made.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:26.620]  ,
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.620]   So in fabrication, MIT invented computer-controlled manufacturing in 1952.

So, in the same sense, the research now, we spent a while talking about is how we get to the replicator. Today, you can do all of that. If you close your eyes and view the whole fab lab as a machine in that room, you can make almost any kind of machine.

Now, hobbyists have been making guns for ages and guns are available just about anywhere. So you could go into the lab and make a gun today. It's not a very good gun. And guns are easily available. And so generally what we run these lab and war zones. What we find is people don't go to them to make weapons, which you can already do anyway. It's an alternative to making weapons.

[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:14.340]   I mentioned Charlie Bennett and David DiVincenzo and Ralph Landauer and Nabeel Amir and these were all gods of thinking about physics and computing.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:44.360]   I yelled at the whole computer industry being based on a fiction metropolis,
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:44.360]   Programmers frolicking in the garden while somebody moves levers in the basement. There's a complete parallel history of Maxwell to Boltzmann to Zillard to Landauer to Bennett. Most people won't know most of these names, but this whole parallel history thinking deeply about how computation and physics relate to the computer.
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.720]   So I was collaborating with that whole group of people.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.360]   And then at MIT, I was in this high traffic environment.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.700]   I wasn't deeply inspired to think about better ways to detect shoplifting tags,
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.700]   but stumbled across companies that needed help with that and was thinking about it.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.200]   And then I realized those two worlds intersected
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.880]   and we could use the failed approach for the shoplifting tags
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.380]   to make early quantum computing algorithms.

[01:25:41.520 --> 01:26:02.320]   So, molecular biology is dominated by geometry. That's why the protein folding is so important, that the geometry gives the function. And there's this hierarchical construction of as you go through primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, the shapes of the molecules make the shape of the protein.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:02.900]   Okay.

If you look at how your muscles move, if you were to see a simulation of it, it would look like a improbable science fiction cyborg world of these little walking robots that walk on a discrete lattice. They're really exquisite machines. And then from there, there's this whole hierarchical stack of once you get to the top of that, you then start making organelles, and then you start making the

[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:21.020]   Imagine a container that has a wall, and it's got gas on both sides, and a little door.
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:31.020]   And if the door is a molecular-sized creature, and it could watch the molecules coming, and when a fast molecule is coming, it opens the door.
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:31.540]   When a slow molecule is coming, it opens the door.

[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:00.420]   When something is hot and is cold, you can make an engine.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:00.540]   And so you close that, you make an engine and you make energy.

[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:00.740]   So the demon is violating thermodynamics, because it's never touching the molecule.
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:00.740]   Yet, by just opening and closing the door, it can make arbitrary amounts of energy.

[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.420]   So that's Maxwell's demon.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.420]   That problem is connected to everything we just spoke about for the last few hours.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:14.420]   So Leo Szilard, around early 1900s, was a deep physicist who then had a lot to do with also postwar antinuclear power.

I once did a drive, in fact up to the Mussolini era villa outside Torino, in the early days of what became quantum computing, with a famous person who thinks about quantum mechanics and consciousness. And we had the most infuriating conversation that went roughly along the lines of "consciousness is weird, quantum mechanics is weird, and we're going to have to figure out what's going to happen next."

[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:32.760]   I have no idea what the meaning of life is, but maybe that's the meaning of life.

[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:38.760]   Because there's a magic to it all.
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.540]   Everything you've talked about, from starting from the basic elements,
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:42.860]   to the basic elements, to the basic elements,
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:42.860]   and then you have to go through the process of making the life meaningful and fulfilling.

[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:42.940]  recognize the importance of making life meaningful and fulfilling.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:42.940]   The selfish gene answer to the meaning of life is the meaning of life is the propagation of life.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:42.940]   It was a step for atoms to assemble into a molecule, for molecules to assemble into a protocell,
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:04:12.960]   and then it was a step for cells to form organs, the organs to form an organism.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:12.960]   Then it was a step for organisms to form family units, then family units to form villages.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:12.960]   You can view each of those as a stack in the level of organization.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:12.960]   So you could view everything we've spoken about as the imperative of life,
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:12.960]   just the next step in the hierarchy of that and the fulfillment of the inexorable drive of the vitality
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:42.980]   and the evolution of life as a whole.
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:42.980]   The two of us having an old chat yes yeah and so continues and even then the singularity is just a transition up the ladder there's nothing deeper to consciousness than it's a derived property of distributed problem-solving there's nothing deeper to consciousness than it's a derived property of distributed problem-solving
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:42.980]   there's nothing deeper to consciousness than it's a derived property of distributed problem-solving
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   embodied AI in morphogenesis so why so much of this conversation in my life is involved in these fab labs and initially it just started as outreach then it started as keeping up with it then it turned to it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   it was rewarding then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs in
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:43.020]   the more knowledge is coming back from the the more knowledge is coming back from the labs and it's going into them and then finally it ends with you know what I described as competing with myself at MIT but a better way to say that is tapping the brain power of the planet and so from I guess for me personally that's the meaning of my life and maybe that's the meaning for the universe too it's using us humans and
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:43.120]   using us humans and
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:48.080]   using us humans and our creations to understand itself in the way it's a
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:48.100]   our creations to understand itself in the way it's a
[02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:51.720]   our creations to understand itself in the way it's a whatever the creative process that created earth is
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:51.740]   whatever the creative process that created earth is
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:55.280]   whatever the creative process that created earth is competing with itself yeah so you could take
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:55.280]   competing with itself yeah so you could take
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:57.360]   competing with itself yeah so you could take morphogenesis as a summary of this whole
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:57.380]   morphogenesis as a summary of this whole
[02:05:57.380 --> 02:05:59.520]   morphogenesis as a summary of this whole conversation or you could take recursion
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:05:59.540]   conversation or you could take recursion
[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:02.820]   conversation or you could take recursion that that in a sense what we've been
[02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:02.840]   that that in a sense what we've been
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:05.640]   that in a sense what we've been talking about is recursion all the way down and
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:05.660]   talking about is recursion all the way down and
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:31.300]   the talking about is recursion all the way down and then you know you're going to be able to do a
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:31.320]   then you know you're going to be able to do a
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.940]   then you know you're going to be able to do a different thing so in the end I think this
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:33.960]   different thing so in the end I think this
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:35.680]   different thing so in the end I think this whole thing is pretty fun it's short life is but
[02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:35.740]   whole thing is pretty fun it's short life is but
