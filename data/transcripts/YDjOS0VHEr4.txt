[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   The ribosome, who I mentioned a little while back, can make an elephant one molecule at a time.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.060]   Ribosomes are slow.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.000]   They run at about one molecule a second, but ribosomes make ribosomes.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.020]   So you have trillions of them, and that makes an elephant.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:22.920]   In the same way, these little assembly robots I'm describing can make giant structures at heart because the robot can make the robot.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:33.000]   So more recently, two of my students, Amira and Miana, had a nature communication paper showing how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800]   So the robots can make the robots, so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.160]   The following is a conversation with Neil Gershenfeld, the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms,
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.040]   an amazing laboratory that is breaking down boundaries between the digital and physical worlds,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.240]   fabricating,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.980]   objects,
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.440]   and machines at all scales of reality,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:05.700]   including robots and automata that can build copies of themselves and self-assemble into complex structures.
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.440]   His work inspires millions across the world as part of the maker movement to build cool stuff,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.000]   to create the very act that makes life so beautiful and fun.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.400]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.380]   To support it,

[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.220]   And now, dear friends, here's Neil Gershenfeld.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.220]   You have spent your life working at the boundary between bits and atoms,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.220]   so the digital and the physical.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.220]   What have you learned about engineering and about nature reality from working at this divide,
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.720]   trying to bridge this divide?
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.020]   I learned why von Neumann and Turing made fundamental mistakes.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.020]   That's good stuff.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.340]   I learned why von Neumann and Turing made fundamental mistakes.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.340]   That's good stuff.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.600]   I learned why von Neumann and Turing made fundamental mistakes.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   That's good stuff.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   I learned the secret of life.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   I learned the secret of life.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   I learned how to solve many of the world's most important problems,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   which all sound presumptuous, but all of those are things I learned at that boundary.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Okay, so Turing and von Neumann, let's start there.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Some of the most impactful, important humans who have ever lived in computing.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Why were they wrong?
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   So I worked with Andy Gleason, who is Turing's counterpart.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   So just for background, if anybody doesn't know, Turing is credited with the modern architecture of computing.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Among many other things, Andy Gleason was his US counterpart.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   And you might not have heard of Andy Gleason, but you might have heard of the Hilbert problems.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   And Andy Gleason solved the fifth one.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   So he was a really notable mathematician.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   During the war, he was Turing's counterpart.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   Then von Neumann is credited with the modern architecture of computing.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   And one of his students was Marvin Minsky.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   So I could ask Marvin what Johnny was thinking.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   And I could ask Andy what Alan was thinking.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   And what came out from that, what I came to appreciate as background,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   I never understood the difference between computer science and physical science.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   But Turing's machine, that's the foundation of modern computing, has a simple physics mistake,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   which is the head is distinct from the tape.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   So in the Turing machine, there's a head that programmatically moves and reads and writes the tape.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   The head is distinct from the tape, which means, per se,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   persistence of information is separate from interaction with information.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   Then von Neumann wrote deeply and beautifully about many things, but not computing.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   He wrote a horrible memo called the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   which is how you program a very early computer.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   In it, he essentially, roughly took Turing's architecture and built it into a machine.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   So the legacy of that is the computer somebody's using to watch this is spending much of its effort
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   moving information from storage transistors to processing transistors,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   even though they have the same computational complexity.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   So in computer science, when you learn about computing,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   there's a ridiculous taxonomy of about 100 different models of computation.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   But they're all fictions.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   In physics,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   a patch of space occupies space.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   It stores state.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   It takes time to transit.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   And you can interact.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   That is the only model of computation that's physical.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   Everything else is a fiction.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   So I really came to appreciate that a few years back when I did a keynote for the annual meeting of the supercomputer industry
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   and then went into the halls and spent time with the supercomputer builders
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   and came to appreciate...
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   Oh, let's see.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   If you're familiar with the movie The Metropolis,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   people would frolic upstairs in the gardens and down in the basement, people would move levers.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   And that's how computing exists today, that we pretend software is not physical.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   It's separate from hardware.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   And the whole canon of computer science is based on this fiction that bits aren't constrained by atoms.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   But all sorts of scaling issues in computing come from that boundary,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   but all sorts of opportunities come from that boundary.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   And so you can trace it all the way back to Turing's machine making this mistake between the head and the tape.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   Von Neumann, he never called it Von Neumann's architecture.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   He wrote about it in this dreadful memo.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   And then he wrote beautifully about other things we'll talk about.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Now, to end a long answer, Turing and Von Neumann both knew this.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   So all of the canon of computer scientists credits them for what was never meant to be a computer architecture.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   Both Turing and Von Neumann ended their life studying exactly how software becomes hardware.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   So Von Neumann studied self-reproducing automata, how a machine communicates its own construction.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   Turing studied morphogenesis, how genes give rise to form.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   They ended their life studying the embodiment of computation,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   something that's been forgotten by the canon of computing,
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   but developed sort of off to the sides by a really interesting lineage.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   So there's no distinction.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   There's no distinction between the head and the tape,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   between the computer and the computation.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   It is all computation.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   Right.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   So I never understood the difference between computer science and physical science.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   And working at that boundary helped lead to things like my lab was part of doing,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   with a number of interesting collaborators, the first faster than classical quantum computations.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   We were part of a collaboration creating the minimal synthetic organism where you design life in a computer.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   Those both involve domains where you just can't separate hardware from software.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   The embodiment of computation is embodied in these really profound ways.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   So the first quantum computations, synthetic life, so in the space of biology,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   the space of physics at the lowest level, and the space of biology at the lowest level.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   So let's talk about CBA, center of bits and atoms.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   What's the origin story of this MIT,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   this legendary MIT center that you're a part of creating?
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   In high school, I really wanted to go to vocational school
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   where you learn to weld and fix cars and build houses.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   And I was told, "No, you're smart.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   You have to sit in a room."
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   And nobody could explain to me why I couldn't go to vocational school.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   I then worked at Bell Labs, this wonderful place before deregulation, legendary place.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   And I would get union grievances because I would go into the workshop and try to make something.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   And they would say, "No, you're smart.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   You have to tell somebody what to do."
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   And it wasn't until MIT, and I'll explain how CBA started,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   but I could create CBA, that I came to understand this is a mistake that dates back to the Renaissance.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   So in the Renaissance, the liberal arts emerged.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   And liberal doesn't mean politically liberal.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   This was the path to liberation, birth of humanism.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   And so the liberal arts were the trivium, quadrivium, roughly language, natural science.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   And at that moment, what emerged was this dreadful concept of the illiberal arts.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   So anything that wasn't the liberal arts was for commercial gain
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   and was just making stuff and wasn't valid for serious study.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   And so that's why we're left with learning to weld wasn't a subject for serious study.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   But the means of expression have changed.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   It's the Renaissance.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   So micro-machining or embedded coding is every bit as expressive as painting a painting or writing a sonnet.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   So never understanding this difference between computer science and physical science,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   the path that led me to create CBA with colleagues was I was what's called a junior fellow at Harvard.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   I was visiting MIT through Marvin because I was interested in the physics of musical instruments.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   This will be another slight digression.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   In Cornell, I would study physics and then I would cross the street and go to the music department
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   where I played the bassoon and I would trim reeds and play the reeds.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   And they'd be beautiful, but then they'd get soggy.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   And then I discovered in the basement of the music department at Cornell was David Borden,
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   who you might not have heard of, but is legendary in electronic music
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   because he was really the first electronic musician.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   So Bob Moog, who invented Moog synthesizers,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   was a physics student at Cornell like me crossing the street.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   And eventually he was kicked out and invented electronic music.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   David Borden was the first musician who created electronic music.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   So he's legendary for people like Phil Glass and Steve Reich.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   And so that got me thinking about I would behave as a scientist in the music department,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   in the physics department, but not in the music department.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   Got me thinking about what's the computational capacity of a musical instrument.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   And through Marvin,
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   he introduced me to Todd Backover at the Media Lab,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   who is just about to start a project with Yo-Yo Ma
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   that led to a collaboration to instrument a cello
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   to extract Yo-Yo's data and bring it out into computational environments.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   What is the computational capacity of a musical instrument?
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   As we continue on this tangent and when we shall return to CBA.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   So one part of that is to understand the computing.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   And if you look at like,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   the finest time scale and length scale you need to model the physics,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   it's not heroic.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   A good GPU can do teraflops today.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   That used to be a national class supercomputer.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   Now it's just a GPU.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   And that's about,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   if you take the time scales and length scales relevant for the physics,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   that's about the scale of the physics computing.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   For Yo-Yo,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   what was really driving it was he's completely unsentimental about the strad.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   It's not that it makes some magical wiggles in the sound wave.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   It's performance as a controller.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   How he can manipulate it as an interface device.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   Interface between what and what exactly?
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   Him and sound.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   Okay.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   And so what it led to was,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   I had started by thinking about ops per second,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   but Yo-Yo's question was really resolution and bandwidth.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   It's how fast can you measure what he does?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   And the bandwidth and the resolution,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   of detecting his controls and then mapping them into sounds.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   And what we found,
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   what he found was if you instrument everything he does and connect it to almost anything,
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   it sounds like Yo-Yo.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   That the magic is in the control,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   not in ineffable details in how the wood wiggles.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   And so with Yo-Yo and Todd,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   that led to a piece.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   And towards the end,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   I asked Yo-Yo what it would take for him
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   to get rid of his Strad and use our stuff.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   And his answer was just logistics.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   It was at that time,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   our stuff was like a rack of electronics and lots of cables
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   and some grad students to make it work.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   Once the technology becomes as invisible as the Strad,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   then sure, absolutely,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   he would take it.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   And by the way,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   as a footnote on the footnote,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   an accident in the sensing of Yo-Yo's cello
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   led to a hundred million dollar a year auto safety business
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   to control airbags and cars.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   How did that work?
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   I had to instrument the bow without interfering with it.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   So I set up local electromagnetic fields
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   where I would detect how those fields interact
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   with the bow he's playing.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   But we had a problem that his hand,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   whenever his hand got near these sensing fields,
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   I would start sensing his hand rather than the materials on the bow.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   And I didn't quite understand what was going on with those,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   that interference.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   So my very first grad student ever,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   Josh Smith,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   did a thesis on tomography with electric fields,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   how to see in 3D with electric fields.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Then through Todd and at that point,
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   research scientist in my lab,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   Joe Paradiso,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   it led to a collaboration with Penn and Teller
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   where we did a magic trick in Las Vegas to contact Houdini.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   And sort of these fields are sort of like,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   you know,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   contacting spirits.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   So we did a magic trick in Las Vegas.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   And then the crazy thing that happened after that was
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   Phil Rittmuller came running into my lab.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   He worked with,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   this became with Honda and NEC,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   airbags were killing infants in rear facing child seats.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   Cars need to distinguish a front facing adult
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   where you'd save the life versus a bag of groceries
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   where you don't need to fire the airbag versus a rear facing infant
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   where you would kill it.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   So the seat need to in effect see in 3D
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   to understand the occupants.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   And so we took the Penn and Teller magic trick
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   derived from Josh's thesis from Yo-Yo's Cello
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   to an auto show.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   And all the car companies said,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   great,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.600]   when can we buy it?
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   And so that became Elicis.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.600]   And it was a hundred million dollar a year business
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   making sensors.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   There wasn't a lot of publicity because it was in the car.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   So the car didn't kill you.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   So they didn't sort of advertise.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   We have nice sensors.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   So the car doesn't kill you.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   But it became a leading auto safety sensor.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   - And that started from the cello
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   and the question of the computational capacity
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   of a musical instrument.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   - Right.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   So now to get back to MIT,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   I was spending a lot of outside time at IBM research
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   that had gods of the foundations of computing.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   There's just amazing people there.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   And I'd always expected to go to IBM to take over a lab.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   But at the last minute pivoted
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   and came to MIT to take a position in the Media Lab
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   and start what became the predecessor to CBA.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   Media Lab is well known for Nicholas Negroponte.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   What's less well known is the role of Jerry Wiesner.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   So Jerry was MIT's president
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   before that Kennedy science advisor,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   grand old man of science.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   At the end of his life,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   he was frustrated by how knowledge
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   was segregated.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   And so he wanted to create a department
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   of none of the above,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   a department for work that didn't fit in departments.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   And the Media Lab in a sense was a cover story
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   for him to hide a department.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   As MIT's president towards the end of his tenure,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   if he said, "I'm gonna make a department
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   for things that don't fit in departments,"
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   the departments would have screamed.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   But everybody was sort of paying attention
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   to Nicholas creating the Media Lab
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   and Jerry kind of hid in it a department.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Called Media Arts and Sciences.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   It's really the department of none of the above.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   And Jerry explaining that and Nicholas then confirming it
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   is really why I pivoted and went to MIT.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   Because my students who helped create quantum computing
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   or synthetic life get degrees from Media Arts and Sciences,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   this department of none of the above.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   So that led to coming to MIT.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   - Yeah.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   - With Todd and Joe Paradiso and Mike Hawley.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   We started a consortium called Things That Think.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.600]   And this was around the birth of Internet of Things and RFID.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   But then we started doing things like work we can discuss
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   that became the beginnings of quantum computing
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   and cryptography and materials and logic and microfluidics.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   And those needed much more significant infrastructure
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   and were much longer research arcs.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   So with a bigger team of about 20 people,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   we wrote a proposal to the NSF to assemble one of every tool
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   to make anything of any size was roughly the proposal.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   - One of any tool to make anything of any size.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   - Yeah.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   So they're usually nanometers, micrometers, millimeters,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   meters are segregated, input and output is segregated.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   We wanted to look just very literally at how digital becomes physical
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   and physical becomes digital.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   And fortunately we got NSF
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   on a good day and they funded this facility
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   of one of almost every tool to make anything.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   And so with a group of core colleagues
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   that included Joe Jacobson, Ike Triang, Scott Manalis,
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   we launched CBA.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   - And so you're talking about nanoscale, microscale, nanostructures,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   microstructures, macrostructures, electron microscopes
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   and focus time beam probes for nanostructures,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   laser, micro machining and X-ray,
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   micro tomography for microstructures,
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   multi-axis machining and 3D printing for macrostructures,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   just some examples.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   What are we talking about in terms of scale?
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   How can we build tiny things and big things all in one place?
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   - Yeah, so a well-equipped research lab
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   has the sort of tools we're talking about,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   but they're segregated in different places.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   They're typically also run by technicians
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   where you then have an account
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.600]   and a project and you charge.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   All of these tools are essentially
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   when you don't know what you're doing,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   not when you do know what you're doing,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   in that they're when you need to work across length scales
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   where we don't, once projects are running in this facility,
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   we don't charge for time,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   you don't make a formal proposal to schedule
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   and the users really run the tools
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   and it's for work that's kind of inchoate
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.600]   that needs to span these disciplines and length scales.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   And so work in the project today,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   work in CBA today ranges from developing
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   Zeptojoule electronics for the lowest power computing
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   to micro machining diamond to take million,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   10 million RPM bearings for molecular spectroscopy studies
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   up to exploring robots to build 100 meter structures in space.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   - Okay, can we, the three things you just mentioned,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   let's start with the biggest.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   What are some of the biggest stuff you attempted
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   to explore how to build in a lab?
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   - Sure, so viewed from one direction,
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   what we're talking about is a crazy random seeming
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   of almost unrelated projects.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   But if you rotate 90 degrees,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   it's really just a core thought over and over again,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   just very literally how bits and atoms relate,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   how digital and it just going from digital to physical
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   in many different domains,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   but it's really just the same idea over and over again.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   So to understand the biggest things,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   let me go back to bring in now Shannon,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   as well as Van Neumann.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   - Claude Shannon.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   - Yeah, so what is digital?
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   The casual obvious answer is digital in one and zero,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.600]   but that's wrong.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600]   There's a much deeper answer,
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   which is Claude Shannon,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.600]   at MIT wrote the best master's thesis ever.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   In his master's thesis,
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   he invented our modern notion of digital logic.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   Where it came from was Vannevar Bush was a grand old man at MIT.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   He created the post-war research establishment
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   that led to the National Science Foundation.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   And he made an important mistake,
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   which we can talk about,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   but he also made the differential analyzer,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   which was the last great analog computer
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   so it was a room full of gears and pulleys.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   And the longer it ran,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   the worse the answer was.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   And Shannon worked on it as a student
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.600]   and he got so annoyed in his master's thesis,
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   he invented digital logic.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   But he then went on to Bell Labs
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   and what he did there was communication
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   was beginning to expand.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   There was more demand for phone lines.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.600]   And so there's a question about how many phone lines
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   you could phone messages,
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   you could send down a wire.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   And you could try to just make it better and better.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   He asked a question nobody had asked,
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   which is rather than make it better and better,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   what's the limit to how good it can be?
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   And he proved a couple things,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   but one of the main things he proved
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   was a threshold theorem for channel capacity.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   And so what he showed was my voice to you right now
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   is coming as a wave through sound.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   And the further you get, the worse it sounds.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   But people watching this are getting it
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   as packets of data in a network.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   When the computer they're watching this
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   gets the packet of information,
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   it can detect and correct an error.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   And what Shannon showed is if the noise
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   in the cable to the people watching this
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   is above a threshold, they're doomed.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   But if the noise is below a threshold,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   for a linear increase in the energy representation
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   of our conversation,
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   the error rate goes down exponentially.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   Exponentials are fast.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   There's very few of them in engineering.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   And the exponential reduction of error
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   below a threshold if you restore state
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   is called a threshold theorem.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   That's what led to digital.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   That means unreliable things can work reliably.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   So Shannon did that for communication.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   Then von Neumann was inspired by that
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   and applied it to communication.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   And applied it to computation.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   And he showed how an unreliable computer
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   can operate reliably
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   by using the same threshold property
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   of restoring state.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   It was then forgotten many years.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   We had to rediscover it in effect
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600]   in the quantum computing era
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   when things are very unreliable again.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   But now to go back to
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   how does this relate to the biggest things I've made?
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.600]   So in fabrication, MIT invented
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.600]   computer-controlled manufacturing
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   in 1952.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   Jet aircraft were just emerging.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   There was a limit to turning cranks
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   on a milling machine to make parts
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   for jet aircraft.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   Now this is a messy story.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   MIT actually stole computer-controlled machining
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   from an inventor who brought it to MIT.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   Wanted to do a joint project with the Air Force
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   and MIT effectively stole it from him.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   So it's kind of a messy history.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   But that sounds like the birth
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   of computer-controlled machining.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   1952.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   There are a number of inventors of 3D printing.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   One of the companies spun off from my lab
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   by Max Lobovsky is Formlabs,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   which is now a billion-dollar 3D printing company.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   That's the modern version.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   But all of that's analog,
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   meaning the information is in the control computer.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   There's no information in the materials.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   And so it goes back to Vannevar Bush's analog computer.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   If you make a mistake in printing or machining,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   just the mistake accumulates.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   The real birth of computerized digital manufacturing
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   is four billion years ago.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.600]   That's the evolutionary age of the ribosome.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   So the way you're manufactured is there's a code
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   that describes you, the genetic code.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   It goes to a micro machine, the ribosome,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.600]   which is this molecular factory that builds the molecules
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   that are you.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.600]   The key thing to know about that is
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   there are about 20 amino acids that get assembled.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   And in that machinery,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   it does everything Shannon and von Neumann taught us.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   You detect and correct errors.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   So if you mix chemicals,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   the error rate is about a part in 100.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.600]   When you elongate a protein in the ribosome,
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.600]   it's about a part in 10 to the 4.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   When you replicate DNA,
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   there's an extra level of error correction.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   It's a part in 10 to the 8.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   And so in the molecules that make you,
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   you can detect and correct errors,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   and you don't need a ruler to make you.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   The geometry comes from your parts.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.600]   So now compare a child playing with Lego
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.600]   and a state-of-the-art 3D printer
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   or computerized milling machine.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   The tower made by a child is more accurate
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   than their motor control
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   because the act of snapping the bricks together
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   gives you a constraint on the joints.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   You can join bricks made out of dissimilar materials.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   You don't need a ruler for Lego
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   because the geometry locally gives you the global parts.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   And there's no Lego trash.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   The parts have enough information to disassemble them.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   Those are exactly the properties of a digital code.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   The unreliable is made reliable.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.600]   So what the ribosome figured out 4 billion years ago
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   is how to embody these digital properties
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   in the digital world.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   And that's how we can build these digital properties,
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   but not for communication or computation in effect,
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   but for construction.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   So a number of projects in my lab
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   have been studying the idea of digital materials.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   And think of a digital material just as Lego bricks.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   The precise meaning is a discrete set of parts
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   reversibly joined with global geometry
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600]   determined from local constraints.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.600]   And so it's digitizing the materials.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.600]   And so I'm coming back to what are the biggest things I've made.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   My lab was working with the aerospace industry.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   So Spirit Aero was Boeing's factories.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.600]   They asked us for how to join composites.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   When you make a composite airplane,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   you make these giant wing and fuselage parts.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   And they asked us for a better way to stick them together
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   because the joints were a place of failure.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   And what we discovered was
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   instead of making a few big parts,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   if you make little loops of carbon fiber
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   and you reversibly link them in joints,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   and you do it in a special geometry
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   that balances being under-constrained and over-constrained
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.600]   with just the right degrees of freedom,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   we set the world record
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   for the highest modulus ultralight material
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   just by in effect making carbon fiber Lego.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   So lightweight materials are crucial for energy efficiency.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   This let us make the lightest weight high modulus material.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   We then showed that with just a few part types,
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   we can tune the material properties.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   And then you can create really wild robots
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   that instead of having a tool the size of a jumbo jet
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   to make a jumbo jet,
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   you can make little robots
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   that walk on these cellular structures
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   to build the structures
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   where they error correct their position on the structure
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   and they navigate on the structure.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   And so using all of that,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.600]   with NASA,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   we made morphing airplanes.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   A former student, Kenny Chung and Ben Jeanette
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   made a morphing airplane
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   the size of NASA Langley's biggest wind tunnel.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   With Toyota, we've made super efficiency race cars.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   We're right now looking at projects with NASA
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   to build these for things like space telescopes
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   and space habitats
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   where the ribosome,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   who I mentioned a little while back,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   can make an elephant one molecule at a time.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   Ribosomes are slow.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   They run at about one molecule a second,
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   but ribosomes make ribosomes.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   So you have thousands of them,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   trillions of them,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.600]   and that makes an elephant.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   In the same way,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   these little assembly robots I'm describing
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   can make giant structures at heart
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   because the robot can make the robot.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   So more recently,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   two of my students,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   Samira and Miana,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   had a nature communication paper showing
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   how this robot can be made out of the parts
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.600]   it's making so the robots can make the robot
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   - It can self-replicate.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   Can you linger on what that robot looks like?
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   What is a robot that can walk along
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   and do error correction?
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   And what is a robot that can self-replicate
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.600]   from the materials that is given?
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   What does that look like?
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   What are we talking about?
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   This is fascinating.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   - Yeah.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   The answer is different at different length scales.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   So to explain that,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   in biology,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   primary structure,
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   primary structure is the code in the messenger RNA
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   that says what the ribosome should build.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   Secondary structure are geometrical motifs.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   They're things like helices or sheets.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   Tertiary structures are functional elements
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   like electron donors or acceptors.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Quaternary structure is things like molecular motors
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   that are moving my mouth
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   or making the synapses work in my brain.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   So there's that hierarchy of primary,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   secondary, tertiary, quaternary.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   Now what's interesting is
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   if you want to buy electronics today from a vendor,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   there are hundreds of thousands of types of resistors
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   or capacitors or transistors,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   huge inventory.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   All of biology is just made from this inventory
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   of 20 parts of amino acids.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   And by composing them,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   you can create all of life.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   And so as part of this digitization of materials,
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   we're in effect trying to create something like amino acids
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   for engineering,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   creating all of technology from 20 parts.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   As another discretion,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   I helped start an office for science in Hollywood.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   And there was a fun thing for the movie "The Martian"
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   where I did a program with Bill Nye and a few others
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   on how to actually build a civilization on Mars
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   that they described in a way that I like
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   as I was talking about how to go to Mars without luggage.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   And at heart,
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   it's sort of how to create life in nonliving machines.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   So if you think about this primary, secondary, tertiary,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   quaternary structure,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   in my lab,
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   we're doing that,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   but on different length scales for different purposes.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   So we're making micro robots out of like nano bricks.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   And to make the robots to build large scale structures in space,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   the elements of the robots now are centimeters
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   rather than micrometers.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   And so the assembly robots for the bigger structures
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   are essentially nanomaterials.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   So the bigger structures are...
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.600]   There are the cells that make up the structure,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   but then we have functional cells.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   And so cells that can process and actuate.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   Each cell can like move one degree of freedom
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   or attach or detach or process.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   Now, those elements I just described,
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   we can make out of the still smaller parts.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   So eventually there's a hierarchy of the little parts
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   make little robots that make bigger parts of bigger robots
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   that can move up through that hierarchy.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   - And that way you can move up the length scale.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   - Right.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   Early on, I tried to go in a straight line
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   from the bottom to the top,
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   and that ended up being a bad idea.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   Instead, we're kind of doing all of these in parallel,
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   and then they're growing together.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   And so to make the larger scale structures,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   like there's a lot of hype right now
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   about 3D printing houses
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   where you have a printer the size of the house.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   We're right now working on using swarms of these,
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   you know, table scale robots
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   that walk on the structures
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   to place the parts much more efficiently.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   - That's amazing.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   But you're saying you can't for now
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   go from the very small to the very large.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   - That'll come.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   That'll come in stages.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   - Can I just linger on this idea?
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Starting from von Neumann's self-replicating automata
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   that you mentioned,
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   it's just a beautiful idea.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   - So that's at the heart of all of this.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600]   In the stack I described,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   so one student, Will Langford,
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   made these micro robots out of little parts
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   that then we're using
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   for Mianna's bigger robots up through this hierarchy.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   And it's really realizing this idea
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   of the self-reproducing automata.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   So von Neumann,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   when I complained about the von Neumann architecture,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   it's not fair to von Neumann
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   'cause he never claimed it as his architecture.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   He really wrote about it
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   in this one fairly dreadful memo
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   that led to all sorts of lawsuits and fights
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.600]   about the early days of computing.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   He did beautiful work on reliable computation
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   and unreliable devices.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   And towards the end of his life,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.600]   what he studied was how,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   and I have to say this precisely,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   how a computation communicates its own construction.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   - Yeah, so beautiful.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   - So a computation can store a description
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   of how to build itself.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   But now there's a really hard problem,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.600]   which is if you have that in your mind,
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   how do you transfer it and wake up a thing
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   that then can contain it?
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   So how do you give birth to a thing
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   that knows how to make itself?
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   And so with Stan Ulam,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   he invented cellular automata
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   as a way to simulate these,
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   but that was theoretical.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   Now the work I'm describing in my lab
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   is fundamentally how to realize it,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   how to realize self-reproducing automata.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   And so this is something von Neumann thought very deeply
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   and very beautifully about theoretically.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   And it's right at this intersection.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   It's not communication or computation or fabrication.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   It's right at this intersection
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   where communication and computation meets fabrication.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   Now the reason self-reproducing automata
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   intellectually is so important,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   'cause this is the foundation of life.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   This is really just understanding the essence of life.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   And in effect,
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   we're trying to create life in non-living material.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   The reason it's so important technologically
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   is because that's how you scale capacity.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   That's how you can make an elephant from a ribosome
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   'cause the assemblers make assemblers.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   - So simple building blocks
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   that inside themselves contain the information
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   of how to build more building blocks
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   and between each other construct arbitrarily complex objects.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   - Right, now let me give you the numbers.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   So let me relate this to,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   right now we're living in AI mania explosion,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   let me relate that to what we're talking about.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   A hundred petaflop computer,
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.600]   which is a current generation supercomputer,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   not quite the biggest ones,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   does 10 to the 17 ops per second.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   Your brain does 10 to the 17 ops per second.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   It has about 10 to the 15 synapses
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   and they run at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   So as of a year or two ago,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.600]   the computer that we're talking about
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   is a computer that's running at about 100 Hertz.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   So it's a computer that's running
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   So it's a computer that's running at about a hundred Hertz.

[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.600]   - Yes.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.600]   - In a very clear sense,
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   they are making self-reproducing machines.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   So one of the really cool things that's happened is
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   there's a whole network of machine builders around the world.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   So there's Danielle and now in Germany and Jens in Norway.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   And each of these people has learned the skills to go into a fab lab and make a machine.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   And so we've started creating a network of super fab.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   So the fab lab can make a machine,
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   but it can't make a number of the precision parts of the machine.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   So in places like Bhutan or Kerala in the south of India,
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   we've started creating super fab labs that have more advanced tools
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   to make the parts of the machines so that the machines themselves become even cheaper.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   So that is self-reproducing machines,
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   but you need to feed it things like bearings or microcontrollers.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   They can't make those parts.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.600]   But other than that, they're making their own things.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   And I should note as a footnote,
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   the stack I described of computers controlling machines to machine making machines,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   to assemblers to self-assemblers,
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   view that as fab 1, 2, 3, 4.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   So we're transitioning from fab 1 to fab 2.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   And the research in the lab is 3 and 4.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   At this fab 2 stage,
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   a big component of this is sustainability in the material feedstocks.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   So Alicia, a colleague in Chile,
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   is leading a great effort looking at how you take forest products and coffee grounds and seashells
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.600]   and arrange of locally available materials
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   and produce the high-tech materials that go into the lab.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   So all of that is machine building today.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   Then back in the lab,
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   what we can do today is
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   we have robots that can build structures and can assemble more robots that build structures.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   We have finer resolution robots that can build micro mechanical systems.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   So robots that can build robots
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   that can walk and manipulate.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.600]   And we're just now,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   we have a project at the layer below that
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   where there's endless attention today to billion dollar chip fab investments.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.600]   But a really interesting thing we passed through is
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   today the smallest transistors you can buy as a single transistor,
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   just commercially for electronics,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   is actually the size of an early transistor in an integrated circuit.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   So we're using these machines making machines,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   making assemblers to place those parts
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   to not use a billion dollar chip fab to make integrated circuits,
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   but actually assemble little electronic components.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   So have a fine enough, precise enough actuators and manipulators
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.600]   that allow you to place these transistors.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   Right. That's a research project in my lab
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   called DICE, on discrete assembly of integrated electronics.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   And we're just at the point
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   to really start to take seriously this notion of
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   not having a chip fab make
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   integrated electronics,
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   but having not a 3D printer,
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.600]   but a thing that's a cross between
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   a pick and place makes circuit boards in 2D.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   The 3D printer extrudes in 3D.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   We're making sort of a micro manipulator
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   that acts like a printer,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   but it's placing to build electronics in 3D.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.600]   But this micro manipulator is distributed.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   So there's a bunch of them
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   or is this one centralized thing?
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   So that's why that's a great question.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   So I have a prize that's almost,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   but not been claimed for the students
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.600]   whose thesis can walk out of the printer.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.600]   Oh, nice.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   So you have to print the thesis
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   with the means to exit the printer
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   and it has to contain its description
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   of the thesis that says how to do that.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   It's a really good,
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   I mean, it's a fun example of exactly the thing we're talking about.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   And I've had a few students almost get to that.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   And so in what I'm describing,
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   there's the stack where we're getting closer,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   but it's still quite a few years to really go from us.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.600]   So there's a layer below the transistors
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   where we assemble the base materials
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   that become the transistor.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   We're now just at the edge of assembling the transistors
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   to make the circuits.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.600]   We can assemble the micro parts to make the micro robots.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.600]   We can assemble the bigger robots.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   And in the coming years,
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   we'll be patching together all of those scales.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   So do you see a vision of just endless,
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   billions of robots at different scales,
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.600]   self-assembling, self-replicating
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.600]   and building complicated structures?
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   Yes.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.600]   And the but to the yes but is,
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   let me clarify two things.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   One is that immediately raises King Charles fear
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   of gray goo, of runaway mutant self-reproducing things.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   The reason why there are many things
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   I can tell you to worry about,
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   but that's not one of them,
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   is if you want things to autonomously self-reproduce
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   and take over the world,
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   that means they need to compete with nature
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   on using the resources of nature,
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   of water and sunlight.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   And in light of everything I'm describing,
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.600]   biology knows everything I told you.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   Every single thing I explain,
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   biology already knows how to do.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   What I'm describing isn't new for biology.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   It's new for non-biological systems.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   So in the digital era,
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   the economic win ended up being centralized,
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   the big platforms.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   In this world of machines that can make machines,
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   I'm asked, for example,
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   what's the killer opportunity?
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   Who's going to make all the money?
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   Who to invest in?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   But if the machine can make the machine,
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   it's not a great business to invest in the machine.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   In the same way that if you can produce,
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   if you can think globally,
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   but produce locally,
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   then the way the technology goes out into society
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   isn't a function of central control,
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   but is fundamentally distributed.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   Now, that raises an obvious kind of concern,
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   which is, well, doesn't this mean
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   you could make bombs and guns and all of that?
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   The reason that's much less of a problem
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   than you would think
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.600]   is making bombs and guns and all of that
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   is a very well-met market need.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   Anywhere we go,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   there's a fine supply chain for weapons.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.600]   Now, hobbyists have been making guns for ages,
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.600]   and guns are available just about anywhere.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.600]   So you could go into the lab and make a gun.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   Today, it's not a very good gun,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   and guns are easily available.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   And so generally,
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   we've run these lab and war zones.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   What we find is people don't go to them to make weapons,
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600]   which you can already do anyway.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   It's an alternative to making weapons.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   Coming back to your question,
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   I'd say the single most important thing I've learned
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.600]   is the greatest natural resource of the planet
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   is this amazing density of bright and vent of people
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   whose brains are underused.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   And you could view the social engineering of this lab work
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   as creating the capacity for them.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   And so in the end,
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   the way this is going to impact society
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   isn't going to be command and control.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   It's how the world uses it.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   And it's been really gratifying for me to see
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   just how it does.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   - Yeah, but what are the different ways
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.600]   the evolution of the exponential scaling
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   of digital fabrication can evolve?
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:56.600]   So you said, yeah, self-replicating nanobots, right?
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   This is the Grey Goo fear.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   It's a caricature of a fear.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   But nevertheless, there's interesting,
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.600]   just like you said, spam,
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   and all these kinds of things that came with
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   the scaling of communication and computation.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.600]   What are the different ways that malevolent actors,
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   will use this technology?
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   - Yeah, well, first let me start with a benevolent story,
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:23.600]   which is trash is an analog concept.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.600]   There's no trash in a forest.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.600]   All the parts get disassembled and reused.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.600]   Trash means something doesn't have enough information
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.600]   to tell you how to reuse it.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   It's as simple as there's no trash in a Lego room.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   When you assemble Lego,
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   the Lego bricks have enough information
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   to disassemble them.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   So as you go through this Fab 1234 story,
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.600]   one of the implications of this transition
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   from printing to assembling.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   So the real breakthrough technologically
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.600]   isn't additive versus subtractive,
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   which is a subject of a lot of attention and hype.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   3D printers are useful.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   We spun off companies like Formlabs,
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   led by Max for 3D printing.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   But in a Fab lab,
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.600]   it's one of maybe 10 machines.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.600]   It's used, but it's only part of the machines.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   The real technological change
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.600]   is when we go from printing and cutting
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   to assembling and disassembling.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   But that reduces inventories
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   of hundreds of thousands of parts
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.600]   to just having a few parts to make almost anything.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   It reduces global supply chains
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.600]   to locally sourcing these building blocks.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   But one of the key implications
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   is it gets rid of technological trash
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   because you can disassemble
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.600]   and reuse the parts,
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   not throw them away.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   And so initially that's of interest
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   for things at the end of long supply chains
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   like satellites on orbit.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   But one of the things coming
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   is eliminating technical trash
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.600]   through reuse of the building blocks.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   - So like when you think about 3D printers,
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   you're thinking about addition and subtraction.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   When you think about the other options available to you
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   in that parameter space, as you call it,
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   that's going to be assembly,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   disassembly, cutting, you said?
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.600]   - So the 1952 NC Mill was subtractive.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.600]   You remove material.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   And 3D printing additive,
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   and there's a couple claims
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   to the invention of 3D printing,
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   that's closer to what's called net shape,
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   which is you don't have to cut away
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   the material you don't need.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   You just put material where you do need it.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   And so that's the 3D printing revolution.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   But there are all sorts of limitations
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   on 3D printing
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   to the kinds of materials you can print,
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.600]   the kind of functionality you can print.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.600]   We're just not going to get to making
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   everything in a cell phone on a single printer.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   But I do expect to make everything
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.600]   in a cell phone with an assembler.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   And so instead of printing and cutting technologically,
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   it's this transition to assembling and disassembling.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   Going back to Shannon and von Neumann,
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   going back to the ribosome four billion years ago.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   Now you come to malevolent.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   Let me tell you a story
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   about I was doing a briefing
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.600]   for the National Academy of Sciences group
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.600]   that advises the intelligence communities.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.600]   And I talked about the kind of research we do.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   And at the very end,
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.600]   I showed a little video clip of Valentina in Ghana,
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   a local girl making surface mount electronics
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   in the Fab Lab.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   And I showed that to this room full of people.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   And one of the members of the intelligence community
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   got up livid and said,
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   "How dare you waste our time showing us a young girl
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   "in an African village making surface mount electronics.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.600]   "We're looking at,
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.600]   "we need to know about disruptive threats
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   "to the future of the United States."
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   And somebody else got up in the room and yelled at him,
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.600]   and, "You idiot.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   "I can't think of anything more important than this."
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   But for two reasons.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   One reason was because, you know,
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.600]   because if we rely on like informational superiority
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.600]   in the battlefield,
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.600]   it means other people could get access to it.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.600]   But this intelligence person's point, bless him,
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   wasn't that.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   It was getting at the root causes of conflict
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   is if this young girl in an African village
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   could actually master surface mount electronics,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   it changes some of the most fundamental things
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.600]   about recruitment for terrorism,
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   impact of economic migration,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   basic assumptions about an economy.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   It's just existential for the future of the planet.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   - But, you know, we've just lived through a pandemic.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   I would love to linger on this
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.600]   'cause the possibilities that are positive are endless.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   But the possibilities that are negative
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   are still nevertheless extremely important.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   Well, it's both positive and negative.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.600]   What do you do with a large number of general assemblers?
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   - Yeah.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600]   With the Fab Lab,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   you could roughly make a bio lab,
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600]   then learn biotechnology.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.600]   Now that's terrifying
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.600]   because making self-reproducing gray goo
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.600]   that outcompetes biology,
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   I consider doomed because biology knows everything
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.600]   I'm describing and is really good at what it does.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   In "How to Grow Almost Anything,"
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   you learn skills in biotechnology
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   that let you make serious biological threats.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   - And when you combine some of the innovations
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   you see with large language models,
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   some of the innovations you see with AlphaFold,
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   so applications of AI for designing biological systems,
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   for writing programs,
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.600]   which you can with large language models increasingly.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.600]   So there seems to be an interesting dance here
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   of automating the design stage of complex systems using AI.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   And then that's the bit.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   That's the bits.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   And you can leap.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.600]   Now, the innovations you're talking about,
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   you can leap from the complex systems in the digital space
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   to the printing,
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   to the creation,
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   to the assembly
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   at scale of complex systems in the physical space.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   - Yeah.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   So something to be scared about is
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   a Fab Lab can make a bio lab,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   a bio lab can make biotechnology,
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   somebody could learn to make a virus.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.600]   That's scary.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.600]   That's unlike some of the things I said,
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.600]   I don't worry about.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   That's something I really worry about.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   That is scary.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   Now, how do you deal with that?
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   Prior threats, we dealt with command and control.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   So like early color copiers had unique codes
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   and you could tell which copier made them.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   Eventually you couldn't keep up with that.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   There was a famous meeting at Asilomar
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   in the early days of recombinant DNA,
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   where that community recognized the dangers
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   of what it was doing and put in place a regime
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.600]   to help manage it.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   And so that led to the kind of research management.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   So MIT has an office that supervises research
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   and it works with the national office.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   That works if you can identify who's doing it and where.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   It doesn't work in this world we're describing.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.600]   So anybody could do this anywhere.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   And so what we found is you can't contain this.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600]   It's already out.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.600]   You can't forbid because there isn't command and control.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   The most useful thing you can do is provide incentives
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   for transparency.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   So, but really the heart of what we do is you could do this
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   by yourself in a basement for nefarious reasons
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   or you could come into a place in the light
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600]   where you get help
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   and you get community and you get resources.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   And there's an incentive to do it in the open,
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   not in the dark.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   And that might sound naive,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   but in the sort of places we're working,
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   you know, again, bad people do bad things
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   in these places already,
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   but providing openness and providing transparency
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.600]   is a key part of managing these.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.600]   And so it transitions from regulating risks
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   as regulation to soft power to manage them.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   - So there's so much potential for good,
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   so much capacity for good that Fab Labs
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   and the ability and the tools of creation
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   really unlock that potential.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   - Yeah.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   And I don't say that as sort of dewy-eyed naive.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   I say that empirically from just years of seeing
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   how this plays out in communities.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   - I wonder if it's the early days of personal computers
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   though before we get spam, right?
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   - In the end, most fundamentally,
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   literally the mother of all problems
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   is who designed us.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.600]   So assume success
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600]   and that we're gonna transition
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   to the machines making machines
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   and all of these new sort of social systems we're describing
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   will help manage them and curate them
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   and democratize them.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   If we close the gap I just led off with
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.600]   of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   between ChipFab and you,
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   we're ultimately in marrying communication,
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   computation and fabrication
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   gonna be able to create unimaginable complexity.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.600]   And how do you design that?
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   And so I'd say the deepest of all questions
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   that I've been working on
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   is goes back to the oldest part of our genome.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   So in our genome, what are called Hox genes,
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   and these are morphogenes.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   And nowhere in your genome is the number five.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.600]   It doesn't store the fact that you have five fingers.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   What it stores is what's called a developmental program.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   It's a series of steps.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   And the steps have the character of like
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.600]   grow up a gradient or break symmetry.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   And at the end of that developmental program,
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   you have five fingers.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   So you are stored not as a body plan,
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   but as a growth plan.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.600]   And there's two reasons for that.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   One reason is just compression.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.600]   Billions of genes can be stored
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   and billions of genes can place trillions of cells.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   But the much deeper one is evolution doesn't randomly perturb.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   Almost anything you did randomly in the genome
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   would be fatal or inconsequential, but not interesting.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   But when you modify things in these developmental programs,
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   you go from like webs for swimming to fingers,
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   or you go from walking to wings for flying.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   It's a space in which search is interesting.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   So this is the heart of the success of AI.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   In part, it was the scaling we talked about a while ago.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   And in part, it was the representations
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   for which search is effective.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   AI has found good representations.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   It hasn't found new ways to search,
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   but it's found good representations of search.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   And you're saying that's what biology,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.600]   that's what evolution has done.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   It's created representations, structures,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.600]   biological structures through which search is effective.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   And so the developmental programs in the genome
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.600]   beautifully encapsulate the lessons of AI.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.600]   And it's molecular intelligence.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.600]   It's AI embodied in our genome.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   It's every bit as profound as the cognition in our brain,
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   but now this is sort of thinking
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.600]   in molecular thinking in how you design.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.600]   And so I'd say the most fundamental problem
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   we're working on is it's kind of tautological
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.600]   that when you design a phone, you design the phone.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.600]   You represent the design of the phone.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   But that actually fails when you get to the sort of complexity
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600]   that we're talking about.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   And so there's this profound transition to come.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.600]   Once I can have self-reproducing assemblers placing 10 to the 18 percent,
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   and 10 to the 18 parts,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   you need to not sort of metaphorically,
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   but create life in that you need to learn how to evolve.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   But evolutionary design has a really misleading, trivial meaning.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   It's not as simple as you randomly mutate things.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   It's this much more deep embodiment of AI and morphogenesis.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   Is there a way for us to continue
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   the kind of evolutionary design that led us to this place
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   from the early days of bacteria, single-cell organism,
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   to ribosomes and the 20 amino acids?
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   You mean for human augmentation?
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   For life augment.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.600]   I mean, what would you call assemblers
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600]   that are self-replicating and placing parts?
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   What is that?
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   The dynamic complex things built with digital fabrication,
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.600]   what is that?
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   That's life.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   Yeah, so ultimately, absolutely,
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   if you add up everything I'm talking about,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.600]   it's building up to creating life in non-living materials.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   Yes.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.600]   And I don't view this as copying life.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.600]   I view it as deriving life.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.600]   I didn't start from how does biology work
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   and then I'm going to copy it.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.600]   I start from how to solve problems
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.600]   and then it leads me to, in a sense, rediscover biology.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   So if you go back to Valentina in Ghana making her circuit board,
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.600]   she still needs a chip fab very far away
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.600]   to make the processor on her circuit board.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   For her to make the processor locally,
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.600]   for all the reasons we described,
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.600]   you actually need the deep things we were just talking about.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.600]   And so it really does lead you.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.600]   So let's see.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.600]   There's a wonderful series of books by Gingery.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.600]   Book one is How to Make a Charcoal Furnace.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.600]   And at the end of book seven, you have a machine shop.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:49.600]   So it's sort of how you do your own personal industrial revolution.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.600]   ISRU is what NASA calls in situ resource utilization.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   And that's how do you go to a planet and create a civilization.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.600]   ISRU has essentially assumed Gingery.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.600]   You go through the industrial revolution
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.600]   and you create the inventory of 100,000 resistors.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.600]   What we're finding is the minimum building blocks for a civilization
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.600]   is roughly 20 parts.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   So what's interesting about the amino acids
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   is they're not interesting.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.600]   They're hydrophobic or hydrophilic, basic or acidic.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   They have typical but not extremal properties,
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.600]   but they're good enough you can combine them to make you.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.600]   So what this is leading towards is technology doesn't need
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.600]   enormous global supply chains.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.600]   It just needs about 20 properties you can compose
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.600]   to create all technology.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.600]   And that's what Gingery is all about.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.600]   It's about creating all technology as the minimum building blocks
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.600]   for a technological civilization.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.600]   So there's going to be 20 basic building blocks
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.600]   based on which the self-replicating assemblers can work.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600]   Right.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.600]   And I say that not philosophically, just empirically.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.600]   That's where it's heading.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:03.600]   And I like thinking about how you bootstrap a civilization on Mars,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   that problem.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   There's a fun video on bonus material for the movie
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.600]   with a neat group of people.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   We talk about it because it has really profound implications
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   back here on Earth about how we live sustainably.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.600]   What does that civilization on Mars look like that's using ISRU,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   that's using these 20 building blocks and does self-assembly?
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   Yeah, go through primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.600]   You extract properties like conducting, insulating,
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.600]   semiconducting, magnetic, dielectric,
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600]   flexural.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.600]   These are the kind of roughly 20 properties.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:50.600]   With those, those are enough for us to assemble logic
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.600]   and they're enough for us to assemble actuation.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   With logic and actuation, we can make micro robots.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.600]   The micro robots can build bigger robots.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.600]   The bigger robots can then take the building block materials
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:12.600]   and make the structural elements that you then do to make construction.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.600]   And then you boot up through the stages of a technological civilization.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.600]   By the way, where in the span of logic and actuation
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.600]   did the sensing come in?
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.600]   Oh, I skipped over that.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.600]   But my favorite sensor is a step response.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.600]   So if you just make a step and measure the response
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.600]   to the electric field that ranges from user interfaces
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.600]   to positioning to material properties,
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.600]   and if you do it at higher frequencies, you get chemistry.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.600]   And you can get all of that just from a step in an electric field.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.600]   So for example, once you have time resolution in logic,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:57.600]   something as simple as two electrodes let you do amazingly capable sensing.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.600]   So we've been talking about all the work I do.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.600]   There's a story about how it happens.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.600]   Where do ideas come from?
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.600]   That's an interesting story.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   Where do ideas come from?
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.600]   So I had mentioned Vannevar Bush.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   And he wrote a really influential thing called the Endless Frontier.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.600]   So science won World War II.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.600]   The more known story is nuclear bombs.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.600]   The less well-known story is the Rad Lab.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.600]   So at MIT, an amazing group of people invented radar,
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   which is really credited as winning the war.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.600]   So after the war, a grand old man from MIT
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.600]   was charged with science won the war.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.600]   How do we maintain that edge?
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.600]   And the report he wrote led to the National Science Foundation
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   and the modern notion we take for granted
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:01.600]   but didn't really exist before then of public funding of research or research agencies.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.600]   In it, he made--
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.600]   again, what I consider an important mistake,
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:13.600]   which is he described basic research leads to applied research,
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.600]   leads to applications, leads to commercialization, leads to impact.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.600]   And so we need to invest in that pipeline.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.600]   The reason I consider it a mistake
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:32.600]   is almost all of the examples we've been talking about in my lab went backwards,
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.600]   that the basic research came from applications.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:42.600]   And further, almost all of the examples we've been talking about
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.600]   came fundamentally from mistakes.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   So--
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.600]   Essentially, everything I've ever worked on has failed.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.600]   But in failing, something better happened.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   So the way I like to describe it is, you know,
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   ready, aim, fire is you do your homework.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.600]   You aim carefully at something--a target you want to accomplish.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.600]   And if everything goes right, you then hit the target and succeed.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.600]   What I do, you can think of as ready, fire, aim.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   So you do a lot of work to get ready.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   Then you close your eyes,
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   and you don't really think about where you're aiming,
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   but you look very carefully at where you did aim,
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.600]   where you--you aim after you fire.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   And the reason that's so important is--
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.600]   If you do ready, aim, fire, there's--the best you can hope is hit what you aim at.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600]   So let me give you some examples.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.600]   Because this is a source of great--
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.600]   You're full of good lines today.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600]   Source of great frustration.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.600]   So I mentioned the early quantum computing.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.600]   So quantum computing is this power of using quantum mechanics
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.600]   to make computers that, for some problems,
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.600]   are dramatically more powerful than classical computers.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.600]   So quantum computing is a very powerful tool.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.600]   It's a very powerful tool for making quantum computers.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.600]   Before it started, there was a really interesting group of people
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.600]   who knew a lot about physics and computing

[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.600]   Mm-hmm.

[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:46.800]   And so biology trivially uses quantum mechanics that were made out of atoms, but the distinction
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:53.320]   is in quantum computing, quantum information, you need quantum coherence.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:59.160]   And there's a lot of muddled thinking about like collapse of the wave function and claims
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:07.280]   of quantum computing that garbles just quantum coherence.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:07.400]   You can think of it as a quantum machine.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   Mm-hmm.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:12.840]   You can think of it as a wave that has very special properties, but these wave-like properties.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:20.240]   And so there's a small set of places where biology uses quantum mechanics in that deeper
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240]   sense.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240]   Mm-hmm.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.460]   One is how light is converted to energy in photo systems.
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:33.940]   It looks like one is olfaction, how your nose is able to tell different smells.
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:37.200]   Probably one has to do with how birds navigate.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.960]   How they sense magnetic fields.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.640]   That involves a coupling between a very weak energy with a magnetic field, coupling
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.160]   into chemical reactions.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.040]   And there's a beautiful system.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.040]   It...
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:58.580]   Standard in chemistry is magnetic fields like this can influence chemistry, but there are
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:03.340]   biological circuits that are carefully balanced with two pathways that become unbalanced with
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.660]   magnetic fields.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:07.000]   So each of these areas are expensive.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.240]   So for biology, it has to consume resources to use quantum mechanics in this way.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.240]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.940]   So again, those are places where we know there's quantum mechanics in biology.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:22.560]   In cognition, there's just no evidence.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:29.760]   There's no evidence of anything quantum mechanical going on in how cognition works.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760]   Consciousness.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.180]   Well, I'm saying cognition.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.180]   I'm not saying consciousness.
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.180]   Okay.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.800]   But to get from cognition to consciousness...
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800]   ...there's a lot of evidence.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:41.800]   So McCullough and Pitts made a model of neurons.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.800]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:51.300]   That led to perceptrons that then through a couple boom busts led to deep learning.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:55.820]   One of the interesting things about that sequence is it diverged off.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:02.160]   So deep neural networks used in machine learning diverged from trying to understand how the
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.080]   brain works.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.600]   What makes them work...
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.380]   What's emerged is...
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.860]   It's a really interesting story.
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:17.300]   This may be too much of a technical detail, but it has to do with function approximation.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:18.620]   We talked about exponentials.
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:27.600]   A deep network needs an exponentially larger shallow network to do the same function.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   That exponential is what gives the power to deep networks.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.400]   But what's interesting is the sort of lessons about building these deep archetypes.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:43.460]   The architectures and how to train them have really interesting echoes to how brains work.
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:48.420]   And there's an interesting conversation that's sort of coming back of neuroscientists looking
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:52.800]   over the shoulder of people training these deep networks, seeing interesting echoes for
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.780]   how the brain works, interesting parallels with it.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.580]   And so I didn't say consciousness.
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.820]   I just said cognition.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:06.180]   But I don't know any experimental evidence that points to anything.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:10.440]   I think there's something in neurobiology that says we need quantum mechanics.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:24.900]   And I view the question about whether a large language model is conscious as silly in that
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:30.900]   biology is full of hacks and it works.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:35.960]   There's no evidence we have that there's anything deeper going on than just this sort of...
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.300]   stacking up of hacks in the brain.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.580]   And somehow consciousness is one of the hacks or an emerging property of the hacks.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:43.580]   Absolutely.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:50.840]   And just numerically, I said big computations now have the degrees of freedom of the brain.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:56.300]   And they're showing a lot of the phenomenology of what we think is properties of what a brain
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.000]   can do.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.500]   And I don't see any reason to invoke anything else.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.740]   That makes you wonder what kind of beautiful stuff digital fabrication will create.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:12.540]   If biology created a few hacks on top of which consciousness and cognition, some of the things
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:15.740]   we love about human beings was created.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:22.040]   It makes you wonder what kind of beauty in the complexity created the digital fabrication.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:29.860]   There's an early peak at that, which is there's a misleading term, which is generative design.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.860]   Generative design is where you don't tell a computer how to design something.
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.520]   You tell the computer what you want it to do.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.120]   That doesn't work.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:41.060]   That only works in limited subdomains.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.100]   You can't do really complex functionality that way.
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:48.620]   The one place it's matured though is topology optimization for structure.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:53.700]   So let's say you wanted to make a bicycle or a table.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:58.060]   You describe the loads on it and it figures out how to design it.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:01.660]   And what it makes are beautiful, organic looking things.
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:05.300]   These are things that look like they grew in a forest.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.060]   They look like they grew in a forest because that's sort of exactly what they are.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:14.180]   That they're solving the ways of how you handle loads in the same way biology does.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:17.880]   And so you get things that look like trees and shells and all of that.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:26.160]   And so that's a peak at this transition from we design to we teach the machines how to
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.160]   design.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:31.080]   What can you say about, because you mentioned cellular automata earlier, about
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:35.080]   from this example you just gave and in general the observation you can make by looking at
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.680]   cellular automata that there's a, from simple rules and simple building blocks can emerge
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.560]   arbitrary complexity.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:48.800]   Do you understand what that is, how that can be leveraged?
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.280]   So understand what it is is much easier than it sounds.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:59.280]   I complained about Turing's machine making a physics mistake, but Turing never intended
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.700]   it to be a computer architecture.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:04.860]   He used it just to prove results about understanding.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.140]   So uncomputability.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:13.080]   What Turing did on what is computation is exquisite, it's gorgeous.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.640]   He gave us our notion of computational universality.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:25.700]   And something that sounds deep and turns out to be trivial is it's really easy to show
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.380]   almost everything is computationally universal.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:33.340]   So Norm Margulis wrote a beautiful paper.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.660]   What is it?
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:36.280]   It's a kind of a very simple question.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:37.280]   I think it's a good one.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   I don't know if you've ever seen it.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.280]   It's a good, it's a good question.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280]   It's a good question, but I'm not sure if I've ever seen it.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   It's a good question.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.280]   And I think it's a good question.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:50.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:55.280]   I think it's a good question.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:02.640]   To be universal, you need a persistent state, you need a nonlinear operation to interact
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:08.480]   them, and you need connectivity.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.520]   So that's what you need to show computational universality.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:17.680]   So they showed that a CA modeling billiard balls is a universal computer.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:25.080]   Chris Moore went on to show that instead of chaos, let's see, Turing showed there are
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:30.260]   computable, there are problems in computation that you can't solve, that they're harder
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.400]   than you can't predict.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.160]   They're actually in a deep reason that they are unsolvable.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.200]   Chris Moore showed it's very easy to make physical systems that are uncomputable, that
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.420]   what the physics system does, just bouncing balls and surfaces, you can make systems that
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.100]   solve uncomputable problems.
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:53.880]   And so almost any non-trivial physical system is computationally universal.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:00.620]   So the first part of the answer to your question is, this comes back to my comment about how
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:03.680]   do you bootstrap a civilization.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.900]   You just don't need much to be computationally universal.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:16.360]   So then there isn't today a notion of fabricational universality or fabricational complexity.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:24.200]   The sort of numbers I've been giving you about you eating lunch versus the chip fab, that's
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:26.740]   in the same spirit of what Shannon did.
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:35.440]   But once you connect computational universality to kind of fabricational universality, you
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.240]   then get the ability to grow and adapt and evolve.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.560]   Because that evolution happens in the physical space, and that's ultimately-
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:49.900]   And so that's why, for me, the heart of this whole conversation is morphogenesis.
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:54.000]   So just to come back to that.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:05.760]   What Turing ended his sadly cut short life studying was how genes give rise to form.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:11.640]   So how the small amount of it, relatively, in effect, small amount of information in
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.960]   the genome can give rise to the complexity of who you are.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:23.800]   And that's where what resides is this molecular intelligence, which is first how to describe it.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:29.540]   And then how to describe you, but then how to describe you such that you can exist and
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.700]   you can reproduce and you can grow and you can evolve.
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:38.880]   And so that's the seat of our molecular intelligence.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.300]   The maker revolution in biology.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:44.540]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:45.540]   It really is.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:51.040]   And that's where you can't separate communication, computation, and fabrication.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.600]   You can't separate computer science and physical science.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.800]   You can't separate hardware and software.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:59.440]   They all intersect right at that place.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.400]   Do you think of our universe as just one giant computation?
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:10.360]   I would even kind of say quantum computing is overhyped in that there's a few things
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.200]   quantum computing is going to be good at.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.840]   One is breaking cryptosystems, but we know how to make new cryptosystems.
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.800]   What it's really good at is modeling other quantum systems.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:23.400]   So for studying nanotechnology, it's going to be powerful.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:29.240]   But quantum computing is not going to disrupt and change everything.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:35.620]   But the reason I say that is this interesting group of strange people who helped invent
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:40.520]   quantum computing before it was clear anything was there.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.520]   One of the main reasons they did it wasn't to make a computer that can break a cryptosystem.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.900]   It was you could turn this backwards.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.400]   You could be surprised quantum mechanics can compute.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.200]   Or you can go in the opportunity.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:48:00.300]   You can go in the opposite direction and say if quantum mechanics can compute, that's a
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.980]   description of nature.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:08.660]   So physics is written in terms of partial differential equations.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:17.920]   That is an information technology from two centuries ago.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:23.000]   The equations of physics are not...this would sound very strange to say, but the
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.500]   equations of physics, Schrodinger's equations and Maxwell's equations and all of them are
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.500]   not fundamental.
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:34.540]   They're a representation of physics that was accessible to us in the era of having a pencil
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:38.460]   and a piece of paper.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:45.900]   They have a fundamental problem, which is if you make a dot on a piece of paper, in
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:52.800]   traditional physics theory, there's infinite information in that dot.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:57.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:58.300]   information in that dot.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:48:59.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:01.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:02.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:05.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:09.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:10.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:11.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:12.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:15.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:16.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:18.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:19.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:20.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.300]   information in that dot.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.300]   If you make a dot on a piece of paper, in traditional physics theory, there's infinite
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:24.300]   information in that dot.
