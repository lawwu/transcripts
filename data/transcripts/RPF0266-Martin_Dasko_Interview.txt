[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.640]   Today's the day before Thanksgiving, Wednesday in the United States anyway.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.040]   And what that means is let's have a fun show.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.680]   I'm going to release an interview today and we're going to talk about how you can build
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.920]   financial independence in your twenties without missing a party.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.960]   No heavy lifting here.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   No really intellectual stuff that you got to dig deep in.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.280]   Rather, we're going to talk about how do you save money at the bar and how do you not go
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.080]   broke when you're trying to party.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.400]   Sit back, relax, and let's have some fun today.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:01:02.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.240]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm going to try to give you a fun one today.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.880]   My guest is a man named Martin Dasko.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.840]   Martin's a really great guy.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200]   He writes a website called studenomics.com.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.960]   You'll hear his story in just a few minutes.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.400]   But how's this for fun?
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.280]   Not only is he talking about finance, but he's used his financial independence to become
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.080]   an aspiring professional wrestler.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.520]   I was trying to think.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.400]   My brain just blanked.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.600]   Martin, I think your stage name is The Latin Lover, something like that.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.000]   I just blanked all of a sudden.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.200]   But Martin's a really fun guy.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.400]   I first met him a year ago at FinCon 2014.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.120]   I met him and started connecting with his stuff.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.040]   I hadn't previously been aware of his work.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.400]   And then this year when we were at FinCon 2015, I decided to invite him on the show.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.160]   And I thought it'd be really fun because he started his financial blog when he was in
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.080]   his 20s, in college.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.520]   And he's got some insights into helping people to set their lives up well in college.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.560]   And I'm hoping this show can be something that'll be fun, something that you can share
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.440]   with other people who are in college or who are going into college because your young
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.040]   adult years are years in which you can either set yourself up for a lifetime of success
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.760]   or they are years in which you can set yourself up for many years, perhaps even decades of
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.720]   drudgery.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.320]   And yet it's not that difficult to go with option A and set yourself up for success.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.160]   All it takes is making a few simple decisions well.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.480]   So before we get to the interview though, let's talk about sponsors for today.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.520]   Sponsor number one is Paladin Registry.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.640]   Paladin Registry is my solution to the most requested – the most often – the thing
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.720]   that people ask me more than anything else, which is, "Joshua, how do I find a financial
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.440]   advisor?"
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.760]   My hope is that Radical Personal Finance can help open up the curtains a little bit on
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.200]   the financial planning business.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.640]   So I talk to financial advisors.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.280]   I try to share some of my experiences and hope I can help you to see where a financial
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.720]   advisor can be useful and where a financial advisor cannot be useful.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.200]   Originally, I was going to try to create my own financial advisory firm and serve some
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.400]   of you guys in that capacity.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.120]   But I realized that's not the best use of my time.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.280]   So I was trying to figure out how can I bring someone else on the show that I could send
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.920]   you guys to.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.200]   Paladin Registry is my best effort to be able to do that.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.520]   Paladin Registry is a financial advisor referral service.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   It's not like a pay-to-play thing where every advisor just comes and gets in.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680]   Rather, it's a registry and you have to meet certain strict criteria in order to gain
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.600]   entrance to the registry.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.880]   So the founder, Jack Wehmeyer, built these tests and criteria to keep people basically
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.960]   transparent, accountable, to try to bring to you the best options for you.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.280]   If you're interested in all the details of that, go back and listen to episode 248 of
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.600]   the show.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.520]   It's an in-depth interview with Jack where we talk in detail, completely transparent
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.840]   about every aspect of the registry.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   Then if you're looking for a financial advisor, if you don't have one or you'd like to
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:20.080]   check and see if there's a better option available for you, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.960]   That link will pass you through to a page where you'll put in your information.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.840]   You'll put in a name, your zip code, your phone number, email address, and you'll put
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.040]   in the amount of assets that you have potentially to manage.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.640]   That's important so that they can filter.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.480]   For example, if you've got a million dollars, they'll filter out some of the ones who
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   only accept minimums of $3 million.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.680]   Or if you've got $300,000, they'll filter out people appropriately.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.280]   So go ahead and put that information in there as well.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.320]   It's important.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.360]   Then what they will do is they'll take that and they'll send you the information of
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.240]   several advisors.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.600]   Those advisors will contact you.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.880]   They'll try to connect with you.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.480]   They'll meet with you and you can interview them to see if any of them can serve you.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.400]   So please check that out.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.800]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/paladin.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.720]   The feedback so far has been excellent.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.080]   Those of you listeners who have used that have told me it's really good.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.240]   Most of you have met with two or three advisors and that way you had a range of options.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   Then the people who have given me feedback so far have usually found one that they started
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.440]   to have a good feeling about.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.800]   So check that out at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/paladin.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   Sponsor number two is Patrick Snow.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.160]   Patrick Snow is a publishing coach.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.840]   He is my publishing coach.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.200]   He's the guy that I hired to help me as I've been working on this book that I'm working
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.700]   on.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.440]   He's been a great guy and many of you guys in the audience, many of you guys and gals
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.240]   or listeners are entrepreneurs and I think you would be well served by considering writing
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.800]   a book.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.640]   Patrick is a world class expert at that.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.800]   Listen to episode 252 of the show which was the interview with him and then if you are
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.480]   interested in information helping him guide you through the pitfalls to do a good job
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.560]   and avoid all the mistakes of publishing a book, go to ThePublishingDoctor.com and get
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   in touch with him.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.160]   That's it.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.800]   Let's get right to it and have a little fun.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.240]   Martin, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.280]   I appreciate you being with me.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.720]   Thanks for finally having me on.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.560]   I'm glad we could make this happen.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.360]   So you've been in the finance blogging world for, wow, about forever, huh?
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.200]   Well, about seven years which in blogging years is forever because many blogs come and
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.960]   go or they give up when they're not a millionaire after six months.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.840]   I'm happy to have made it this long.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.520]   Your site is called studentonomics.com and so you primarily focus on student economics,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.000]   right?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.120]   That was how it started at least?
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.160]   Well, that's how it started.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.200]   It was 2008 and I was one of those guys that read about entrepreneurship, talked about
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.720]   it but never really did anything.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.760]   So I figured I had to do something.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.080]   So me and a buddy would meet up every day and we would talk about some business plan
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.680]   where we help people with their money.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.320]   It was essentially a personal finance blog on paper which probably wouldn't work because
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.200]   who reads on paper?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.280]   So every day we talked about it but this guy was even worse than me when it came to launch
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.840]   anxiety.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.920]   So nothing ever happened.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.840]   So finally I wanted to start a blog.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.360]   I just started writing articles.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.200]   I started reading personal finance sites and some of the people are here actually.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   So I reached out to these guys and one of the first people that responded was PT Money.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.760]   I said, "Hey, I sent like a generic template.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.880]   Don't do that.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.360]   I sent every single blogger the same template.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.040]   Like I like your site.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.000]   It is a good site.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.600]   Can I start a site?"
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.840]   Not even like, "Hello, Phil."
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.120]   Just like, "Hello, dear sir."
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.280]   So finally Phil told me you can make money blogging and people actually do this.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.280]   So then I said, like I said, I was writing, I was writing and then finally I read the
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   dough roller.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.800]   He's actually here.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.300]   Yep.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.920]   And he had a post on how to start a blog.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.600]   So I said, "I'm going to do this."
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.560]   So it was a Friday night.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   It was November 7, 2008.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.200]   I was at home.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.000]   I had nothing to do.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.240]   I said, "I got to do something about this."
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.840]   So I followed his easy steps and then apparently you needed a domain name.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.640]   So I said, "Well, I'm a student.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.000]   I help most people and why not student economics, Studonomics?"
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680]   I thought it was the most clever thing in the world.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.320]   I never even thought about Studonomics.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.240]   Sorry, not to spoil your branding, but I just always assumed it was student economics.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.840]   I never even thought of the play on words.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.160]   No.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.440]   So now I kind of go with it.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.040]   You know, I guess this won't help listeners, but my business card is a picture of me with
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.720]   my shirt open and I play with it.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.080]   It's Studonomics or it's Studentomics.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.280]   Depends who you are, you know?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.960]   I like it.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.800]   You look like quite the...
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   Who's the guy with the long hair that's really famous?
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.920]   Fazio or something?
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.560]   Fabio.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.280]   Fabio.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   He's a poor imitation.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.520]   So let's talk about student economics.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.440]   And what I'm interested in is you have an ability to write in a voice that is able to
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.520]   help a lot of people.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   And that's a voice that I just don't have.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.440]   You know, I'm the Mr. Stuffy financial planner and you've got the ability to connect with
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.560]   the people that are in that phase of life.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.640]   What do you focus on for people who are students in that, "Hey, we're in school.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.200]   We're trying to have a good time, but we're also trying to do smart stuff with our money."
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.920]   Where do you start?
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.640]   Well, so like, as I was saying earlier, the site started with me as a student and a stud,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:22.960]   I guess.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.840]   No, just kidding.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.920]   So the site grew with me.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.600]   So now I cover financial freedom in your 20s without missing a party.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   But so originally I started off with students.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.320]   So the one thing I wrote about that I really wanted to stress is that you don't have to
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   go into debt to get your degree.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.880]   And I think that's the biggest issue for most students right now is that they feel that,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.960]   "Oh, you know, I'm in school.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.160]   Nothing really matters right now.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.360]   Like I'll just rack up debt.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.320]   I shouldn't really work."
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.000]   I show people that if you don't get on top of your finances at an early age, it will
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.560]   ruin your life.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.720]   There's no other way to put it, right?
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.280]   Like you don't want to be in your 30s and stuck paying off debt or worrying about student
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.760]   loans or forced, even worse, you're forced to work a job that you hate just because you
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   financed an unrealistic lifestyle as a student.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.400]   So I started off by talking about, you know, paying off student loans while in school.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.880]   And I show you like, I'm not a boring guy.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.480]   You don't have to be some nerd who sits around all day and misses out on life to be
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.280]   financially free.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.640]   Not at all.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.760]   So I show people like, "Sure, you party on Friday night, but what did you do to earn
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.240]   that party?
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.920]   What did you do Monday to Friday?
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.960]   Do you have any student loans?
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.680]   Do you have any debt?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.640]   Are you making money?
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.880]   Are you using your skills to make some more money?"
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.520]   Because college is the best time to start making money.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.000]   Right.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.600]   You have nothing else to do all day, right?
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.360]   You can only party so much in the evening and classes only take what, 15 hours a week.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:45.600]   Exactly.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.040]   You've got plenty more time.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.280]   Did you go through school without debt?
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.880]   Yes, I finished with no debt.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.440]   So that...
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.080]   How'd you do that?
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.520]   Do you want the long story or the short story?
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.960]   Yeah, let's go with the medium story.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.680]   The medium story.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.440]   Go with the long story.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.160]   That's fine.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.840]   No, I mean, my one tip for anyone that wants to graduate debt-free is that you have to
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.640]   make one huge sacrifice at some point.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.400]   So my one huge sacrifice as a student was that I lived at home.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.040]   Okay.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.280]   I mean, it kind of killed my love life, as you can imagine, and my social life.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.520]   But on the plus side, I graduated debt-free.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.400]   So I was able to travel the world and do whatever I wanted.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.920]   Like, my friends are rushing to get jobs and I'm just, you know, blogging about personal
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.560]   finance.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.280]   Right.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.760]   So you have to start by making a huge sacrifice.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.400]   If you have to move away for school, that's cool.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.040]   Can you work?
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.080]   What I did was I lived at home and I worked crazy hours.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.760]   I took the bus to school.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.800]   I took the bus everywhere.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.400]   It wasn't sexy.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.960]   It wasn't cool.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.120]   You know, like I had my bus pass on me.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   I rode the bus for one hour every single day just to get to class.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.560]   But it wasn't so bad.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.680]   That's what I did all my studying.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.280]   So I rode the bus, took public transportation.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.680]   And you have to cut costs any way possible as a student.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   The best part about being a student is that it's cool to be broke.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.720]   Like, everyone expects you to be broke.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.400]   So take advantage of it.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.520]   Everywhere I went, I asked for a student discount.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.400]   No shame, you know.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.520]   And then the other thing is textbooks.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.520]   I did whatever it took to save money on textbooks.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.440]   If you buy every textbook new, I don't know what to tell you.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.000]   That's foolish.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.760]   I would say the best way is to go to the first couple of classes and see if you need,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.800]   even if you need the textbook, because you don't really need a textbook for every
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.440]   single class.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.400]   And then if you do need it, you can buy used.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.960]   You can buy, you can share with friends.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.240]   You can buy the online version.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.560]   You can find like an exchange program.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.160]   Most schools have an exchange program where like older students will sell it to younger
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.640]   students.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.200]   Really?
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.960]   You know, someone took the course, they'll sell it to you.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.120]   Do that because saving money on textbooks alone could be thousands of dollars.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.320]   So live at home, save money on textbooks and work.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.360]   I meet so many students that tell me, oh, I don't have time to work.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.600]   Come on, seriously.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.040]   Like who do you think you're talking to?
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.480]   I was there.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.200]   I was that guy.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.160]   There's time.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.120]   Unless, you know, unless you're becoming a doctor or an engineer, then I understand.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.520]   Because then, you know, you don't really have time for much.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:17.920]   Right.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.800]   But if you're just studying anything else but doctoring or engineering, get a job.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.200]   Right.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.520]   Work.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.160]   That's what I did.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.660]   I worked.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.320]   I worked part time hours.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.680]   I even worked on campus.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.880]   I was the guy that, I was an exam invigilator.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.640]   So what I did was I made sure you weren't cheating because you shouldn't be cheating.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.880]   So I worked on campus and I worked all the time.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.760]   And then during the summers, I got, I would get another job.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   I would do construction.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.400]   I would be a soccer referee.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.600]   Eventually, I started blogging.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.200]   I did.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.120]   I just worked, worked, worked because you're full of energy.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.480]   You have time and every dollar counts.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.960]   If you can, you know, get a job, make an extra hundred bucks a week.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.240]   Think about what that's going to do to your tuition and your debt that helps you.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   And finally, apply for free money.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.600]   It's unbelievable how much free money exists out there and we just don't apply for it.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.440]   For example, I ran into a buddy, you know, I was new on campus.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.800]   I'm like, where are you going?
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.920]   He goes, come for a walk.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.760]   I'm going to go apply for some bursaries.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.360]   So I had a four hour spare and I applied for bursaries.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.560]   All you have to do to apply for free money is write an essay.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.920]   What's a bursary?
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.440]   Oh, do you have like scholarships here?
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.000]   Okay, so that's the Canadian term?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.720]   Well, we have bursaries, like it's like a grant, a scholarship.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.680]   Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.720]   Right, grants and scholarships.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.120]   Got it.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.520]   Yeah, so grants and scholarships are amazing.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.360]   There's like funds out there that exist to give people money.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.280]   Nobody applies for it.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.240]   And I'm guilty of this too because sometimes I would see like, oh,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.200]   write an essay telling us why you deserve the scholarship.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.600]   I'd be like, eh, I don't know.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.680]   But if you think about it, writing an essay takes about like an hour.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.360]   It's like, nobody fights for the word essay.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:57.920]   Sure.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.720]   What is your job pay?
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.840]   $11 an hour.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.000]   Right.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.040]   Imagine you fill out this bursary and you get $200.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.000]   It's 200 bucks an hour.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.720]   That's not bad.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.360]   Right.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.160]   So that's what I did.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.640]   I filled out a bursary with this buddy.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.320]   I'm like, this seems like a scam.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.240]   He goes, no, nobody applies.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.960]   Just the grant exists.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.240]   They want to give money.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.560]   These are like, there's government funds, there's private funds.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   So I filled out this form.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.760]   I told them, hey, I'm poor.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.040]   Here's the proof.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.640]   I told them, you know, you guys are taking all my money.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.200]   I have no money.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.800]   I get an email.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.480]   I thought, oh my God, I'm going to get arrested.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.320]   They're going to, I'm going to get in trouble for fraud.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.040]   And they're like, your check is ready, sir.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.880]   I'm like, my check is ready.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   So I went to the student office and there's a check for $200.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.720]   I'm like, okay, I can do whatever I want with this.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   So I had $200.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.840]   Nice.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.320]   A girlfriend of mine, we're not dating anymore by the time,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.440]   she would fill out scholarships religiously.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.360]   And she was a minority.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.440]   So there was a fund for minorities and nobody applied for it.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.800]   They just figured out, I won't get it.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.440]   She applied.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   I forget the number, but it was like $4,000 that she got.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.160]   She redecorated her living room, but that's another story.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.520]   But still free money.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.680]   So if I can graduate debt free, anybody can.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.120]   I was out every Friday night.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.040]   I was always having fun.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.560]   I never missed out on anything.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.640]   I just, I worked, I lived at home.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.400]   I saved money on textbooks and I applied for scholarships.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.320]   And there's no greater feeling than being debt free in your early twenties.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.280]   Did you have financial goals at that time that went beyond simply graduating debt free?
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:35.600]   Yes.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   I told a buddy when I was 16, I said, I'm going to buy a condo before I buy a car.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.840]   I have no emotional story, no epiphany.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.800]   I was just a greedy kid.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.200]   And I was always kind of like a party guy.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.400]   So I always wanted to party.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.760]   I just wanted to have money for it.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.440]   So I told a buddy, I'm going to buy a condo.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.720]   So long story short, I bought a condo before I bought a car.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.480]   Luckily, I bought it from a developer.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.920]   So it was like, it wasn't really ready.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:11.280]   So I had to put down 5% on signing, 5% in a year and 5% on when I actually got the keys.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.880]   So 5% was not that much.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.920]   So I saved up and then I knew that I had to save up the next 5%.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.800]   Between us, I didn't have that money.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.160]   So hence why working kind of became a necessity because I had to pay or else I'd lose my other 5%.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.960]   So yeah, my goal was to get into real estate and I did.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.440]   I at 21, I got the keys to my condo.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.800]   Do you still live there?
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.520]   It was an adventure.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.880]   I sold it.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.000]   I made a nice profit.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.720]   I used it as a, I lived there for a year and I rented a room out to a friend.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.800]   It's more of a party mate.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.680]   We just went out all the time.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.280]   And then when I went to travel, I rented it out too.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.080]   I found tenants.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.000]   And then finally, I didn't like the building.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.360]   Like it was a nice building, but like the unit was, it was a loft.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.840]   It was a printing factory that turned into a loft.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   And for some reason, somebody wanted it.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.880]   They made a great offer.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.840]   I said, you know what?
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.880]   I want to buy more property.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.400]   So I sold it for a profit and now I'm buying more real estate.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   That's awesome.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.240]   You, after college, you just, the blog became your full-time income or what did you do then?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.480]   Well, everything in my life has been on the job training.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.560]   So when I started the blog, I, you know, like I said, I thought it was so cool.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.840]   You know, studentomics.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.040]   I'm like, what a clever name, right?
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.200]   Studenomics, you know, awesome.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   My design sucked.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.920]   Everything sucked.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   So finally, after one month, I got an email.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.520]   Someone says, I'll pay you 20 bucks for a link.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.040]   I'm like, you're paying me 20 bucks.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.680]   I've made it.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.240]   I'm on top of the world, right?
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.320]   So you can't really pay the bills of 20 bucks a month.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.440]   You know, you can cover your hosting.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.400]   So then from then, I would just write.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   I would just, you know, do normal things like talk to other bloggers, join forums, have a good time.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.480]   And then people would be like, I'd get emails like, can you write for us?
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.800]   And I just assumed that they wanted me to write for free.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.040]   So I was kind of like, eh, not really.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.720]   I didn't realize people wanted to hire me.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.440]   So I kind of like created a job, if that makes sense.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.840]   I started writing for other sites, like freelance writing, blog management.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.760]   I mean, I started in 2008.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.360]   So like all these like social media manager jobs that you see everywhere now,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.400]   those are new back then because there was no such thing as Twitter.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.880]   So you couldn't be a Twitter manager if there was no Twitter.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.240]   So I just kind of, it was all in the job training.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.840]   I would just start freelance writing.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.120]   Then I'd start selling more advertising space.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.160]   And then I built a blog and someone bought it from me.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.920]   I'm like, you want to buy a bunch of articles?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.360]   And because back in like 2010, 2011, people were buying sites.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.240]   That was the thing to do.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.880]   So I sold the site and it's all kind of been like a series of flukes and just me being in
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.000]   the right place at the right time.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And fortunately, I've been able just to do that and the real estate helped me.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.320]   And then just been writing and I've gone on to launch books and courses and here I am.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.800]   So you make all your money online?
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.040]   Well, you know, I got real estate and do some freelancing.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.640]   So it's yeah, it's all over the place.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.240]   Tell me about your travels.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.080]   So I'm actually the worst traveler out there.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.680]   Like most people, they go to like, they go backpacking for like a year.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.800]   They do all these cool things.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.680]   I don't like to be away from home.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.800]   I actually enjoy my life.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.000]   I do like, I do jujitsu.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.800]   I do pro wrestling.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.240]   I'm a member of two gyms.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.240]   I actually don't like to leave for long periods of time.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.720]   So my travels are actually shorter than most people's.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.160]   I'll go away for a couple of weeks.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.960]   I'll go away for, I like going away for weekends.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.880]   I like going to events, conferences.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.800]   I like going away with a purpose, you know?
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.360]   Right.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.760]   Because I'm sure it's fun to go traveling for a year, but I just, I just couldn't do it.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.240]   I just haven't, I want to do it one day, but I haven't done it.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.840]   So for me, I just go places and have fun.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.360]   So for example, like in 2011, I finished college.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.560]   I wanted to travel with a buddy because I didn't know he could travel alone.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.840]   I thought those people were weirdos, you know, like that guy's traveling alone.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.880]   He must have no friends.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.640]   So this guy kept on bailing and bailing, giving excuses.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.600]   I just booked a flight.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.480]   I booked a flight to Poland because I have a Polish background.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.000]   So I figured out I'll work on my Polish skills, right?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.200]   So I booked a trip and my parents thought I was insane.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.640]   They're like, why would you want to go alone?
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.520]   I said, I have to go.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.240]   So I thought, oh man, what am I going to do for three weeks alone?
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.400]   It's the longest trip I've ever been on.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.200]   So finally, I just, I just showed up.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.400]   No plan, nothing.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.240]   And I didn't realize what an amazing community backpackers are.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.120]   Like it's, it's like an underground society.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:59.040]   As soon as you get to one hostel, you meet so many friends.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.080]   You find out about all these cool places and I didn't know what I was going to do.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.560]   So I ended up in Poland and I went to Budapest and I've traveled around and I love it.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.240]   In 2013, I went to Argentina.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.000]   That was another adventure.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.200]   I went to work on my Spanish because I've been doing Spanish lessons.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.960]   But I realized that there's different kinds of Spanish.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.680]   And I also learned real fast that people talk fast.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.040]   So I thought I was ready to go.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.760]   I did these lessons and here I am like, hello, sir.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.960]   I walk on the street.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.800]   I got these like very complex sentences.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.240]   Where is the washroom?
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.560]   And it didn't go so well.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.640]   Tell me the story of this wrestling thing that you're doing.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.880]   So I spoke at an event last night, Ignite.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.800]   And when I first came to FinCon, you know, it was 2011.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.280]   FinCon is the conference we're at right now that we're talking about this in case you don't know.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.880]   So I met people that paid off debt.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.320]   They're living by the river.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.000]   You know, they're living in an RV.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   They're like traveling the world, doing all these things.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.840]   The only conference in the world where you're cool if you're living in an RV by the river
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.800]   and you spend no money.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.200]   It's like you measure it is one of the strange places in the world where in some ways it's
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.800]   all we're sitting around breakfast this morning and, you know, there's multiple millionaires at
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.400]   the table and they're like, yeah, you know, my house has been one hundred thousand dollars,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.640]   one hundred fifty thousand dollars on my house.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.440]   And it's the only place in the world where it's your badge of honor is how little you
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.040]   spend on your on your house and on your expenses.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.080]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:46.240]   So the one thing that kind of struck a chord with me was that sure, you're following your
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.360]   dreams by helping people.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.680]   But did anybody really dream as a child that they wanted to write about personal finance?
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.440]   Not me.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.000]   Like for me, I grew up watching pro wrestling.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   That's all I watched as a kid.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.360]   I didn't watch any sports.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.320]   I didn't I didn't follow any cartoons or anything.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.680]   I just watched wrestling.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.440]   So it was it was like a childhood dream.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.120]   So I told myself I need to do something about this.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.400]   I was twenty five years old.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.240]   I was one hundred seventy pounds.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.640]   I did everything I was supposed to do.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.360]   I went to school, graduated, blah, blah, blah, bought a condo.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.760]   I was doing what I was doing, I think I said I had to try this.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.480]   So just by some fluke, this is a sign from somebody.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.240]   A pro wrestling gym opens up five minutes away from me.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.740]   Wow.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.560]   I had to do it.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.840]   I'm not big enough.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.120]   I got everything going against me.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.920]   I had short hair.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.040]   It was not feasible.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.920]   It makes no sense.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.800]   Why would I do this?
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.320]   And I signed up and then I found out I was going to be on a show.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.480]   I'm like, I'm actually I have to be on a show.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.280]   I was just here having fun, you know, living out a dream, you know, being a being a villain.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.200]   And then it turns out that I actually made it onto the show.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.280]   So the first show I showed up like just regular gym shorts.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.680]   I just it was I was nervous.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.720]   I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.960]   I didn't even promote it and tell anybody about it.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.680]   It kind of happened.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.560]   Then I realized I love being a bad guy.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.160]   It's so much fun pissing people off.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.280]   So then over the years now, it's been two years.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.080]   I've just gone on like it's like I've made an event in shows.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.560]   I've just gone around and I'm having so much fun because this really is a childhood dream
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.760]   to be a villain.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.680]   Like I love writing about personal finance.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.840]   I love helping people, but I didn't grow up wanting to be a writer.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.520]   You know, I grew up wanting to be a wrestler.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.160]   So I'm just living the dream, having fun.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.440]   I mean, whether I make it or not, who knows who cares?
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.360]   I'm going to give it all that I have and just having fun.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.720]   In a business like that, from a business perspective, what's it like?
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.160]   Do you make money on the shows?
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.480]   Yeah, it's wrestling is you're a true entrepreneur.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.440]   You're a true freelancer because when you're an independent pro wrestler, you are your
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:53.840]   business.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.680]   So you are your brand.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.200]   So you have to get on shows.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.880]   You have to promote yourself.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.160]   Like right now, I'm wearing one of my own shirts, you know, self-promotion.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.000]   So you get paid based on your worth.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.600]   So let's say nobody knows you.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.320]   Nobody pays you.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.920]   It's like being a freelance writer.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.800]   You build your name up.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.240]   You work some shows for free.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.320]   I'm at the stage now where I'm getting paid a little bit, but now I have to build the
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:16.720]   brand.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.400]   I have to build up the persona.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.200]   So you make money through getting on shows.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.840]   You do seminars, you do T-shirt sales, and you truly are an independent contractor, an
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.480]   entrepreneur.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.000]   You have to get your name out there, travel, find a way to get on shows, record clips,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.880]   send clips to people because nobody knows you.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.760]   Nobody cares about you.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.560]   So you have to prove that you're worth being on a show.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.440]   So that's what I'm doing now.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.600]   I've made my videos, my highlight reels.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.040]   I'm sending them around.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.080]   I'm selling shirts.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.080]   And you just keep on doing that until you hit it.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.800]   You make it big.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.120]   How do the fights actually work?
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.440]   Are they choreographed move for move?
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.920]   That's a bit of a trade secret, but you can find the results online if you look that up.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.080]   You're not allowed to spill the secret.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.280]   I don't want to say publicly.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.480]   You'll find the results online.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.360]   A quick Google search will help you with that.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:09.680]   Okay.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.600]   It's an interesting perspective, some of those show business type of things.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.440]   I can't even imagine trying to make it as a primary career.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   But hey, as a secondary career, how cool that you can do something that's flexible enough
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.520]   to be able to do that.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.200]   And it gives you a purpose for your travel.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.440]   And it forces you to work out because you have to be like, right?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.160]   You're underwear.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.120]   You gotta look good in your underwear.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.800]   In front of people, in front of a lot of people.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.480]   And people are kind of rude, kind of mean, you know, especially when you're a bad guy.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.200]   Right.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.800]   But I mean, if you think about it, except seven, eight years ago, who would have thought
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.640]   you could be doing a personal finance podcast?
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.040]   You know, the world is just changing.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.320]   And now it's like weird when you meet someone that has a nine to five.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.520]   Right.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.040]   Well, especially if you go into different circles, that's what is amazing to me.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.560]   And the thing I love about creating digital content is in many ways, our lives often reflect
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.720]   the lives of those who are around us.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.720]   So when you come to a conference like this, everyone's got digital stuff going on.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's almost just normal.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.200]   And you see people creating their videos, making their podcasts, writing their articles.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.920]   It's people have very flexible lifestyles.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.360]   You go into a nine to five environment and it's nothing like that.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.720]   But it's all based upon your reference group, who you're with and what their lives are like.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:28.160]   And I find that it's remarkable how many people think that they need a blueprint.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.800]   Sometimes readers will come up to me and they want an exact plan on how to start freelancing
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.880]   and how to start doing this.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.480]   But a lot of life is on the job training.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.440]   I mean, you didn't think you could be a podcast host and maybe, you know, many years ago.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.000]   Now, here you are.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.080]   And who knows?
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.200]   Who knows what the future holds?
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.600]   Right?
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:47.840]   Right.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.960]   So this stage in looking at your career, you didn't need a college degree in order to be
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.760]   a freelance writer.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.080]   You don't need a college degree to be a professional wrestler.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.720]   Do you regret the money that you spent on college?
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.400]   No, no.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.360]   A lot of one thing that I hate is when people say that college is a waste of time, because
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.720]   I mean, I don't think it's a waste of time.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.400]   I think college is a great experience.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.360]   It's like it's a great thing to go through if you can avoid the debt.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.760]   The problem with college has become that it's like a debt, a debt sentence.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   Now, you know, it's like you get stuck with a student mortgage and you're and you're stuck
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.120]   with it for your life.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.040]   Like I meet people that are in their 40s, 50s, still paying off their student loans.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.680]   And I mean, that's not the way it should be.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.960]   I think that everybody should do their best to graduate debt free or with as little debt
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.320]   as possible, because life's too short to be in your 30s and stuck paying off debt.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.680]   Because then you're then of course, you're going to hate your college, because if you're
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.480]   stuck at a job that you don't want to be at only because you went to college to get a
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.680]   degree you don't want.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.720]   That's a vicious cycle.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.920]   And that's that's the cycle that you need to get out of or avoid at all costs.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.440]   But no, I don't regret college at all.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.280]   I recommend going to college.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.800]   I mean, it's not for everybody.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.160]   You don't have to go to college.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.240]   But you know, if you could manage your costs and you know what you want to study, then
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.740]   go for it.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:14.080]   Tell us about your websites, books, courses, anything you want people to be aware of, of
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.760]   yours that they can consume or buy from you.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.200]   So I launched a book this year called Next Rounds on Me.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.000]   Yeah, it's a I talk about financial freedom in your 20s without missing a party.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.600]   I take you from a broken, pissed off college student.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.680]   And I show you how to build wealth, how to buy real estate, how to pay off your credit
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.000]   card debt, how to build your credit score, because college doesn't really teach you these
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.240]   things.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.880]   You know, I noticed that many of my friends, they'll just tell me like, oh, I didn't learn
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.120]   that.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.600]   I'm like, I know nobody learned that.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.640]   Right.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.800]   It's nobody's job to teach you anything.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.760]   You have to go out there and pick up that experience and learn.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.240]   So that's why I wanted to put together a book that talks about like your credit score.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.040]   And then we talk about drinking, because if you tell a 20 something not to go out, they're
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.960]   just going to close your book.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.760]   Why would you read a book that tells you not to go out like this guy sucks.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:11.920]   So I talk about FOMO, the fear of missing out, which is huge right now because I get
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.040]   hit with FOMO the worst.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.760]   I was up to four in the morning last night because I didn't want to miss out.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:22.080]   So this is the only personal finance book that talks about FOMO, pre drinking, partying,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.760]   traveling and paying off your debt and building wealth.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.920]   And I recommend it to anybody in their 20s that's broke or pissed off or wants more money
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.600]   or is just sick of their current situation.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.360]   Pre drinking, that's the strategy where you drink your cheap booze at home before you
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.080]   go out to the bar.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.720]   Is that?
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   Pre drinking is an art in itself.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.480]   It's a...
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.680]   Tell us about pre drinking.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.840]   What are the secrets of success and pre drinking?
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.880]   You've never pre drank?
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.080]   No, I'm not a big drinker.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.840]   Ah, smart man, smart man.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.040]   Yes.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.600]   I'll have a glass or two of wine, but nothing more than one or two.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.240]   That's still considered a pre drink if you have it at home.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.520]   That's a good point.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.440]   So, but no, I'm not schooled in the arts of in the fine art of pre drinking.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.680]   Well, going out is the best part of your 20s, right?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.560]   That's how you meet people.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.520]   That's how you have fun.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.080]   That's what you do.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.280]   So the problem is it kind of sucks if you spend all your money on going out because then you're broke.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.440]   It's nuts how much you can spend in a night.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.120]   Some people are telling me it was eight dollars a drink last night by some people.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.080]   I mean me.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.760]   I went to buy someone a drink last night.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.640]   It was ten dollars.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.720]   So, you know, I'm not buying that person a drink again.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.240]   So, yeah, pre drinking is the art of having some drinks and having fun with your friends
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.920]   before you go out because once you get to the bar, it's loud, it's noisy.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.280]   You can't really hear anybody and it's so expensive and there's long lines
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.320]   and it's kind of watered down.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.600]   So pre drinking, you find a location and you I say you alternate places.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.640]   So you go to someone's house, a different person's house every time.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   Somebody's in charge of location.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.600]   Someone's in charge of the food and someone's in charge of the drinks.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.960]   Or someone could do all three or you can split it.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.680]   You get together.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.760]   I recommend karaoke.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.400]   Karaoke is the best way to pre drink because that sets the tone for the night.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.640]   OK.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.680]   Get some karaoke, do some corny love songs, have some drinks, order some pizza, laugh,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.480]   have a good time.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.000]   And then when it's time to go out, you go out and then you spend less money at the bar
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.440]   because you already drank and you already ate and you already took care of everything
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.200]   because why spend eight dollars a drink when you can spend eight dollars for a bottle?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.640]   But the trick is not to get too wasted.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.840]   So you have to really watch out with the pre drink.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.960]   Go to the point where you're feeling nice, but not too nice.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.360]   And then you go out and you save money.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.400]   What are the ethics and practice of taking a flask with you?
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.240]   Is this an acceptable personal finance?
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.560]   That's that's a touchy subject because if you can get it in, you can get it in.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:48.800]   Right.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   But if you get caught with the flask, I don't know.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.160]   I don't think they'll let you in.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.840]   So you have to check if there's a if they pat you at the door, you have to look into
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.160]   that.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.440]   That takes a bit of research.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   But hey, I'm all for that.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.040]   If you can bring in a flask, save even more money, then you won't even have to buy anything
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.440]   at the bar.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.120]   You have it on you at all times.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.680]   Sounds like you've done this maybe.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.280]   I've thought about it.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.040]   I'm not a like I said, not a big drinker.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.920]   And actually, you and I are probably polar opposites.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.040]   The worst thing that I could imagine doing with an evening of my time is going to a loud
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.840]   bar.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.960]   It's like I could see that it's just to me, I'm going to go home and go to bed.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.360]   But I'm you know, I'm not many people do enjoy it.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.600]   And I think the key is to recognize, hey, here's what's important to me.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.120]   Now, how can I get what's important to me without spending a ton of money and without
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.240]   just destroying my budget?
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.600]   And that's the thing.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:47.040]   That's why I talk about earning your freedom, because the world doesn't owe you anything.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.880]   You don't have to go out every weekend.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.240]   Nobody has to do anything for you.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.360]   You have to earn the right to party.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.040]   So this is why we build wealth.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.400]   We pay off debt so that you can do whatever it is you want to do.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.040]   Some people like to party, some like to buy new guitars.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.920]   My buddy doesn't go out ever, but he buys guitars.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.520]   He buys two thousand on guitars.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.400]   Who am I to judge?
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.600]   I'm out and he's he's buying new guitar and he loves it.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   So it's about buying the things that you love and cutting back on the things that you don't
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:13.840]   need.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.880]   You know, like you don't you don't need student loans.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.120]   Right.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.160]   Right.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.280]   And the thing about doing it that way, just doing it carefully, is the problem with student
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.880]   loans is once they get you, they got you and you can't get rid of them.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.360]   If you spend your money and you don't go into debt, well, you may go back to zero, but at
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.280]   least you can start building again.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.000]   And there aren't a bunch of tentacles trying to pull you down.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.960]   If you're in debt, the octopus has got its tentacles up, grabbing you and constantly
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.000]   pulling you down.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.560]   And it takes work to get your sword out and chop them all off so you can get up the ladder.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.160]   I compare debt to a hangover.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.680]   Your credit card bill is like a hangover.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.040]   You know, it's the bill.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:59.280]   It's the remainder of the good night's fun that spoils the next day.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.560]   It's the price you pay for last night or for what you did.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.160]   People tell me, oh, how do I cure a hangover?
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.520]   It's the same way you get out of debt.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.840]   You accept the fact that, A, you messed up.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.800]   Right, right.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.680]   So you say, how can I change this next time?
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.200]   Do I maybe not drink?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.560]   Do I drink more water?
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.440]   So what's your spending?
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.160]   Do you have to bring a credit card to the mall?
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:26.480]   Do you have to register your credit card with Amazon and every single online outlet?
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.680]   No, you don't.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.080]   And then you realize you got yourself here.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.760]   You got to get yourself out now.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.720]   One of my readers just paid off $45,000 worth of debt.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.440]   Awesome.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.080]   And honestly, she got herself into that debt.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.480]   I told her, the world's not out to get you.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.760]   You did this to yourself.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.640]   It's cool.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.320]   I mean, it's not cool, but it happened.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.820]   Right.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.480]   We have to accept it.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.080]   Figure out what it is that happened.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.680]   And now let's work on it.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.320]   Let's make a plan because nobody plans to be fat.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.760]   Nobody plans to be broke.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.440]   These are the things that happen to you when you don't plan.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.560]   So create a plan.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.480]   So I helped this young lady create a plan.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.520]   And she had to make some tough decisions in her life.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.760]   She had to work a little bit harder.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.440]   She had to cut a few subscriptions.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.640]   I told her, you can still have fun, but you're going to have to earn it because there's no
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.320]   need to be going out every day.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.040]   And there's also no need to be subscribing to all these different podcasts that charge
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.520]   you or different things.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.000]   And the toughest decision that she had to make in this case, like I mentioned earlier
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.720]   about the big sacrifice, she bought an engagement ring that she couldn't afford and she had
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.520]   to sell it.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.960]   She bought it for herself?
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.360]   Or why did she buy the engagement ring?
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.560]   Oh, she's a lesbian.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.240]   So she bought it for her partner.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:40.740]   Got it.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.200]   So that was the one tough decision.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.680]   So if you take anything away from this, I want you to make one tough decision that will
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.180]   help you.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.720]   In this case, that's the toughest decision.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.920]   Imagine taking a ring back.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   That's not accepted in society.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.800]   Once you give the ring out, everyone wants to talk about it, blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   But no, sometimes you have to make that tough decision.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.880]   It won't be popular.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.960]   Your friends won't like it.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.440]   Your partner certainly won't like it.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.800]   But you got to do what's best for you to help you get ahead.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.760]   Because once you get ahead and once you do what's best for you, then you can give back
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.880]   and help others.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.080]   But just like on an airplane, you got to put on your life jacket first before you can help
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.880]   anybody else.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.680]   Right.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.120]   Do you recommend people take cash with them when they're going out instead of their card?
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:27.760]   Things like that?
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.640]   Yeah, actually, I recommend doing experiments because I think personal finance is all about
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.280]   experiments.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.680]   On my site, I wrote about how I drove for Uber for a month.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.320]   And I also have done the cash experiment.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.120]   There's a positive and a negative with cash.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:47.200]   Because I say try for a week or two, track your spending.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.400]   Don't check your spending all the time.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.240]   But when you do an experiment, it's worth tracking and see what works better for you.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   Because with a credit card, you can at least at the end of the week or with a debit card
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.560]   at the end of the week, you can see where you spent your money.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.080]   You'll be like, oh, no, two in the morning, McDonald's, what was I doing?
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.920]   And in this case, I just wasn't thinking so much about tracking, but about control.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.320]   I mean, there's been many times I've been out with my buddies and all of a sudden, it's 1230
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.640]   in the morning and they're ready to pick up the bar tab for everyone around and just slap down
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.280]   the Amex.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.720]   That's not so good the next day.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.720]   But if you got five $20 bills and that's your limit for the night, then you're able to say,
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.160]   well, sorry, I got five $20 bills here and they got to get me all night.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.240]   Well, sounds like you guys didn't pre-drink, first of all.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.440]   Well, yeah, going out is different.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.080]   When it comes to going out, actually, my advice is very strict.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:44.000]   It's bring your ID, bring $20 for a cap, you better not drink and drive or else we're going
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.640]   to have trouble.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:44.880]   Right.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.440]   There's a $20,000 decision right there.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.320]   Exactly.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.160]   Bring your debit, bring your ID, no credit cards at all and bring the cash you plan on spending.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.840]   Once you run out, you run out.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.240]   Right.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.720]   Because once you have a few drinks, like you said, you're going to pick up the tab for
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.600]   everybody.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.880]   I got a friend, if you even look in his direction, he'll buy you a drink.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.400]   I don't even want to think about his credit card bill.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.120]   So in that case, no, don't bring your credit card to the bar.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.080]   But when it comes to everyday spending, I would do it for two weeks and see where your
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.560]   money goes.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.720]   Because the good thing about a credit card and a debit card is you'll see what you did
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.840]   right and what you did wrong.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.920]   For me, my biggest problem area is food.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.080]   I tracked it once, I spent $565 a month on food.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.560]   I love eating out.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.840]   That's what I do for fun.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.120]   I go out with friends for food.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.040]   And I mean, I tried using cash, but still a lot of money, at least with a credit card,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.320]   I saw where the money was going.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:48.720]   But with cash, for me personally, cash works best when it comes to the big purchases, because
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.360]   I have a tough time handing over cash.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.000]   When it comes to swiping, especially Amazon, Amazon is the biggest culprit here.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Those guys will save all your information.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.120]   They literally make it so easy to spend money, you feel stupid if you don't buy something.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.560]   I checked out my own book and keep on recommending me to buy my own book.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.520]   I almost bought it again.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.920]   Don't wait a minute, this is my book.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.280]   Those guys will send you emails like, do you look at something?
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.320]   You'll get an email the next day.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.920]   Hey, you looked at this, what happened?
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.960]   And if you save your credit card with those guys, oh my, they will make that you go on
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.400]   there, the one click purchase.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.360]   Then you're like, wait a minute, you might like this.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.960]   And I go, yeah, I do like that.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.480]   Next thing you know, you're down $100.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.120]   What did I do?
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.480]   So studenomics.com or studenomics.com, what's the name of the book?
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.440]   Next Round's on Me.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.480]   Next Round's on Me.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.040]   It's available on Amazon, CreateSpace.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.320]   Oh no, that's where I published it, sorry.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.120]   It's available on Amazon and Kindle.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.160]   The Kindle's cheaper.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:46.480]   Awesome.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.840]   Martin, thanks so much for coming on, man.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.560]   Thanks for your time.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:54.560]   It's kind of interesting in the college years, there's a lot of concern, or at least I was
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.120]   pretty concerned about my level of coolness.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.080]   But you know what's cool?
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.280]   Not being a financial train wreck.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.160]   You know what's cooler?
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.040]   Not being broke.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.880]   You know what's even cooler?
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.400]   Being financially independent.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.880]   So take this show, share it with somebody, and I hope that they can use the information
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.640]   and the ideas to have a little fun and also really set up a serious plan for their finances.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.000]   Because if you have a plan behind you, it frees you up.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.960]   Frees you up to do things like pursue a professional wrestling career.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.400]   Or frees you up to pursue things like you fill in the blank with the things that you
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:28.900]   want to do.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.880]   Really can make a difference.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.320]   So that's it for today's show.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.160]   Happy Thanksgiving to those of you who are in the United States and celebrate Thanksgiving.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.000]   I am away.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.240]   This show was pre-recorded and released pre-recorded.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.280]   I'm away with my family.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.000]   I appreciate each and every one of you who's listening.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.040]   I hope that you are enjoying your time with your family.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.440]   The show will be back on Monday, November 30th.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.640]   No show on Thursday.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   No show on Friday.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.360]   Hey, do yourself a favor.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.320]   Sleep in on Friday.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.560]   Don't get caught up in this mania of that.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.240]   I mean, hey, if you need a deal and you can find a deal on Black Friday, I'm all for deals.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.200]   But save yourself some money and just live a simpler life.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.040]   My tip for you.

[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.920]   a couple hundred bucks a month.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.640]   Take the value that you think I deliver to you.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.720]   Take 10% of that and send 10% of that to me.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.600]   That's what I ask.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.480]   And then if I ever don't deliver the value, just cancel.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.040]   No big deal.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.960]   That keeps me on my toes, keeps me accountable to y'all, keeps me working hard.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.920]   Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.240]   We will talk with you next week.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:06.560]   [music]
