[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.440]   - In the last podcast, we talked about making
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.840]   truth discoveries for ourselves, owning truth,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.400]   affectionately clinging to biblical realities,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.120]   and not just reading about it from others.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.320]   And I'm curious, Pastor John, as you read and study
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.180]   the Bible for yourself in your own devotional times,
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.480]   is there for you a space between the initial discovery
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.040]   of a truth and your affectionate embrace of it?
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.000]   Is there a process between seeing a new truth
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.660]   and owning that truth for yourself?
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.100]   Or is this something that really just happens
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.360]   immediately for you?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.200]   - Well, the answer is yes, yes.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.440]   Absolutely, it can be immediate.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.280]   In fact, it usually is immediate.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   And the reason for stepping back from an immediate experience
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.720]   of something either terrifying or sweet and precious,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.920]   a whole range of emotions may happen immediately
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.120]   when you see something for the first time
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.060]   that you have never seen before.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.980]   I think the reason you may have to step back from that
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.980]   is you might not have it quite right.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.860]   There might be an aspect of it that you're seeing accurately
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.940]   and an aspect of it that you're seeing inaccurately.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.100]   And so some of your emotions might be spiritually
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.420]   appropriate to the aspect that you see truly.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.300]   And some of your emotions might be mistaken
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.060]   by responding to something you're misapprehending
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.940]   and to discern whether that's the case or not,
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.840]   there will be a season, it may not be that day,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860]   it might be a week later, or it might be five minutes later
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.860]   where you get out your dictionary and look that word up
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.820]   and you see, oh, it didn't mean what I thought it meant
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820]   and all my emotions were based on an error.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.380]   Or you may find that the error in this text
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.560]   was true in another text so that the emotions were real,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.700]   they were just based on another aspect
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.140]   or another place in the Bible
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.700]   rather than this place in the Bible.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700]   I think that's very helpful to get the intellectual support
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.100]   underneath the emotional experience
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.340]   so that it's confident now.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.340]   And when you speak of it to others or commend it to others,
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.820]   you can commend both the experience that you had
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.220]   and you can commend the intellectual warrant for it
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.860]   that you've checked out.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.420]   You know, this is simply,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.960]   I've got Lewis coming out of my pores right now
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   and Lewis is so big on the distinction
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.620]   between two kinds of knowing,
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.060]   the knowing of the intensity, say,
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.060]   of sexual intercourse with your wife
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.940]   and the thinking about that experience
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.420]   and how to maybe bless her more in it.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.100]   You can't do both of those at the same time
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.380]   because when you're in an experience of exquisite joy
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.060]   or let's just say fear,
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.140]   maybe you just saw a bear on the front porch of your cabin
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.860]   and your door's not locked.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.180]   And right at that moment,
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.180]   you're not analyzing the nature of fear.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.500]   You're just fully experiencing fear.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   Later, you can look at it
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.840]   and Lewis is just supremely gifted at both of those
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.420]   and all of us should be, I think,
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.520]   more or less given to both of those.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   Let fitting emotions rise and glut yourself
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.380]   on the glory of God in any discovery you make in the Bible.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.300]   Then later in the peace and the coolness
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.660]   of your reflective moments,
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.660]   study it out and make sure you saw what you really saw.
