[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   But first, let's focus on schools.
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.580]   Lots of various school districts are voting
[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.500]   on their reopening plans this week,
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.940]   and they may be reading about a few cases from abroad
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.940]   that may raise concerns here,
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.580]   at least give them something to think about.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.560]   So joining us is mask expert
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.260]   and University of San Francisco data scientist,
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.100]   Jeremy Howard.
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.740]   Good to see you again, Jeremy.
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.580]   - Hi there.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.080]   - All right, let's start with the headlines
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.300]   from internationally.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.620]   I know you're watching stories
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.140]   out of several different countries.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.940]   Take us through some of the examples
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.260]   and what they mean for us here.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.100]   - Sure.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.620]   The question about the impact of schools
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.820]   on COVID-19 transmission is super complicated.
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.380]   We don't really know what's going on.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.220]   Here's the problem.
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.180]   The problem is that normally we figure out
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.960]   what's happening with transmission using contact tracing,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.300]   which is where we say to people,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.520]   "Hey, who did you talk to?"
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   And then we go and, you know, "Who did you hang out with?"
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.860]   And we go and see if they have COVID-19.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.240]   Problem is, kids almost never get significant enough
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.220]   symptoms that they end up as a recorded case.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.020]   So there's a huge amount of unrecorded transmission in kids.
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.360]   And we can see that, for example, in Sweden.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.060]   In Sweden, they did not close down the school system.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.580]   And then they did what's called a seroprevalence survey,
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.940]   which is where they went around to lots
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.540]   and lots of people at random and tested them.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740]   And it turned out kids had about as much COVID-19
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.940]   as adults did.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.460]   So it turned out the transmission was just as bad.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.540]   We have no reason to believe that those kids
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.660]   can't then go on to pass it on to their teachers
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.140]   and their parents and their grandparents
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.620]   just as easily as adults.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.660]   So what we've now seen is, for example, in Israel,
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.580]   they had nearly wiped out the virus.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.260]   They were down to 10 cases.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.860]   They opened up schools,
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.620]   and then suddenly it's gone out of control.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.380]   They're now growing, it looks like, faster than the U.S.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.020]   - I think yesterday they recorded a thousand cases
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420]   in 24 hours, right?
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.940]   So they ordered strict lockdowns again.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.860]   But what happened and what did it have to do with schools?
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740]   - Yeah, so what happened was Israel
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.940]   did a lot of things right.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.420]   They had mandatory masks from early on.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.940]   They did a lockdown of schools and other things.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.380]   And then they kind of gradually brought schools back
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.700]   in a very safe way, small classes
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.220]   that didn't interact at all.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.460]   They did it for two weeks.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.820]   And then against the guidance of the health experts,
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.100]   the government said, "All right, everything's open."
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.900]   And it just was bang, everything opened up.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.580]   And then suddenly within a month, massive outbreaks,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.860]   we've seen the same thing in my hometown of Melbourne
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.220]   in Australia, nearly eliminated the virus.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.420]   Schools opened and now the biggest outbreak
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.540]   in the whole country in a school over,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.100]   I think it's about 150 people.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.740]   It's a real worry what we're seeing in the recent weeks
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.900]   is it seems like schools can be a real transmission source.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.340]   - Well, are they looking at what is going on
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.180]   in those schools?
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.300]   I mean, are the kids wearing their masks
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.220]   or are they defying orders?
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820]   Are they not able to socially distance?
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.420]   Have they kind of done a deep dive into what happened?
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.340]   - No time for a deep dive yet.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.700]   What we do know, for example,
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.660]   is in the Melbourne, Australia case,
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.620]   the school focused a lot on kind of sanitation,
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.100]   hand hygiene, cleaning of classrooms.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.900]   They didn't have masks.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.420]   Reporting that social distancing was poor.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.100]   Reporting in Israel that masks were not being widely used
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.260]   in schools.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.820]   So it seems like this respiratory virus, you know,
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.340]   is in a great situation to transfer through breathing,
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.180]   through speaking, maybe even coughing
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.580]   in this indoor environment
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.900]   where there's lots of talking going on.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.420]   - Now each school district, as you know,
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.460]   here in California gets to make its own decision.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.180]   What do you make of Orange County's Board of Education
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.900]   last night voting on their reopening plan
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.460]   that does not actually mandate kids wear a mask
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.620]   while on campus?
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.020]   If they were to consult you, what would you say?
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.620]   - I would say this is a real worry.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.900]   Look, kids can wear masks.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.580]   My four-year-old daughter refuses not to wear a mask.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.660]   She sees all the adults around her wearing a mask.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.340]   She sees all her friends wearing a mask.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.580]   She has a fun, cool mask.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.220]   Kids can wear masks, it's fine.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.460]   And at school, it's really hard to have them distancing
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.840]   all the time, you know, kids will be kids.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.420]   So we know that when you wear a mask,
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.260]   it means that that droplet cloud,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.620]   that germ cloud is smaller and distancing works better.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.700]   So it's gonna make our schools much more likely
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.020]   to be able to open faster and better and more safely
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.540]   if the children are wearing masks.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.260]   - But what do you make of the argument
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.140]   that we've heard from some that with really young kids,
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.200]   they could wear it in an unsafe way,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.580]   leading to more touching and more transmission,
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.620]   and then separately, the social, emotional issues, right?
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.160]   Not being able to read cues
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.960]   when they can't see all the facial expressions
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.620]   due to mask wearing.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.860]   And maybe they would get frightened.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.020]   What do you make of those arguments?
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.820]   - So the first one, I think it's nonsense.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.500]   We've heard it for adults as well.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.220]   We're told that people are not capable of wearing a mask.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.420]   We're capable of wearing all these other pieces of clothing.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.200]   You know, we can wear socks, we can wear underpants,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.180]   we can wear masks.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.620]   And even if we do it wrong,
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.500]   at least there's something covering our face.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.460]   Even if we touch it,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.420]   it's a lot better than touching our face with no mask.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.960]   As for the learning, yeah, I mean,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.700]   I don't know what to say. It really is a compromise.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.580]   It really is tough.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.520]   I don't know what the right answer is with schools.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.240]   But here's the thing.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.500]   We do know that if we have big outbreaks in schools,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.020]   they're gonna close down and there's gonna be no learning.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.700]   And there's gonna be no childcare,
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.540]   and there's gonna be no jobs for the teachers.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.140]   So in the end, I think we do have to think about
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.980]   what compromises we're willing to make
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.660]   to give our kids a chance to learn.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.260]   - I think a lot of people have also questioned
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260]   the efficacy of masks, right?
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.800]   I read a headline today.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.820]   I think the director for the Center for AIDS Research
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.980]   at UCSF today said, "Even if you become infected,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.580]   "masking can still protect you from more severe disease."
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.520]   Can you explain that one?
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.540]   So what we've seen in the populations that are wearing masks,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.060]   which is the vast majority of the world, it's required now,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.700]   over 80% of the population and over 70% of the U.S. population
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.340]   has to wear masks legally in public spaces.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.380]   And what we see is not only do the number of cases drop,
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.260]   but it seems the number of deaths drops
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260]   even faster and even more.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.140]   And we think that the reason for that
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.320]   is that the viral dose is decreased.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.060]   Less of those virions get through the mask
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.820]   and therefore less of them infect you.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.740]   And when you have a lower viral dose,
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.700]   a lot of virologists believe that that actually results
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   in less severe symptoms and therefore less fatalities
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.620]   and less significant transmission.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.780]   So wearing a mask is probably a good idea
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.940]   from both directions.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.780]   - Got it.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.620]   Yeah, because you always hear,
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.300]   "Oh, you're wearing it to protect the other person, right?
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.180]   To protect others."
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.100]   But this is suggesting that it could have some effect
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.580]   in protecting you as well.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.700]   - Yeah, but it depends a lot on what you're using.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.540]   You know, there is an increasing availability
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.980]   of kind of surgical masks and better quality masks.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.780]   And these do provide a better protection to the wearer.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.860]   - All right, well, I do wanna ask you,
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.140]   there's something cultural about wearing masks here,
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.820]   but President Trump recently wore one in public
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.080]   for the very first time while visiting Walter Reed.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.300]   And today CDC director, Dr. Robert Redfield said
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.060]   the key to opening schools is masks,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.580]   saying the data is really clear, they work.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.100]   So do you think attitudes have changed
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.140]   and significantly in just the last couple of weeks?
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.200]   - Very significantly.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.660]   Unfortunately, the thing that's made it change
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.380]   is the big outbreaks in states like Texas and Florida.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.060]   It's kind of brought it home that this is a real virus.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.860]   It's causing real risks and real deaths.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.180]   And so this awareness that everybody
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.540]   can be hit by this virus,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.640]   every place can be hit by this virus.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.000]   So for example, in Texas, Governor Abbott
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.420]   is now requiring masks everywhere
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.260]   where there's a significant number of cases,
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.860]   more than like 20.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.300]   And yeah, Donald Trump, you know,
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.860]   when there was an outbreak in the White House,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.540]   he required everybody in the White House to wear them.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.300]   And he's now, thank God, being a role model himself
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.760]   and being seen wearing a mask.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.820]   And I think that's gonna make a huge difference.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.780]   - All right, and as people start to wear masks more,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.300]   and actually still debate whether or not they should,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.700]   there have been lots of confrontations on the streets
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.980]   among strangers, right?
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.080]   Over people saying, hey, wear yours.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   No, I don't wanna wear mine.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.220]   Or people saying, you should be wearing one.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.820]   And people saying, I don't need to wear one right now.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.860]   I'm not near people.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.040]   Can you tell us the scenarios when masks are needed
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.360]   so that people know,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.980]   so they don't need to confront each other?
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.940]   - Yeah, I mean, look, I don't confront people about masks.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.660]   You know, we've got better things to do.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.340]   It's more likely to cause danger
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.060]   than doing nothing, I think, right?
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.580]   So I'd like to start off by saying, don't be the police.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.700]   Also, if you see somebody with like not over their nose,
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.700]   don't worry too much.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.500]   That doesn't really reduce the effectiveness
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.440]   for protecting you anyway.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.160]   But given all that, you know, where do you need a mask?
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.300]   You need them indoors when you're around people
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.420]   that you don't see all the time.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.300]   So not your family or roommates or whatever.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.740]   And particularly if you're closer than six feet.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.640]   Even outdoors, if it's like, if there's no wind,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.780]   if you're gonna be close to somebody
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.260]   for more than about 15 minutes,
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.580]   I would say that's a risky situation too.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.980]   Now, of course, in the Bay Area,
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.540]   we have to wear them outside anyway.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.900]   I think 30 feet is the limit.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.260]   For me, I think that's kind of overkill.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.300]   From a practical point of view, you know,
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.100]   I would say I'd really focus on those indoor public spaces,
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.540]   public transport, shops, stuff like that.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.220]   - I know 30 feet is San Francisco.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.380]   Not sure about the other counties,
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.620]   but what if you're just walking out there
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.960]   in the neighborhoods on wide streets
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.560]   and you know to avoid each other,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.200]   kind of get over to the other side of the street
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.160]   when you see someone coming
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.800]   and you're just kind of jogging by yourself.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.140]   Do you need to wear a mask for that?
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.700]   - Not really, I would say don't worry about it.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.260]   Look, some people are more cautious than others
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.680]   and they might want to put a mask on in that situation,
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.420]   but I don't really think that's important.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.020]   The transmission rates outdoors 20 times lower than indoors
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.460]   and transmission occurs when you're close to somebody
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.380]   for a period of time and there's a chance
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.020]   for that germ cloud to form.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.820]   That's not gonna happen when you walk past somebody
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.620]   unless they like sneeze at you or something,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.820]   which that would be bad.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.260]   So maybe that's the one reason.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.420]   - Well, this is not coming at you,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.080]   but a viewer wants to know what if you're walking
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.820]   behind somebody who is not wearing a mask?
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.300]   - Yeah, it's possible.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.620]   It's pretty speculative.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.820]   I haven't seen examples, documented cases
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.140]   where that's led to transmission.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.340]   Doesn't mean it's not possible.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.920]   I would certainly be a little more cautious myself
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.980]   in that situation.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.340]   I try not to walk straight behind people across the road
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.500]   or pass them or leave a bit of a gap.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.700]   - All right, Jeremy Howard, always great talking to you.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.680]   Thank you so much for that information.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.780]   Take good care and we'll see you again soon.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.300]   - My pleasure.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.640]   - All right, folks, when we come back,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.060]   we'll talk with Marin County's health officer
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.580]   about the impact of Governor Newsom's new order
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.500]   to close businesses back down.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.340]   Be right back.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.700]   All right, folks, it's a Tuesday
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.660]   and already a whirlwind week.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.860]   As you know, Governor Newsom orders sweeping restrictions
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.980]   once again for most counties in California.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.740]   And so we're talking about it because one way or another,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.420]   it is affecting you most likely.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.660]   And a pleasure to have Jeremy Howard on
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.780]   because he has done a lot of studies on masks,
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.260]   the efficacy of masks,
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.400]   and he's been a proponent of masks for all since March.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.040]   And it's not really being heated
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.100]   by a majority of the population until more recently.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.460]   And sadly, as you heard, the COVID numbers are going up.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.060]   And so more people are wearing the masks
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.680]   and it is not hopefully too late.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.380]   If we all try to be as safe as possible,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.940]   hopefully that allows schools to reopen safely
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.180]   and keep the community transmission numbers down
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.380]   and the local numbers down.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.020]   Hey folks, some of our regulars, nice to see you.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.220]   Nice to see you.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.900]   Lots of opinions about whether people should,
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.460]   kids should go back to school.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.660]   Some people are advocating for distance learning.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.860]   Other people saying you will not send your kids to school.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.820]   Other people saying, what about the mental health aspect
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.020]   and you want your kids in school?
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.620]   Of course, they are all valid concerns.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.740]   That is the thing.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.960]   There's not a single right or wrong answer.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.820]   It's kind of this constant juggling
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.540]   of ever-changing factors,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.140]   ever-changing situations and numbers.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.940]   And no matter which way you cut it,
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.280]   there are drawbacks and there are pluses and minuses
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.060]   no matter which decision you take and which path you take.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.660]   Same with all these school districts.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.660]   So, okay, well then that's our plan.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:59.060]   Folks, while we wait for Marin County's Health Officer
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.340]   and Eric, how do we say the officer's name?
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.100]   Lane Hendricks?
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.060]   Okay, they'll be joining shortly.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.660]   In the meantime, we'll continue to talk with Jeremy.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:22.620]   All right, we are back with Jeremy Howard
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.100]   of Masks for All and a USF data scientist
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.340]   talking about the importance of masking.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.300]   I'd like to ask you if you have any more data
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.940]   with regard to the efficacy.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.380]   And I think for the people who are mostly in the Bay Area
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.040]   are pretty convinced about wearing masks,
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.260]   but in case they're sitting there, not sure,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.580]   any other data that's new to offer.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.580]   Yeah, plenty.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.780]   In fact, just this morning, I gave a presentation
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.140]   to the World Health Organization on this,
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.540]   so I am full of data, I can talk for hours.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.080]   Great, good timing.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.780]   Yeah, some of the most interesting data
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.340]   is what they call ecological data,
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.340]   which is looking around the world at saying,
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.820]   let's look at the places that have put in mask requirements,
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.580]   what happened before, what happened afterwards.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.420]   Goldman Sachs actually did a really great study of that.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.940]   They estimated that if the rest of the country
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.260]   introduced mask mandates, it would add a trillion dollars
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.100]   to the US GDP.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.820]   Another of these, similar studies has estimated
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.980]   that already we've saved 300 to 400,000 cases
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.940]   even before the end of May
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   through these mandates in the US.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.200]   So in the US, one of the things we've really seen
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.480]   in the data is that Americans generally
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.220]   are not wearing masks until we tell them you have to.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.780]   And then once we say you have to, they are.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.540]   And this is not surprising 'cause the messaging
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.900]   was all over the place for a long time.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.180]   And so this is why we now see over 70% of Americans
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.740]   live in places where they actually have to wear a mask.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.100]   Okay, Jeremy, you also put out something
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.160]   that I thought was very interesting today,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.560]   which is cleaning solution ingredients
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.920]   that work against coronaviruses.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.200]   I know a lot of people are interested in this,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.420]   so tell us what are those ingredients
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.100]   and what should we have in the house?
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.620]   I do not remember off the top of my head.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.460]   Hopefully you can dig it up and maybe pop it on the screen.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.160]   I will run through this with you.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.000]   Let's see.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.020]   I'll tell you what though, what I wrote there
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.820]   was like what I got from the Singaporean health body
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.420]   is the underlying chemicals.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.660]   So that way you don't have to look at every brand.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.500]   Thank goodness.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.680]   I can't say the names of those chemicals anyway.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.020]   But look on the bottle, right?
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.500]   So if you can put it on the screen or say them,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.820]   look on the bottle for these particular chemicals
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.460]   because they basically all have the same thing.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.300]   And when I looked around our house,
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.500]   we had like somehow we had six different bottles
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.840]   of cleaning fluid and five of them had these chemicals
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.980]   which were effective against coronaviruses.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.360]   Yeah, but generally what are those products?
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Accelerated hydrogen peroxide, benzylcholineum chloride,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.620]   coral, silanol. Yeah, so that's like bleach.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.460]   Yeah, yeah, it's just like, you know,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.020]   they're just the chemical names for bleach
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.860]   and stuff like that.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.420]   So they're really normal standard kind of things.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.740]   The other thing I wanted to mention
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.980]   which I've looked at recently is the research around masks
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.300]   for protecting the wearer, not just for protecting others.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.340]   And there's actually a whole lot of interesting stuff
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.900]   going on there.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.060]   You can now buy, you know,
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.060]   pieces of kind of special filter paper
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.900]   which are actually designed to protect the wearer.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.140]   One I really like, I don't get paid for any of this,
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.180]   it's just stuff I've seen that I've bought
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.620]   is called Filtee, F-I-L-T-I,
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.740]   which is originally this company
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.200]   made like air conditioning filters
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.960]   and then they switched to mask filters
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.020]   and they've actually been tested
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.260]   on the same equipment they use for medical masks
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260]   and it's actually getting the same level of filtration.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.580]   And so if you now go to like Etsy,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.860]   you can buy from hundreds of different
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.140]   kind of community DIY crafters,
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.380]   masks with these Filtee pockets
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.320]   which are gonna do a fantastic job of protecting you
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.660]   as well as the people around you.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.300]   - Oh, I do see a lot of that, Filtee fabric.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.120]   All right, thank you so much.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.540]   You always have interesting advice for us
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.640]   and we appreciate it.
