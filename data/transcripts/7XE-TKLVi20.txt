[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.400]   Welcome, everyone, to the 66th episode of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.000]   Today, we're going to be talking about real estate investing with two special guests,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.400]   Jim Dawley, who created an in-depth course on real estate investing, and
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.400]   John Worth, who's a chief economist at NARIT, formerly known as
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:43.200]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.920]   Hi, everyone, my name is Rick Ferry, and I am the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.480]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.720]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.720]   A nonprofit organization that is building a world of well-informed, capable, and
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.240]   empowered investors.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.680]   Visit the Bogle Center at boglecenter.net, where you will find
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.440]   a treasure trove of information, including transcripts of these podcasts.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.040]   Before we get started today, I have a special announcement.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.280]   On behalf of all Bogleheads worldwide, we wish Taylor Larimore a happy birthday.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.800]   Taylor is 100 years old this month.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.480]   He is the founder of the Bogleheads.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.000]   Jack Bogle called him the king of the Bogleheads.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.120]   Back in 1998, he founded the organization by putting the very first post
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.520]   on the Morningstar Forum, at the time called Vanguard Diehards.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.120]   It has since moved on to its own website, bogleheads.org.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.080]   He is also the author and co-author of three Bogleheads books, and
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.160]   was instrumental in creating the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.680]   Taylor was a graduate of the University of Miami School of Business.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.680]   He served as a paratrooper in World War II in the 101st Airborne Division
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.760]   during the Battle of the Bulge, earning five combat decorations.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.080]   He's an avid sailing enthusiast, and
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.440]   was named the American Sailing Association's Instructor of the Year.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.000]   Taylor now continues to spend his time sailing and
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.560]   helping others discover the Bogleheads way.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.880]   If you'd like to wish Taylor a happy birthday,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   there will be a special post on bogleheads.org for
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.120]   you to add your birthday wishes and special thanks.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.360]   Today our conversation is about real estate, and it is primarily directed at
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.920]   people who are interested in adding real estate as an asset class, or
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.320]   expanding their real estate holdings into different parts of the real estate market.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.480]   Our first guest is Dr. Jim Dolly.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240]   Jim is an avid Boglehead.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960]   He is a practicing emergency room physician and
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.640]   founder of the White Coat Investor.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.960]   Jim has developed many courses helping individual investors and professionals.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.720]   And one of the courses that he recently developed is a no frills
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.600]   real estate investing course, where he covers all aspects of real estate investing,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.880]   along with the faculty of more than a dozen highly qualified instructors.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.120]   So we're gonna be talking about that with Jim.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.760]   And our second guest is Dr. John Wirth.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.960]   John is the Executive Vice President, Research and
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.720]   Investor Outreach at NARED,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.640]   formerly known as the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.120]   He was a former chief economist at the National Credit Union Administration.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.440]   And prior to that, he spent nearly a decade at US Treasury,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.240]   where he served as the Director of the Office of Microeconomic Analysis.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.480]   And he was there during the entire financial crisis.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.240]   So with no further ado, let me welcome back Dr. Jim Dolly.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.040]   Welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing, Jim.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.760]   >> Thank you, it's always a pleasure to be here, and
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.840]   a pleasure to be with Bogleheads, especially in person at the conference.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.560]   >> Yeah, we had a great conference, and thank you and your wife so
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.040]   much for helping out.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.680]   Today, our topic is real estate.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.120]   I came to you because of two reasons.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.160]   You've always talked about real estate, and you talk about it in your books.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.040]   But recently, you put together a course on real estate that you call
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.480]   the No Hype Real Estate Investing course.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.280]   First, why do you say no hype?
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.800]   And secondly, why do you think you needed to put together a course like this?
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.400]   And thirdly, what kind of real estate investing do you do?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.040]   >> One of the biggest things I don't like about real estate is it's full of hype.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.000]   You pick up a real estate book, and there's all kinds of hype in it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.360]   You take a course, there's hype in it.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.600]   You go to a website, there's hype in it.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.320]   I don't like it.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   It turns me off.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.440]   I feel like I'm being sold to.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.520]   And I know a lot of Bogleheads don't like that either.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.560]   And so I kind of took the approach of, if we're gonna make a course,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.160]   let's have it be just the facts, ma'am.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.520]   And I think people respond well to that.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.240]   >> And you pulled together a lot of professionals,
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.400]   a lot of people in the industry.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.320]   It isn't just you that's speaking in this course.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.160]   >> Absolutely correct.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.640]   There's a whole bunch of other people that have recorded material for the course.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.680]   And I don't pretend to be an expert in every single part of real estate.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.080]   I haven't done every type of real estate investing.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.680]   And so that's one of the benefits of having other faculty members in the course,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.720]   is you can hear about flipping homes, for instance,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.080]   from someone who's actually flipped homes,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.520]   rather than me, who only knows about it theoretically.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.560]   >> Tell us a little bit about yourself and
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.480]   your own experiences with real estate investing.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.320]   >> Sure, I have a little bit of experience with direct real estate investing,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   kind of an accidental landlord situation.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   And realized fairly early on that I prefer to be mostly on the passive
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.040]   side of the spectrum.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   I think it was Michael LaBouf who talks about investing your time actively and
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.680]   your money passively.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.600]   And Bogleheads obviously try to do that for the most part.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.400]   And I've been a Boglehead for a long time.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.040]   And so I try to invest pretty passively for the most part.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.080]   And so I end up on the passive side of the spectrum.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.080]   What does that mean?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.920]   That means publicly traded REITs, and
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.800]   the holding I use there is just a real estate index fund.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   It means syndications,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.160]   essentially going in with 99 other people and buying an apartment complex.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.840]   But for the most part, my main other holding outside of publicly traded REITs
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.840]   are private real estate funds.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.160]   These are investments that are only available to accredited investors, but
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.840]   allow you to have some diversification.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   So instead of getting one apartment building,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   you get 15 apartment buildings in the fund, for example.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.880]   And that allows you to be diversified if one of those goes bad.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.520]   On the debt side, these tend to be loans to developers.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.360]   Typical fund might have 75 or 300 different loans to developers.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.800]   And they pay pretty good interest in order to have access to money
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.680]   without having to go to a bank.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.640]   And so they might borrow money at 10 or 12% plus two points.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.440]   And even after paying the fees in the fund,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   you may come out with 8, 9, 10, 12% return on that money.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.560]   So I invest in both private equity and private debt funds.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.080]   Those are my main holdings outside of publicly traded REITs.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.040]   If I didn't know anything about real estate, which I don't really know that
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.520]   much, I've only owned residential real estate plus real estate investment for
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.880]   us, index fund.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.280]   If I was going to learn, you have a really good blog on your website called
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.600]   Real Estate Investing 101.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.680]   And it does give you an awful lot of information.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.200]   When you first go into the blog and you start reading about it,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.040]   you have this nice graph which talks about the four quadrants of real estate
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.560]   investing.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.360]   I wonder if you could touch on that.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.960]   It's pretty easy, I think, to talk about real estate to somebody who
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.560]   invests kind of traditional investments.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   You know, if you understand stocks and bonds,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.600]   it's not that hard to understand real estate.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   You can invest on the equity side, the equivalent of a stock investor.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   Or you can invest on the debt side, the equivalent of a bond investor.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.280]   So if you're investing on the equity side, the simplest form of real estate
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.600]   might be buying the house next door and renting it out to somebody.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.960]   Your income for this equity investment is the rent.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.760]   Now, it's not the only source of return.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.000]   The house might appreciate in value as well.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.880]   Maybe you get some tax breaks for it.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.480]   And you can depreciate the house.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.320]   And that gives you a substantial tax break.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.160]   But for the most part, your income coming in is the rent.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.600]   And your expenses for this business you now own
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.920]   are things like a mortgage, property insurance, property taxes, maintenance,
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.080]   all those sorts of things that it takes to run the business.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.640]   So that's being an equity investor.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   When it goes up in value, you get the benefit of that.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.000]   When you're able to raise rent on it or you're
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.080]   able to charge other fees to the renter, your income goes up on it.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.960]   You benefit from all of that as the equity investor,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.800]   the owner of the property.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.160]   But there's another way to invest in real estate.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.320]   And that's being the debt investor.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.360]   Most people have investments in real estate that are leveraged,
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.440]   meaning they borrowed at least some of the money to invest in it.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.560]   And you can invest on that debt side as well.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.200]   You can loan money to somebody who is the equity investor in real estate.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.400]   And just as bonds are less risky than stocks,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.960]   investing on the debt side is less risky than being an owner.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.600]   In the event that something terrible happens with the business,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.720]   the debt side typically comes out with all or most of their capital.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.600]   And when something terrible is going on and you're on the equity side,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.940]   you might lose all of your capital, especially if it's highly leveraged.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.560]   And so there's two ways to invest there.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.120]   There's the equity and the debt.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.000]   On the debt side, you split out two types of debt.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   There's called hard money loan.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.120]   And then there's mezzanine debt or preferred equity.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.480]   Can you describe the difference between the two?
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.960]   This is what gets a lot of people a little bit confused.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.800]   There's these intermediate types of investments.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.440]   It's the same way in the stock market, right?
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.520]   There's preferred equity.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.240]   And it's the same thing on the real estate side.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.760]   For example, there might be a debt investor that's
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.600]   got an 8% note on a property.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.920]   Well, they're going to make 8%.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.500]   But they're first in line.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.680]   If this property has to be foreclosed on,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.760]   they can foreclose on it, sell the property, get all their money back.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.720]   And then, of course, the equity investor is at the bottom of the capital stack.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.360]   So whatever's left over, in the event things go bad,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.840]   goes to the equity investor.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.920]   But there can also be different types of investors in between those two.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.160]   And that's usually called preferred equity or mezzanine debt.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.440]   Typically pays a higher interest rate.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.280]   For example, if that first note is 8%, this next note might be 14%.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.200]   And so it's a riskier position, has higher expected returns.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.520]   But those come, obviously, with higher risk.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.080]   I want to go through different types of properties
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.880]   because you list in your course class A properties, class B properties,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   class C properties, royal land.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.600]   Could you quickly go through these different classes of properties?
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.280]   Yeah, sure.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.240]   Class A is the nicest thing that just got built in the last few years.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.960]   It's luxury.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.520]   It's got granite countertops and tile floors.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.600]   And it's in a nice neighborhood and a nice school district.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.400]   And you're renting it out to professionals.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.000]   That's a class A property.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.560]   A class B property, it's a little bit older.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.600]   It might have been built 15 years ago.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   Lower income tenants are in there.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.400]   It's not quite as nice as it was when it was first built.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Maybe there's some deferred maintenance issues
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.520]   that need to be done on the property.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.560]   Class C properties might be 30 or more years old.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.360]   Again, they're not as nice as a class B property.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.960]   The tenants in there might be working class folks.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.680]   They might be on government subsidies and lower rents.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.520]   You're going to have a lot more ongoing maintenance, a lot more repairs
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.120]   than a class C property.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.920]   And a class D property, of course, is in the bad part of town.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.680]   If you've heard the term slumlord before, they own class D properties.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.040]   And they're rundown.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.840]   And the tenants don't have great credit.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.080]   But you're also buying them at a much higher capitalization rate
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.760]   than you would a class A property.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.480]   And so your returns might actually be better in a class D property
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.960]   than a class A property.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.700]   But there's just a lot more issues you're
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.160]   going to be dealing with to have that sort of an investment property.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.360]   And who decides whether what you're buying is class A, B, C, or D?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.120]   Well, that's the beautiful thing about it.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.680]   It's like a climbing grade for those rock climbers out there.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.200]   It's just consensus.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.280]   And of course, someone trying to sell something,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.640]   they're going to try to convince you it's class B.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.400]   And you as the buyer would have to really go look at it
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.000]   and understand it to realize this isn't class B property.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.160]   This is class C property.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.480]   And it's not worth paying nearly as much for.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.300]   And so there's no government agency that goes out and says,
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.140]   this is class A and this is class B. It's
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.540]   just by consensus among the investors in the market.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.000]   Let's discuss your real estate investing continuum.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.380]   You've put together this very nice graphic
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.940]   on your website, which shows on one side,
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.740]   you've got the direct investor in real estate
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.580]   who actually builds it from the ground up.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.800]   And all the way through the REIT investor
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.760]   at the end, who's just investing in public REIT.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.140]   And you've got all of these different ways
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.220]   which you can invest in real estate in the middle.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.440]   I'd like to just go through that list of eight different ways
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.540]   that you've laid out here very nicely in this chart.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.960]   Moving left to right, you start with ground up construction.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.500]   This is the person that goes to the city and gets the permits
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.440]   and digs the hole in the ground and puts the foundation in
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.960]   and builds the house and puts renters in it.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.680]   This is ground up construction.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.120]   Of course, you don't have to do that from the ground up.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.920]   You can buy something that's already been built.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.080]   You're just improving it and then
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.280]   selling it to somebody else who's going to rent it out.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.820]   That's generally called fix and flip.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.480]   A lot of people watch TV shows that talk about this
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.600]   and how people made money fixing and flipping up properties.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.000]   But that's one way to invest.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.800]   The next most active way to invest is short term rentals.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.200]   And what you're really doing here
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.840]   is you're running a hotel business.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.640]   You're renting these out to people.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.440]   Typically, they will have a stay that averages 5, 6, 7 days.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.760]   Lots of people are only in there for three or four days.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.480]   Some people will stay for a month.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.440]   But for the most part, short term rentals,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.440]   you're renting to people for a matter of days.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.160]   And so it's pretty active.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.960]   Somebody's got to get in there and clean it
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.720]   every three or four days.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.680]   You have to book a different tenant, essentially,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.200]   a different guest, multiple times a month.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.680]   And you're running a business.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.560]   So it's a pretty active thing.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.120]   Next, you come to long term rentals.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.520]   And these are people you typically
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.880]   rent to for a year, two years, or five years.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.000]   And so it's not nearly as actively involved
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   as short term rentals.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.960]   But as you might expect, you're also
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.440]   not charging them hotel rates.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.040]   And so there's less revenue involved as well.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.080]   That's a way a lot of mom and pop investors invest.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.440]   They buy a house, or they buy multiple houses,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.480]   or they buy a duplex or two, or some quadplexes,
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.800]   or they buy an eight-door apartment building.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.140]   A few years later, they buy another 10-door apartment
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.520]   building, and that's how they invest in real estate.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.060]   Some people do not want to be involved
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.760]   in that direct management role.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.320]   But they still want to own the properties themselves.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.920]   They want something they can drive by and show their friends
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.240]   or touch physically with their hands when they go to see it.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.960]   But they don't want any hassles.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.560]   And I call that category turnkey properties.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.720]   This is where somebody else is building the home.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.760]   Someone else is getting a renter in there.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   Someone else is managing the property.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.920]   When it's time for you to get out of the investment,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.000]   they will sell it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.560]   But you are the 100% owner of the home.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.460]   And there are services out there that
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.080]   will do that for you if that's how you
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.160]   want to invest in real estate.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.960]   The next step is what I mentioned earlier.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.360]   This is when you go in and take advantage
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.720]   of some economies of scale.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.960]   You want to own a big apartment complex.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.760]   Let's say the apartment complex has got 400 doors.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.240]   You can't afford this thing yourself.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.860]   It might cost $10 million, and you
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.240]   don't have that, much less enough
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.200]   to diversify that investment.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.360]   But if you went in with 100 other investors--
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.960]   typically it's 98 other investors,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.000]   because of the way the laws are written--
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.920]   you could buy that apartment complex.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.800]   But as that apartment complex does well or does poorly,
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.600]   you're going to share in the profits or losses there.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   And that's considered a syndication.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.560]   You're a partner in a partnership.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.400]   You get a K-1 every year.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.440]   Losses and gains are passed through to you on that K-1.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.160]   If you want more diversification than one apartment complex
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.600]   that you put $100,000 into, then you
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.440]   might want to look into private funds.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.160]   Instead of one complex, you might own a dozen of them.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.000]   They'll all be packaged together into a fund.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.600]   The fund might hold them for five or 10 years
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.840]   or indefinitely, and then sells off the properties.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.360]   And you get what you get in your share of the returns.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.240]   Obviously, there's somebody putting all that together,
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.360]   the general partner.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.640]   If it does well, they tend to do very well,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.040]   charge fees that are similar to hedge fund fees.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   1% a year and 20% of profits wouldn't
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.720]   be unusual for what they charge to run those funds
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.040]   and those syndications.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.880]   But the nice thing about it is once you buy it for you,
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.080]   it's mailbox money.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.840]   You have no role in the management
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.000]   after the initial due diligence period
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.360]   and purchasing the investment.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.280]   Do those funds have a maturity date?
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.120]   Do they eventually dissolve, or are they just ongoing?
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.640]   It depends.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.160]   Some are evergreen, and some--
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.200]   the intent is to dissolve them.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.000]   For an equity-type investment, those
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.960]   will typically run three to 10 years.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.160]   But they'll usually give themselves some wiggle room.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.320]   So if the market's not really good for selling real estate
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.860]   in six years, they might hold it for eight years
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.000]   in hopes of getting the investors a better exit price.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.200]   These are illiquid investments, terribly illiquid investments
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.440]   that you are locked into.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.040]   Once you sign up for the ride, you're in there.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.520]   And sometimes you don't even know exactly when your money is
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.240]   going to come back, especially if things are not going well.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.240]   And then finally, on the far right side
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.440]   of this real estate investing continuum
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.160]   is publicly traded REITs.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.880]   And these are typically large real estate properties,
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.520]   a large number of them that have been packaged up and securitized.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.820]   And you can trade them any day the markets are open.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.140]   You can buy a mutual fund that invests in 100 or more of them.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.700]   And they're very liquid and very transparent,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.220]   like every other company on the stock market.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.340]   But you're not going to have any control over them
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.620]   like you might if you bought the property next door,
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.600]   for instance.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.180]   And so as you travel from left to right across the continuum,
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.380]   you will see that less experience is required,
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.020]   but you will have less hassle.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.420]   You get more diversification and more liquidity,
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.140]   but you get less control.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.020]   The tax benefits tend to decrease
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.500]   as you move left to right.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.340]   And you tend to pay more layers of fees.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.860]   As a general rule, if you're not having to do anything,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.500]   you should expect lower returns than if you're over there doing
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.900]   fixing and flipping.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.620]   And so as a general rule, your returns will go down as well
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.180]   when you move left to right across the spectrum.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.820]   My second guest is from the REIT industry,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.740]   so we'll be covering that a little bit more later on.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.220]   So thank you for that spectrum.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.500]   But I want to get into, why do people buy real estate?
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.580]   Why do they get invested?
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.300]   Yes, you get a good rate of return,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.380]   granted as you go across your continuum from left to right,
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.020]   the return drops, as does your control.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.780]   But what are some of the other reasons?
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.860]   Well, I mean, the main reason you add anything
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.500]   to your portfolio is because it has solid returns
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.820]   and, hopefully, low correlation with the other assets
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.700]   in your portfolio.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.700]   So the reason I invest in real estate, if you boil it all down,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.080]   it's because it has high returns,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.460]   similar to my stocks that I invest in through index funds,
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.900]   and it has lower correlation.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.340]   How low that correlation is varies over time
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.180]   and, of course, is somewhat debatable,
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.140]   but that's the reason I invest in real estate.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.900]   Yes, there are some great tax breaks.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.180]   The one people like to talk about the most is depreciation.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.340]   And as you depreciate a property,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.700]   you're basically sheltering that rental income from taxation.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.260]   And done properly, you depreciate the property
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.180]   for a few years, and then you exchange it
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.500]   into a more expensive property and depreciate
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.940]   that property a few years and exchange into a bigger property
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.740]   and depreciate that a few years, and then you die.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.460]   And your heirs get a step up in basis of death,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.300]   and nobody ever pays capital gains
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.260]   or the depreciation recapture taxes on that depreciation.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.160]   So you could have tax-free income out of this property
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.380]   for decades and never pay taxes on that income.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.820]   And, you know, obviously you have to set it up
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.300]   just right to accomplish that, but that's a big draw
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   for a lot of people to get into real estate.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.660]   A lot of other people, it bothers them
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.060]   to invest in paper assets, right?
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.900]   They don't like investing in mutual funds or stocks or bonds
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.360]   'cause they don't feel like it's real.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.300]   They can't drive by and see it.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.740]   And some people really like that aspect
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.980]   of real estate investing.
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.240]   - So the exchange process where you exchange
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.740]   from one property to another, where you could,
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.860]   where you don't have the recapture of depreciation,
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.100]   and you don't have to pay the capital gain,
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.100]   1031 exchange, certain rules go around that,
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.020]   such as having to buy a property or identify a property
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.320]   within a few months and then buy it within six months.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.580]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.980]   - Yeah, I think that's exactly it.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.380]   I mean, it has to be an exchange.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.260]   It's supposed to be a similar property,
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.980]   but keep in mind that the IRS is pretty darn lenient
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.500]   on similarity between the properties.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.260]   But I think it's 60 days you have to identify the property
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.980]   and then you have to close within six months.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.180]   And so it's definitely something
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.380]   that a lot of people are very interested in.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.220]   There are companies out there that help you to do exchanges,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.980]   but obviously you don't want to let the tax tail
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.100]   wag the investment dog.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.220]   Buying a crummy property,
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.260]   even if you're able to exchange into it is not a good move.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.960]   And so you've got to find another good investment
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.700]   to exchange into and then somehow manage to sell the old one
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.800]   and buy the new one within six months of each other.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.700]   - I do want to cover that tax benefit though.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.000]   I mean, if you're in the highest tax bracket,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.380]   even if you didn't get a 1031 exchange,
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.740]   even if you were just selling the property,
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.540]   the recapture tax of the depreciation.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.940]   So you're in a 37% bracket.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.820]   You're getting income that would normally be taxable,
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.020]   but the depreciation on the property reduces your income
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.740]   and you're in a high tax bracket, say 37%.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.060]   But there's benefit to even those people if they sell,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.860]   they don't get taxed on that recapture of the depreciation.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.660]   They get taxed on the capital gain,
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.300]   but the recapture of the depreciation,
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.060]   the maximum tax rate on that is only 25%.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.100]   So there's actually even a benefit there.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.220]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.800]   You can tell when you look at the tax code
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.400]   that there's a lot of incentives in there
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.340]   to people to invest in real estate, to develop real estate,
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.580]   to make places where people can live.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.060]   This is clearly an activity that Congress
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.460]   and by extension, the IRS supports
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.980]   and they support it in the tax code.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.300]   - Generally in a portfolio, you have stocks, bonds,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.860]   and now we're talking about real estate.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.900]   What's your view of proper diversification?
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.380]   Let's say, 60/40, 60% stocks, 40% bonds,
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.600]   just using that as a base.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.100]   How would you fit real estate into your portfolio?
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.780]   - Well, I think you gotta remember
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.940]   that real estate's a risky asset to start with.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.860]   These are not treasury bonds.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.460]   Even if you're investing on the debt side,
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.740]   there's far more risk there
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.860]   than a typical bond portfolio would hold.
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.580]   So this is a risky asset.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.660]   So when you think about stocks and real estate,
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.940]   they both go in the same category of risky assets.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.140]   But I think a reasonable amount of real estate
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.500]   to have in your portfolio ranges anywhere from zero to 80%.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.100]   I think it's fine not to invest at all in real estate.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.580]   You do not have to invest in real estate
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.060]   to be a successful investor,
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.300]   to be financially independent,
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.500]   to leave lots of wealth to your kids.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.180]   Whatever your investing goals are,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.280]   you don't have to invest in real estate.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.600]   Some people just love real estate.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.980]   It is their thing.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.180]   I would caution those folks,
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.020]   invest at least 20% of your portfolio
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.760]   into the most profitable corporations
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.580]   the world has ever seen, i.e. the stock market,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.260]   and preferably via low-cost,
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.880]   broadly diversified index mutual funds, or ETFs.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.840]   I think it's really silly
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.160]   to put everything into real estate.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.020]   So even those folks,
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.140]   I think they ought to have at least 20% in stocks
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.020]   rather than everything in real estate.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.980]   In my portfolio, it's 60% stocks,
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.360]   20% bonds, 20% real estate.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.940]   But you don't have to match my portfolio
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.780]   for me to think what you're doing is reasonable.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.620]   I think someone that had 40% of their portfolio
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.580]   in real estate would be just as reasonable
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.540]   as somebody that only had 10%
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.340]   of their portfolio in real estate.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.820]   - I guess it gets down to one of the last charts
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.520]   I want to talk about, which you wrote about,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.140]   which is, what is the best way for me
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.460]   to invest in real estate?
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.020]   And this gets back to your spectrum of ways,
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.660]   or the continuum ways of, you know,
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.300]   you have to come up with a way of investing in real estate
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.020]   that suits you personally.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.260]   So can you talk about that?
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.900]   - Yeah, that's exactly the whole point of that prior chart
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.940]   about the real estate continuum,
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.540]   is it's not that one way is better than another.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.580]   It's that you've got to match yourself
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.660]   and what you want out of an investment
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.880]   to the particular type of investment.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.280]   You don't have to invest in real estate.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.480]   So the first thing you have to ask yourself
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   is do you want to add a little bit of complexity
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.380]   to your portfolio in hopes of getting
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.120]   a little bit more diversification,
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.600]   in hopes of maybe boosting returns?
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.440]   Yes or no.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.560]   And if the answer to that is yes,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.600]   then, you know, you can start looking
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.720]   at the different types of real estate.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.320]   So the next thing people need to ask themselves
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.840]   is are you willing to give up some liquidity
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.880]   and transparency and diversification?
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.440]   And do you qualify as an accredited investor?
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.920]   Because that's going to have a big impact
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   on what's available to you.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.360]   And if you're really not willing
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.480]   to give up liquidity and transparency,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.500]   you're going to be staying in the publicly traded markets.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.660]   We're talking about buying publicly traded REITs.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.660]   But if you're willing to give up some of that,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.400]   then you've got to ask yourself
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.720]   about how you feel about fees.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.400]   Because a lot of fees get added into this real estate space,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.920]   especially when you're looking at syndications,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.240]   when you're looking at funds.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.400]   You know, these fees look like hedge funds.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.240]   You know, they're substantial fees.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.840]   And if that really bothers you,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.200]   again, stick with the publicly traded REITs,
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.440]   and you won't see those sorts of fees.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.880]   Okay, the next question you'd ask yourself is hassle.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.640]   How much hassle are you really willing to deal with?
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.880]   And if you're willing to deal with a lot of hassle,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.160]   and you love real estate, you love making deals,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.660]   you love looking for properties,
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.120]   you don't mind working with tenants,
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.800]   you can go do direct real estate investing.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.080]   People have retired off nothing
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.120]   but their direct real estate investments.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.880]   It's a very profitable way to invest.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.120]   You got to learn what you're doing.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.240]   There's a learning curve.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.560]   But this is a very reasonable way to invest.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.540]   And some people do that.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.880]   They don't invest in mutual funds.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.280]   They invest in properties.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:53.060]   But again, if you're willing to deal with some hassle,
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.160]   now you're asking yourself,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.520]   are you an accredited investor or not?
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.680]   Because if you are not,
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.880]   then there are a very limited number
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.480]   of investments out there.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.800]   Most of them are what I call crowdfunded investments
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.760]   that don't require you to have accredited investor status.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   I'm not as bullish or positive about those returns.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.520]   I think a lot of times those are not
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.860]   the most experienced operators running those investments,
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.320]   but it is an option.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.660]   - You've mentioned accredited investor a couple of times.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.840]   Could you explain that?
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.000]   - An accredited investor, by definition,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.900]   is somebody who has at least $200,000 in income
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.720]   each of the last two years,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.920]   or $300,000 together with their spouse,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.600]   or has a million dollars in investable assets.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.720]   And there's some other requirements
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.040]   for trusts and businesses, et cetera.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.600]   However, that's just the legal definition.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.760]   The definition I think you should use
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.600]   when you decide if you're an accredited investor
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.560]   is number one,
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.820]   are you capable of evaluating the merits of an investment
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.660]   without the assistance of an attorney,
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.940]   an accountant, and a financial advisor?
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.840]   And number two,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.900]   can you lose your entire investment
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.640]   without it affecting your financial life
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.400]   in a significant way?
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.240]   And if those two are not both true,
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.160]   I wouldn't call yourself an accredited investor,
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.200]   even if you met the $200,000 income limitation,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.920]   which by the way, hasn't gone up with inflation for years.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.240]   - This is for syndicated real estate,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.640]   for private equity type real estate,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.320]   not for REITs, not for building your own.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.480]   - Yeah, this is for the most part,
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.640]   we're talking about syndication.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.520]   We're talking about, you know, these private funds.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.560]   But keep in mind, we say REITs,
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.260]   but the truth is a large number of these private funds
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.860]   have adopted REIT status for some various benefits.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.060]   So, you know, we throw out this term REITs,
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:36.900]   and most of the time,
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.600]   we mean these big publicly traded REITs,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.100]   but the truth is at least half the funds I'm invested in
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.760]   are REITs too.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.820]   - Well, that's a great place to end
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.140]   because my next guest is all about REITs.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.500]   Jim, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.340]   - Thank you, Rick.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.740]   It's a pleasure as always.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.180]   - Our next guest is Dr. John Wirth,
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.540]   Executive Vice President,
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.860]   Research and Investor Outreach at NARIT.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.380]   With no further ado, let me introduce John Wirth.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.140]   Welcome to the "Bogle Heads on Investing" podcast, John.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.060]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.260]   - So you're the Executive Vice President,
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.460]   Research and Investor Outreach at NARIT.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.820]   Tell us a little bit about your background
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.160]   and something interesting about yourself.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.540]   - Sure, well, I did a PhD in economics
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.300]   back in the mists of time,
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.860]   and then proceeded to go join the U.S. Treasury.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.300]   And I spent about 10 years at Treasury
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.540]   between 2000 and 2010.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.440]   So that included working through many aspects
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.620]   of the financial crisis and financial crisis recovery,
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.800]   which was probably the time in my life
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.140]   where I spent the least amount of time at home.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.220]   Many more all-nighters as a professional
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.660]   than I did as a student.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.400]   - Tell us a little about the environment at Treasury
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.820]   at that time during the financial crisis.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.280]   You were under Paulson, correct?
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.820]   - Yeah, with Hank Paulson in the Bush administration,
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.620]   and then there was a handover to Tim Geithner
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.900]   as the Obama administration came in.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.460]   I would say the attitude was one of a lot of flexibility.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.720]   That response crossed two administrations.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.480]   People tend to forget that.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.260]   And I think that there was a degree
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.560]   of admirable ideological flexibility
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.860]   and an ability to work together.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.140]   The handoff wasn't seamless,
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.180]   but it was as close to seamless
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.300]   as I think it could have been
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.260]   between a Republican and Democratic administration.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.700]   And I think that was a sense of common purpose
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.180]   that I think too often is lost today.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.180]   But I would say that had a lot to do
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.940]   with some of the successes in those programs
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.900]   that we ended up with and keeping the nation
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.620]   out of even more difficult economic environment
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.260]   than what we went through.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.220]   - And after that, you went to join
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.940]   the National Credit Union administration.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.740]   What was your role there?
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.460]   - I was the chief economist there,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.620]   and I actually went there to create
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.500]   the role of chief economist and stand up
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.100]   in office of chief economist.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.740]   And it was a great experience,
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.080]   a really educational experience.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.500]   I had been on the policymaking side,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.420]   but not really on the regulatory side.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.800]   So going over and working for a regulator,
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.420]   getting an appreciation for the challenges
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.100]   associated with bank and credit union regulation
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.300]   and what that means on a real day-to-day basis.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.900]   - And then you decided to go to NARATE,
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.540]   the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.700]   which is what that stands for, or used to stand for.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.980]   Now I think it's its own word, correct?
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.820]   - Correct.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.260]   - Can you tell us a little bit about NARATE
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.060]   and what your mission is?
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.340]   - Our mission is really to represent
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.140]   and be the voice for REITs and listed real estate companies
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.020]   that have an interest in the U.S.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.500]   Virtually every listed real estate company in the U.S.,
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.820]   every REIT in the U.S. is a member of NARATE.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.420]   We represent REITs of all types.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.780]   And that runs the gamut from making sure
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.520]   that REITs are well-represented in terms of policymaking
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.340]   and the political process, to what I do,
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.860]   which is our research efforts, but also investor outreach,
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.740]   getting out and making sure that investors of all types
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.980]   understand the attributes of real estate
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.560]   and how REITs can provide those attributes
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.740]   in a low-cost liquid form,
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.700]   as well as holding meetings, communications,
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.540]   making sure that the industry is cohesive
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.140]   and giving them opportunities to come together.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.180]   - Just for basics, how does a company qualify as a REIT?
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.140]   How does it become a REIT?
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.100]   - You qualify as a REIT by meeting a number
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.180]   of IRS requirements that are built into the law.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.400]   The most basic and the most key
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.940]   is that you need to be owning real estate assets
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.380]   and you need to be paying out 90% or more
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.780]   of your taxable income in the form of dividend.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.620]   And that's why REITs often are thought of
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.060]   as income-producing stocks,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.380]   because of that 90% requirement.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.420]   And the quid pro quo there
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.540]   is that if REITs meet those requirements,
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.620]   then they don't pay corporate taxes on that dividend
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.100]   that they've paid out to their shareholders.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.260]   Instead, the taxes are paid at the shareholder.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.060]   And what that does is that really aligns the taxation
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.060]   between owning real estate in the form of a partnership
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.100]   and owning real estate through a REIT.
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.500]   To a very close approximation,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.660]   a dollar of income through a REIT
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.700]   and a dollar of income through a partnership
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.260]   are gonna be taxed exactly the same way.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.420]   - Taxation of REITs is interesting
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.660]   because it is not taxed at a corporate level,
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.260]   which makes these investments unique.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.620]   And the dividends that come in is three types of income
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.500]   that come in from REITs.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.900]   There's ordinary income,
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.300]   which is the income you were talking about,
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.740]   generally from rent or from a mortgage payment.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.580]   Capital gains, sometimes they sell properties
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.060]   and make a profit.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.100]   And then there's a return of capital.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.980]   So I can understand the ordinary income from rent.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.140]   I can understand capital gains.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.500]   What is the return of capital?
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.060]   - So return of capital is important
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.620]   because the portion of the dividend
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.500]   that is paid as return of capital
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.940]   is not taxed at the shareholder level,
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.780]   although it does reduce the basis in the stocks.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.340]   So ultimately, when that stock is sold,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.580]   that will be accounted for.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.620]   And return of capital is really there
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.620]   to account for the situation
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.900]   because of various sort of accounting and tax situations
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.780]   where essentially a REIT or any other company
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.020]   is doing exactly what it says.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.820]   It's really returning capital
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.660]   that essentially hasn't been invested to the shareholders.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.900]   So that's the theory behind not having it taxed,
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.580]   but also reducing the basis.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.820]   - Now, there's a couple of other things about real estate.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.060]   The ordinary income portion of it
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.060]   is subject to the qualified business income deduction.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.660]   This changed during the Trump administration
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.740]   because corporations were being taxed at a lower tax rate.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.460]   Therefore, now this income from corporations
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.060]   needed to be taxed at a lower tax rate.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.940]   But since it was coming to us,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.820]   it was gonna be taxed as ordinary income.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.220]   So they said, well, we'll give you a reduction on this
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.340]   of 20%.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.340]   Did I say that correctly?
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.180]   - Yeah, I think you did a great job with that, Rich.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.260]   We tend to talk about this as 199A
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.740]   because that's how it's reported on your tax forms.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.100]   And really, it does exactly what you said.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.860]   It's basically a 20% discount on that tax on the dividends.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.540]   In fact, what it does is it really takes
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.180]   that amount of dividends, multiplies it by 0.8,
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.900]   and then applies the tax rate.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.660]   But that has been a way that we've seen for investors,
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.260]   for taxable investors in REITs,
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.940]   they've seen a really significant reduction
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.380]   in the tax they're paying on those dividends.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.620]   That 199A provision doesn't just apply to REITs,
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.660]   it applies to a lot of different types of real estate,
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.780]   whether publicly or privately held,
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.580]   can qualify for that 199A treatment.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.060]   Which is, again, that goes back to that consistency
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.260]   of treatment of income and returns of real estate
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.140]   between REITs and other types of holding,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.700]   which we think is very important.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.780]   We really want there to be that consistent,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.380]   even playing field between different ways
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.260]   you can hold real estate.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.100]   - Okay, very good.
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.100]   And it does get a little complicated
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.300]   because you also, depending on your income,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.580]   can be subject to the net investment income tax,
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.020]   not only on the ordinary income,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.500]   but also on the capital gains,
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   which is the way in which Obamacare is paid for.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.380]   - Correct.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.220]   - So 3.8%, but it only hits
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.300]   if you make above $250,000 a year,
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.540]   if you're filing jointly,
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.740]   or $200,000 if you're single.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.860]   So it doesn't affect everyone.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.140]   Well, there's also different types of REITs, right?
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.820]   There are equity REITs, mortgage REITs,
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.860]   public non-listed REITs,
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.500]   and then there's private REITs.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.340]   And so let's go through the difference.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.500]   Let's start with the easy one, equity REITs.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.780]   - So equity REITs, I think, are what people,
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.860]   when they think about a REIT,
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.580]   this is probably what they're thinking about.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.260]   This is a publicly traded company
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.780]   that owns and operates commercial real estate.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.420]   Today, the market capitalization of listed equity REITs
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.580]   is right around $1.3 trillion.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.220]   So it's a meaningful part of the stock market.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.460]   Listed equity REITs,
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.700]   they comprise one of the GIC sectors.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.460]   They're the 11th GIC sector of the stock market.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.740]   So they're really represented as a unique sector.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.860]   These are the companies who, through owning their stock,
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.820]   this is where you're getting access
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.420]   to the flow of rents from commercial real estate,
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.380]   with daily pricing, daily liquidity,
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.860]   the ability to buy and sell those holdings
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.780]   as frequently as you want,
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.660]   with, for most investors, effectively unlimited liquidity.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.060]   That's the equity REITs.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.180]   Mortgage REITs, very similar,
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.220]   publicly listed, publicly traded,
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.580]   but instead of owning and operating properties,
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.380]   they're typically going to own real estate debt.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.620]   So that could either be in the form of home mortgages,
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.740]   owning Fannie and Freddie mortgage-backed securities,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.340]   or it could be in commercial mortgages,
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.500]   either through commercial-curatized,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.780]   commercial mortgage-backed securities, or direct loans.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.100]   So when you think about the listed space,
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.460]   listed equity REITs make up about 95%,
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.580]   the mortgage REITs make up about 5%
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.580]   of that market capitalization.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.540]   The interesting thing about mortgage REITs,
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.740]   and one of the reasons why we see
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.620]   a lot of individual investor interest in mortgage REITs
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.860]   is because of their dividend yields.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.820]   They often pay double-digit,
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.620]   or recently have been paying double-digit yields,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.980]   so they've been a very high-yielding,
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.540]   income-driven investment.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.100]   - The yield is double-digit,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.180]   but is that due to return of capital,
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.140]   or is that due to actual just interest income?
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.700]   - Most of that is interest income.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.180]   - Wow.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.820]   Okay, the third one is public, non-listed REITs.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.780]   What are these?
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.260]   - These are another flavor of REIT,
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.780]   and these have grown in popularity
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.820]   over the last several years.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.780]   And so these are public REITs,
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.100]   so they are registered with the SEC,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.340]   they file 10-Qs and 10-Ks,
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.780]   they have all the transparency
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.660]   you associate with a public company,
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.420]   but they're not listed on the stock exchange.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.860]   So their shares don't trade on a daily basis,
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.980]   and they have somewhat limited liquidity.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.220]   You get liquidity in these stocks,
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.540]   typically by selling your shares back to the REIT,
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.460]   and they offer typically regular,
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.380]   typically on a monthly basis, liquidity opportunities,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.300]   but that liquidity can be limited.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.180]   In times when a lot of people
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.500]   wanna sell their shares back,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.220]   they may put on restrictions
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.740]   about how much you can sell back,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.980]   or those restrictions are set beforehand,
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.660]   but you may run into those restrictions.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.940]   When you think about non-traded REITs versus traded REITs,
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.620]   we like to think about it as really a trade-off
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.620]   between volatility and liquidity,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.660]   whereas with listed REITs,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.460]   you're getting full liquidity,
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.540]   daily moment-to-moment pricing,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.340]   the ability to exit and enter your positions
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.660]   whenever you want,
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.100]   and valuations that are stock-like valuations,
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.340]   they're estimates of future profitability,
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.940]   discounted to today,
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.100]   but you live with that day-to-day,
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.540]   moment-to-moment volatility of the stock market.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.780]   With non-traded REITs, by contrast,
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.580]   you have limited liquidity,
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.740]   you have valuation that is more akin
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.740]   to private real estate valuations,
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.500]   which are sort of backward-looking,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.660]   based on appraisals, more slow-moving,
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.140]   so they're not gonna price in changes
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.340]   in the economic environment quickly
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.140]   the way listed REITs will,
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.820]   so you avoid that volatility,
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.260]   but you don't have the same amount of liquidity.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.860]   - We've also heard in the press
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.660]   that there's been some miscommunication
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.620]   between the brokers who sell these public non-listed REITs
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.420]   and the consumers who buy them,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.820]   where there's been some recent arbitration.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.100]   Do you wanna comment on that?
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.620]   - Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a product
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.540]   that is marketed to a high-net-worth individuals,
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.420]   sometimes sold through brokers,
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.940]   sometimes sold directly by the REITs themselves,
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.660]   and I think with all of these products,
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.500]   it's really very important for people to understand
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.100]   what are the attributes of the product
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.380]   and what's it gonna bring and what's it not gonna bring,
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.500]   and we think that's true
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.420]   across the full range of REIT products.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.340]   - And the last one is a private REIT,
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.140]   which is for mostly institutional investors.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.820]   Briefly, what are these?
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.700]   - So private REITs are exactly as described, right?
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.180]   They are not listed on a stock exchange.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.220]   They don't file with SEC.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.780]   They're really marketed individually.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.780]   They might be used inside of a structured product.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.500]   It might be part of another partnership.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:39.260]   So most investors are not gonna run across private REITs
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.340]   in their ordinary course of business.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:47.220]   - So in aggregate, you write in your reports
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.500]   that about 4 trillion in gross assets
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.900]   across the U.S. are in REITs,
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.260]   with public owning 2.5 trillion,
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.180]   which means 1.5 trillion
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.660]   would be a non-public and institutional or private.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.460]   And then you have here that U.S. listed REITs
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.620]   have an equity market capitalization
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.700]   of more than 1.3 trillion.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.980]   So I guess I don't understand the question here
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.180]   is public REITs own 2.5 trillion
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.540]   and equity markets are 1.3 of the 2.5.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.860]   Am I reading that correctly?
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.420]   - We've really got two separate concepts going on here
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.020]   because what we're talking about is the valuation
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.140]   of the underlying real estate.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.340]   So equity market capital only captures part of the value,
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.620]   right, because they're also holding debt.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.900]   It's really hard to compare these two concepts.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.900]   Our estimate is that the public REITs
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.220]   own about 2.5 trillion,
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.140]   could be anywhere between 2.5 trillion and 3 trillion
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.380]   in commercial real estate
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.500]   with the balance owned by private REITs.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.060]   - So about 3% of the U.S. equity market.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.860]   - REITs make up about 3% of most equity indexes, yeah.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.020]   - And it's been that way for quite a few years.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.260]   Has it not?
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.580]   - Well, it depends how far you go back.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.980]   If you look back to say 1990,
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.500]   you would have seen a REIT market capitalization
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.260]   of just about $10 billion.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:19.060]   And that has grown dramatically today to about 1.3 trillion
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.220]   as we saw a wave of IPOs in the 1990s
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.580]   and the evolution of the industry.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.220]   Over the last three or four years,
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.460]   REITs have been in this 2% to 3% of the S&P 500
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.780]   or the Russell 1000 range.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.300]   - So talking about the history of REITs,
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.660]   this is a little bit interesting.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.540]   I mean, no REITs existed prior to 1960.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.940]   That's when Congress established the ability
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.900]   to be able to do real estate pass-through.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.980]   And it took off a little bit.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.700]   I mean, you had some companies coming public.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.900]   They were, you know, some shopping centers,
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.700]   even some railroads, some lodging, and so forth.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:02.100]   But it really took off when the law changed in 1986,
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.860]   which gave REITs the ability to operate
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.460]   and manage real estate rather than simply owning it
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.820]   and financing it, which was the original concept.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.180]   So could you talk a little bit about the history of REITs
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:19.540]   and what happened and why during the early 1990s,
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.700]   there was not a lot of REITs,
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.140]   but then now it's growing in many different areas.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.620]   - Yeah, and just going back sort of in 1960,
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.380]   Congress passed the first REIT legislation.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.660]   And, you know, we always think it's very interesting
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.460]   because the purpose of that was to allow everyday investors
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.220]   to get access to commercial real estate
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.380]   as part of their portfolios.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.380]   Really, the REIT legislation was inspired
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.620]   by the mutual fund legislation.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.700]   Same concept, let's let a broader base of investors
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.420]   get access to stocks in the case of mutual funds,
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.980]   real estate in the case of REITs.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.620]   And it's important to sort of, you know,
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.300]   when you look at that big picture,
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.340]   I think it's very interesting that today,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.140]   we estimate about 170 million Americans
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.820]   live in households that own REITs.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.700]   So this has been a public policy success.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.860]   We've gotten that broad-based ownership
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.220]   of commercial real estate through REITs.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.100]   So it has really done what it set out to accomplish.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.860]   Now, when we look at how it got there,
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.460]   between 1960 and 1990,
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.020]   I would say that REITs were really a niche product.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.220]   They were generally not in the big stock indexes.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.740]   They were not well-known.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.220]   They were generally small cap companies.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.780]   What we saw in the late '80s and early '90s
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.420]   was a few changes.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.140]   One was the 1986 Act
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.180]   that allowed the internal management of REITs,
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.020]   which has been absolutely critical
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.100]   to the success of REITs in the U.S.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.140]   We also saw what's called the creation
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.740]   of the up-REIT structure
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.060]   that actually allowed individuals who owned real estate
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.540]   to transfer that real estate into a REIT
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.660]   without it being a taxable event.
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.260]   And the confluence of those two factors
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.860]   with the commercial real estate crisis of the early 1990s,
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.700]   which resulted in a number of real estate investors
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.340]   needing to recapitalize their properties,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.500]   that really resulted in what we call
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.660]   sort of the modern REIT era starting in early 1990s,
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.020]   where we saw a wave of IPOs
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.460]   and the creation of what are today
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.900]   some of the leading, not just listed real estate companies,
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.860]   but the leading real estate companies in the world as REITs
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.460]   because of that ability to be internally managed,
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.460]   to be organized as a corporation,
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.780]   and to build out the human capital,
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.500]   the prop tech need, the data science needs,
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.460]   everything you need to be a leading-edge company
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.140]   in real estate today.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.740]   - And some of the properties that have become REITs,
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.260]   the list is growing.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.100]   Imaginative, I guess you could say.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:56.660]   In 1986, self-storage started to come online,
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.220]   and that's been a big player in the REIT space.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.180]   Factory outlets, movie theaters, correctional facilities.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.620]   I remember that wave that occurred in the 1990s.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:11.100]   And then telecom towers, the cell towers that we see,
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.860]   those became REITs, and then 2004, data centers.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.620]   And then it was pipelines.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:22.620]   And later on in 2015, electric transmission lines
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.980]   and fiber optics.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.860]   And 2019, the first post office became a REIT.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.220]   And these have really grown.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.300]   I mean, if you look at the industry groups
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.260]   within the REIT index,
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   it's these new niche areas that have really expanded.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.020]   Can you talk about the changing real estate market
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.500]   out there for REITs?
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.460]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.340]   And Rick, I think this is one of the most important points
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.340]   for investors to understand about REITs
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.580]   and commercial real estate.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.660]   I think often we think about commercial real estate
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.780]   and we think, okay, office, retail,
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.060]   maybe multifamily residential,
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.220]   possibly people put industrial on that list.
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.540]   And those are all very important components
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.580]   of the REIT marketplace today.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.020]   Those four sectors make up about half of the market cap,
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:18.020]   but we've seen a tremendous growth and innovation
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.620]   in terms of property sectors and REITs.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.220]   And one of the things we like to say here
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.340]   is that real estate houses the economy.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.340]   That's kind of the way I like to think about it.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.660]   And so you would expect that real estate
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.620]   would be as innovative as the economy as a whole
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.060]   and to grow with the shape of the economy.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.260]   And REITs have really accomplished that.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.820]   You know, if you go back to 2000,
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.540]   you'll see that 75% of the market cap
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.540]   was in traditional four property types,
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.900]   residential, retail, industrial, and office.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.900]   Today, that's down to about 50%.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.820]   And the balance has been taken up
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.340]   with things like cell phone towers, as you mentioned,
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.940]   data centers, which were the best performing
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.780]   property sector in 2023, driven by the AI demand wave,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.580]   healthcare, self-storage, hotels, timber,
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.940]   and the list goes on.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.660]   And REITs have really been a place where that innovation
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.820]   in terms of property sectors have really found a home.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.900]   So today, one of the things that we see
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.020]   is that institutional investors
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.340]   might have a well-established portfolio
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.060]   of private real estate.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.500]   One of the things they're turning to REITs for
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.940]   is actually access to these new
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.420]   and emerging property sectors,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.700]   where REITs have been the innovators and the first movers
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.580]   and have really gained a leading position.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.460]   So investors, we out here in the marketplace,
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.660]   can access REITs either directly, if they're traded,
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.020]   we can buy them through exchange-traded funds,
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.780]   we can buy them through mutual funds,
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.380]   and there are different sectors that we can buy as well.
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.620]   You also get them if you're in a target date fund,
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.740]   for example, if you're in a Vanguard fund
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.860]   or a State Street fund or T. Rowe Price
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.260]   target retirement fund,
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.900]   I mean, they're going to have REITs in there.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.940]   So more than likely you're going to own
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.220]   what we're talking about today.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.580]   And so we need to talk about the performance.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.140]   And I've been watching this market since the 1980s
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.540]   when I came into the business.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.860]   It seems to me as though in the long-term
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:24.420]   that you would expect REITs, property REITs,
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.300]   to perform about as well as the large cap market,
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.700]   S&P 500 or Russell 1000.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   Would you agree with that,
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.860]   that that's what we're looking for?
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.060]   Yeah, historically what we've seen,
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.420]   and there's different ways to look at it,
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.060]   but when you look at that long-term performance,
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.740]   typically you're going to see that REITs are at
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.140]   or maybe a little bit above a broad-based stock
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.340]   in terms of their performance.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.180]   So it depends on the time period you look at.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.940]   Sometimes when you put real estate into a portfolio,
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.780]   and I've said this,
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.980]   is that it's a different asset class than common stock.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.700]   And the correlation between real estate
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.460]   and the rest of the market, the other 97%,
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.980]   at times you can have negative correlation
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.980]   between REITs and the rest of the equity market.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.460]   And there are times when it's positive correlation.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.540]   So can you speak to the diversification benefits?
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.100]   Absolutely, and I think for most of your listeners,
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.500]   this is going to be the core of why real estate
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.940]   in a portfolio is important, and I would say critical.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:32.500]   It's that ability to diversify the portfolio
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.060]   while getting competitive returns.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.820]   Depending on the time period you look at it
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.020]   and the data source you're going to look at,
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.620]   you're going to see REIT correlation
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.780]   with the broader stock market,
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:46.460]   anywhere between 0.55, 0.65,
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.260]   maybe up to 0.7 over some periods.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.500]   By the way, that's on a scale of negative one
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.580]   to positive one?
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.620]   Correct, right.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.660]   And when you look at your sort of alternatives out there
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.060]   to get diversification in a portfolio,
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.420]   if you think I could use large cap, small cap,
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.940]   value, growth, international,
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:07.780]   when you put those on a scale,
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.940]   you're going to see most of those stock alternatives
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.940]   are going to have correlations that are typically above 0.9
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.940]   and almost always above 0.85.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.980]   So among those alternatives that you can use
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.860]   to get diversification in a portfolio,
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.380]   REITs really stand out.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.980]   And that's one of the reasons why we've done studies
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.380]   with Morningstar, Ibbotson, Wilshire,
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:32.060]   a number of firms where we asked,
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:35.340]   what is the optimal portfolio look like
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.580]   and how does real estate play a role in that?
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.020]   And what we find is that those results
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:44.460]   are typically coming in anywhere between five and 15%
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.300]   real estate in a portfolio,
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.300]   depending on the risk tolerance of the investors.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.980]   That five to 15, is that assuming a portfolio of all equity
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.820]   or is it a 60% equity, 40% bond portfolio?
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.860]   - Yeah, so that's an equity and bond portfolio
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.060]   and you'll see REITs taken a bit out of the equities,
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.580]   a bit out of the fixed income portion.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.420]   - I would have thought
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.740]   that you just take it out of the equity,
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.580]   but what you're saying is if you have a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.300]   60% equity, 40% bonds,
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.060]   you may want to go to maybe 50% equity,
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.260]   35% bonds and 15% real estate.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.660]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.660]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.300]   Because what you're going to see in these optimal portfolios
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:30.780]   is that the REITs are providing equity-like returns,
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.500]   but because they're income providers,
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.700]   there's also some bond-like stability in there.
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.220]   - Well, you also do an Outlook, Android Economist.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.140]   I mean, this is what you get paid for, right?
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.940]   We have to discuss the future.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.980]   What do you see the future of REITs to be?
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:52.340]   - Well, we think 2024 could be a good year for REITs.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.620]   REIT performance during the first three quarters of 2023
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.700]   was pretty tough going.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.340]   And in 2022, REITs had pretty tough going performance
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.620]   because as Fed was adjusting monetary policy,
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.620]   REITs really bore the brunt of that
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.020]   in terms of their valuations.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:13.820]   What we saw in the fourth quarter was a real turnaround
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:18.300]   where REITs returned 18% for the quarter
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.180]   and outperformed the broader stock market.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.580]   And that's very consistent with one of the key themes
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.900]   in our Outlook, which is that historically,
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.100]   REITs have performed very well
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.460]   at the end of monetary policy rate rising cycles.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:36.020]   Another piece of REITs that I think is important
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.700]   is that we are going to be
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.900]   in a higher interest rate environment in 2024,
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.460]   and that can be a difficult environment
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.420]   for commercial real estate,
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.900]   but REITs are coming in
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.820]   with very well-managed balance sheets.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.780]   So REITs have been sort of low leverage players.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.140]   They are not using a large amount of debt
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:56.540]   in their strategies.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.620]   And the debt that they have is mostly fixed rate debt.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:02.900]   So we think that gives REITs both the ability
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.700]   to navigate a period of higher interest rates,
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.180]   but also maybe find opportunities
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.180]   where higher leverage borrowers
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.780]   have stepped out of the market.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.420]   So we think there's a lot of positives in 2024 for REITs.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.580]   - As privately held real estate,
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.220]   which is more highly leveraged,
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.740]   has to refinance at higher rates,
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.780]   it becomes distressed.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.220]   And it's the REITs that have equity, more cash,
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.780]   rather than debt that are gonna be able
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:35.260]   to pick up these properties at good valuations.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.740]   - Yeah, we think there's the possibility of that happening.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.060]   And one of the things we've seen historically
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.980]   is that as we go through the commercial real estate cycle,
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.340]   one of the periods where REITs tend to do really well
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.300]   is essentially early in recovery
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.780]   because they tend to do a good job getting out of properties
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.540]   before they're too overvalued,
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.380]   and then getting back in early in the cycle.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.220]   As we have talked to the management teams
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.620]   who are running the REITs,
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:03.740]   we know that that is something
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.100]   that is very much on their mind.
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.740]   They feel like their balance sheets
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.660]   are in a very strong position.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.940]   And when property markets open up
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.300]   and we start to see transactions,
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.980]   they feel like they can really be in there
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.980]   growing their portfolios and growing their businesses.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.580]   - Well, John, thank you so much for joining us
