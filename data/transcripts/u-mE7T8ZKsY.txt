[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - We are back again with John Piper
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   and a podcast listener named Kevin writes in to ask this.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.120]   Pastor John, in light of everything happening
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   with Planned Parenthood,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.720]   how do I faithfully give to Caesar what is Caesar's
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.800]   when that money is clearly being used to kill babies?
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.120]   We make our disapproval known by speaking out
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   and calling for the end of abortion,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.520]   but what about our tax dollars
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.480]   that continue to fund abortion?
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.000]   Pastor John, how would you guide Kevin
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.240]   in thinking through this?
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.800]   - Let me mention a principle that guides me
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.760]   and then secondly, my practice and why
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.960]   and third, an uncertainty that I have.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.040]   The principle is that responsibility
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.040]   for sharing in another person's sin, like the government,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.200]   rises and falls with how much we know
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.040]   and intend to be part of the cause of that sin.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.520]   So if you're a janitor in a giant corporation
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.560]   of 10,000 employees and the CEO
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   in the upper level management team have been found
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.160]   to have cheated customers for the last five years
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.720]   in an elaborate scheme of deception,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.200]   then you in your role as janitor would, I think,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.080]   not bear any guilt for that action,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.560]   even though you are contributing
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.920]   to the existence of that company.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.920]   But if you're an administrative assistant
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.360]   to one of those upper level managers
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.200]   and you figured out what they were doing along the way
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.880]   and said nothing, you'd be guilty.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.040]   The Bible makes a distinction, I think,
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.720]   between intentional evil and accidental
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.240]   or unknowing participation in evil.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240]   For example, Moses writes about these refugee cities,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.600]   the cities of refuge.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   He says, "If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.960]   "without having hated him in the past,
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.800]   "as when someone goes into the forest
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.480]   "with his neighbor to cut wood,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.960]   "then his hand swings the ax to cut down a tree
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.480]   "and the head slips from the handle
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.160]   "and strikes his neighbor so that he dies,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   "he may flee to one of these cities and live."
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.200]   So the innocent man was not intending to kill his friend.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.680]   In fact, he had no intention to sin at all.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.920]   And in that sense, he had no plan
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.080]   and was ignorant of the harm that was about to happen.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.600]   And that lack of knowledge and lack of intention
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   is morally significant.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.800]   That's my principle.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.040]   So my principle is not identical to that,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440]   but it's built on that.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520]   If you have no intention to participate in a sin
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.720]   and if your part in causing it is so remote,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.640]   like this janitor, and so distant as to be negligible,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.320]   then you're not guilty.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.640]   So there's the principle.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.400]   Now here's my practice and why.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.800]   I pay my taxes to the American government,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.120]   have for 50 years, no, 45 years.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   And my reason is first,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.320]   the Bible says that this is one of the rights of the state
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.120]   to collect taxes to fund its duties.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.040]   So Romans 13,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.200]   "Let every person be subject to governing authorities,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   "for there is no authority except from God
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.200]   "and those that exist have been instituted by God.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.680]   "He is God's servant for your good,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   "for because of this, you also pay taxes," verse six,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.720]   "for the authorities are ministers of God
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.160]   "attending to this very thing.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.560]   "Pay to all what is owed them,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.600]   "taxes to whom taxes are owed,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.920]   "revenue to whom revenue is owed,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.880]   "respect to whom respect is owed,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.200]   "honor to whom honor is owed."
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.360]   So I think it's fair to say that when this was written,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.240]   the Roman Caesar did not use all of that money
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.280]   for actions Christians would have approved of.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.760]   So that's my first reason for why I pay taxes
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.240]   to a government that has lots of policies
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.480]   that I would probably change.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   A second reason is I think we should keep on paying taxes,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   whether we approve of all of the expenditures or not,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.800]   because we're giving to a general fund
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.040]   and we're not able to put our taxes
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.080]   into specific purposes or funds.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.400]   If we were, if that were the situation in which we lived,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.160]   I can give an abortion tax
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.280]   and I can give a social security tax
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.800]   and I can give a military tax
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.900]   and I can give a welfare tax and so on,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.960]   then I think we would be bound to withhold the money
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.800]   from the abortion tax, but we don't.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   It's not operated like that.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.760]   Tax dollars are spent according to how the government wishes
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.880]   and we don't get to determine that directly.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.720]   So we would pursue, and I think God would hold us
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.440]   accountable to pursue other ways
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.640]   to change the government's decisions
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.840]   about where to spend the money.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   So my practice is, yes, I keep on giving money to government
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.600]   that is funding abortion.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.160]   Now here's my uncertainty.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.860]   When does a government forfeit its rightful claim
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.860]   to fulfill what God says is his purpose for government,
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.980]   namely to punish those who do evil
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.020]   and reward those who do good, 1 Peter 2.14.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.800]   There are two issues here.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.120]   One is when it might be right
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.640]   to simply withhold your support
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.520]   and the other more aggressively,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.920]   when might it be right to overthrow the government
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.520]   like America did with the tyranny of Britain?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.000]   And that's my uncertainty.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.180]   I'm not sure where that line is.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.100]   In fact, I tremble at the possible necessity
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.880]   of making that decision some day.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.120]   There are so many factors, it seems to me,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   that would go into such a choice,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.720]   just as there are a lot of factors
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.840]   that go into determining what a just war is.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.800]   So I would encourage Kevin and all of us
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.000]   to immerse ourselves in God's word
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.340]   and think about these things
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.080]   and pray earnestly for our nation and for ourselves.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.760]   We don't know what's coming.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.780]   - No, we sure don't.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.740]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.480]   And thank you for the excellent question, Kevin.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.060]   To send John Piper a question
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.960]   or to download the podcast apps
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.780]   or for really anything you might need to know
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.160]   related to this podcast,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.900]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.740]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.780]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.140]   (whooshing)
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
