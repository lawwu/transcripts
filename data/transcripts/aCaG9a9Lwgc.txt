[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   We have received the same question from a number of listeners through email over
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.280]   the past few weeks, and this is the question, Pastor John. Is Jesus the only
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:20.240]   way to be saved? Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.800]   the Father except through me." So Jesus himself is saying there isn't any other
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.160]   pathway to the Father except through me. And then Peter later in the book of Acts
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.560]   picks that up. He says in Acts 4, 12, "There is no salvation in anyone else, for
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.760]   there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   saved." And so Peter is taking Jesus' words and he's carrying them forward into the
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.840]   mission of the Church, and saying there isn't any other name out there on which
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.160]   you can call in order to be saved. And another amazing way Jesus addresses
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   this, it seems to me, is that he makes the embrace of himself as the crucified and
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.960]   risen Messiah the litmus test of other religions. So if you're talking with
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.040]   somebody who has their set of religions, and you want to test to see whether they
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.000]   have saving faith, what you do is you put Jesus and his fullness out on the table
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.720]   for them to see, and see if they will embrace Jesus. Because Jesus said, "You
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.440]   know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also." If
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.680]   you knew me, you would know my Father also. In other words, knowing me is the
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.520]   condition of truly knowing my Father, namely God, the Creator of the world.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.280]   That was John 8, 19. In John 5, 23, Jesus said, "Whoever does not honor the Son does
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.640]   not honor the Father who sent him." So he makes himself, the honoring of himself, as
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.320]   the litmus test of honoring the Father. Or John 6, 45, "Everyone who has heard and
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.520]   learned from the Father comes to me." So if a person won't come to Jesus as the
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.680]   Savior, as the one who died for sins, as the one who rose from the dead, then Jesus
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.320]   says, "All their claims notwithstanding, they have learned from the Father." When
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.960]   you go to Paul in the New Testament, one of the most amazing passages that have
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.800]   had a missionary impact on me is Romans 5, 12, following where Paul sets up Adam as
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.200]   the head of a race of people, all of us who have fallen and are under
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.040]   condemnation, and Christ as the second Adam, as the head of a new humanity, so
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.200]   that in Christ we are now counted as righteous the way we were counted as
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.680]   sinners in Adam, which means that in Paul's mind, the problem of the entire
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   human race, every religion in the world, every tribe and people in the world, is
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.440]   the same, namely alienated from God in Adam, and Jesus comes into the world as
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.000]   the answer to that problem. There isn't another answer out there because there
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.080]   isn't another problem out there. So Paul's conception of how to think about
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.400]   being remedied from our human condition is that Adam brought it into being, and
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.640]   Christ is the only answer to it. And then he spells it out for missions, Paul
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.920]   does in Romans 10, where he says, "Everyone who calls upon the name of the
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.880]   Lord will be saved. How shall they call upon the name of the Lord in whom they've
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.900]   not believed, and how shall they believe in whom they've not heard, and how shall
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.880]   they hear without someone preaching? Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   the word of Christ." Now I think that sequence of thought is Paul's decisive
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   word about missions in regard to, "Are there other ways out there for people to
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.640]   call upon the name of the Lord and be saved?" And he's saying, "No, there's
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.800]   one name, it's Jesus. They have to hear about him. In order to hear about him,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.760]   they have to be messengers, or missionaries, or preachers, or people to
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.600]   share the gospel, and that's the way faith is awakened, and salvation comes
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.040]   through faith." So my conclusion, Tony, in response to that first question is, yes,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.440]   the Bible does present Jesus as the one way among all the religions of the
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.640]   world, which is why there is such a weighty mandate on the Church to spread
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.440]   the gospel to all the peoples of the world. There's no salvation without
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.520]   knowing and embracing, believing Christ as the one who died for our sins and
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.800]   rose again. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
