[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.160]   This is a special edition of the show recorded in advance while I'm traveling for two weeks
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.880]   here in the month of September. If this is your first time listening to the show,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.000]   feel free to listen to today's show. I'm glad to have you here. I'd encourage you also to
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.920]   check out the archives and also check out the shows that are starting after October
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.160]   so that you can see the more normal flow of the show. But today's show is going to be essentially
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:07.600]   a short audio essay, short monologue on some ideas that I think would be helpful, that are helpful
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.240]   to me and I hope might be helpful to you. Today I would like to share with you a couple of
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.400]   ideas about hobbies. One of the things that I learned, I'll tell a short story, which is where
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.480]   this thought really came from, and I've proved it out with other research that I've done, but
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.920]   I had, when I was working as a financial planner, I had a really unique experience. I was a brand
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.640]   new financial planner, I think my second or third year in the business, and completely
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.040]   wet behind the ears, didn't know what I was doing, was working very well-meaning and
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.600]   well-intentioned, but I didn't know what I was doing. And I was sitting and talking with a
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   prospective client. And this prospective client was working for a business. He was the manager
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.800]   of some department. And he agreed to meet with me and we had one meeting and then we had another
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.920]   meeting. And the second meeting we were going over some of his assets and he kept listing more
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.000]   things off, kind of off the top of his head, but he wasn't really sure exactly where everything was
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.360]   and what all he had. And I had had him do some homework and bring actual statements, and he
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.840]   didn't open his mail, he didn't look at his statements to some of you. You're shaking your
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.400]   head and you're saying, "How could this be possible? I promise it's more people than you
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.120]   might think." But he never looked at anything. He just didn't bother. And as we're totaling
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.200]   things up, we get to the end of the total as we're constructing a balance sheet for him,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.720]   and I find out that we discovered together that he's a millionaire. And he was genuinely surprised
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.320]   and genuinely shocked that he was a millionaire. He had no idea that he was a millionaire.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   And again, some of you are hearing this and saying, "How is that possible?"
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.440]   So many people have a goal of becoming a millionaire. Here's someone who's a millionaire
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.880]   who simply doesn't have the goal. And he was really surprised, pleasantly. I mean,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.520]   he knew that he had money, he just never worried about money and he didn't pay too much attention
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.360]   to stuff. He just kind of let stuff flow over time. So as I got to know him more and more,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:24.480]   I started to see some themes in his life that really stood out to me. And these are themes
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.920]   that I have seen confirmed in academic literature and also just an experience in many ways.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440]   And Tom Stanley would be proud that one of the themes was that he had a modest home,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.520]   just a modest middle-class house. Tom Stanley talks a lot about that as being a major predictor
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.880]   of wealth because with the housing development that you live in, there are associated lifestyle
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.400]   costs with that house that have to be accounted for. And it kind of drives everything else. But
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.040]   he lived in a modest house, not cheap, certainly not cheap. Again, I live in South Florida, so I
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.080]   guess there's not really anything that's cheap, but not cheap, but also not expensive, just kind
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.960]   of mainstream, middle-class. And he drove some older cars, but he was not particularly frugal
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.600]   with cars. I think he and his wife each drove, I can't remember at this point, it was either Honda
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.040]   or a Toyota sedan of some kind. But I think they bought their cars new. It was not really a big
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120]   deal, but they kept them for a while. They just weren't really car people. But as I dug out,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   what stood out to me about this person's experience was that this person, I found out,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.800]   that their favorite hobby was mountain biking. And we live in Florida, and there's not a lot
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   of great mountain biking hills around, but he still enjoyed mountain biking. And what his idea
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.640]   of a good time was to take the weekend off and drive up north somewhere and go mountain biking.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.760]   And it really struck me that this was the person's primary hobby. Now, he had a good income, not a
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.640]   phenomenal income. He wasn't making a half a million bucks. I think he was six figures, but
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.240]   not multiple six figures. I don't remember right now. But just simply had a good income,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.320]   moderate expenses, just kind of spent on what he wanted to spend money on. But his hobby was
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.280]   mountain biking. And as I talked to him, I just found out he really loved it. He really loved to
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   go and travel, and they really loved to go to these tournaments and these races and take his
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.360]   bike and be involved in the community. And it just struck me that the value of having a relatively
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.200]   inexpensive hobby. Now, I'm not an expert in mountain biking. I'm sure you could spend lots
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   and lots of money at mountain biking, but as with any hobby and any sport, but he didn't spend a lot
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.240]   of money on it. And you compare it just the built-in costs to many things. There is a much
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.760]   less of a built-in cost of mountain biking than many other things. So I like to ride motorcycles
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.520]   when I have the opportunity. There's a big difference between buying an entry-level Harley
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.600]   for what, I don't know what they go for, 17, 20,000 bucks, probably 20 plus thousand bucks,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.360]   even for an entry-level Harley. And by the time you get one of the fancy ones, you're at 25,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:21.680]   30 grand easy. So there's a big difference between buying a $20,000 motorcycle versus a really nice
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.160]   $2,000 mountain bike. And I'm sure there's ones that are 10,000, but again, we're out of my area
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.120]   of expertise. But I was struck by just how this guy had just kind of accidentally stumbled into
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.920]   wealth because he had a moderate lifestyle. And it made me think about how can I proactively
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.160]   choose my hobbies that will serve all of my best interests. There are a lot of ancillary benefits
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:56.080]   from mountain biking that he didn't really even talk about. For example, I would guess that Harley
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.400]   riders on average tend to be more overweight than mountain bike enthusiasts on average.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.480]   Probably exceptions, but I bet that if I did some research that I could probably prove that one.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.680]   You prove me if I'm wrong, but that just one seems intuitive to me. Well, I would also bet
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.760]   that if you actually study the lifespan, that extra level of weight would probably lead to
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:31.680]   extra levels of length of life, excuse me, extra lifespan. And I just thought,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.760]   what a neat ancillary benefit. Here, this guy has more money and he has more health and he has
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.720]   a longer lifespan. He has greater enjoyment of his current health and a longer anticipated lifespan
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.600]   just simply because he chose to get interested in mountain biking versus getting interested in
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   Harley riding. Huh. Now, if you take this idea and you compound it, you can find an amazing
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:09.920]   ripple effect in every area. Example, I think as I remember, he either had a sedan or he had one of
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.000]   those small hatchback cars, like these crossover things, like the Toyota Matrix type of thing,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.480]   like a Pontiac vibe, Toyota Matrix type of vehicle. I don't remember specifically, so I'm
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.200]   going with an impression here, not a specific fact. So forgive me if I'm wrong. I mean, none
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.680]   of you know who I'm talking about, but I just have this impression that he had that kind of car.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:37.760]   If this man were a Harley rider and he wanted to go and pursue a, go on a motorcycle ride,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.960]   and if he wasn't, if he weren't going to ride the motorcycle there, then, which many Harley
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.800]   riders don't, many Harley riders do, and I shouldn't, I'm not mad at Harley riders. I like
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.120]   riding Harleys. They're fun, man. If you've never, if you've never pulled out on the highway on a
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.920]   Harley, on a big one, and pulled on the on-ramp and nailed the throttle on a Harley with a good
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.040]   set of pipes, oh, that is an experience. I love doing that. I love doing it. I've done it lots
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.360]   of times. I will do it many more times. So I am not bashing Harleys. I think everybody ought to
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.160]   do that before they die. That is a fun, a fun thing to do. So Harley riders, I'm not mad at you.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.720]   Just simply making an observation here. I'm one of you. I don't own one, but I like to rent one,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.600]   or I like to buy, I like to borrow one anytime I have the chance. By the way, put that on your
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.360]   bucket list. Go and ride a Harley across, across a state or across a country. Especially in America,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.600]   where you have these big, long, flat roads that are built for Harleys, or Harleys are built for
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.960]   them. I would encourage you that you would enjoy that. All right, rabbit trail aside.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:48.000]   So if you compare the cost of him going to his mountain biking events, all he does with the
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.320]   mountain bike event is just toss a bike rack on the back of the car and drive there. He gets the
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.960]   same fuel mileage without it. He doesn't have to buy a bigger vehicle or an extra vehicle or
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.120]   anything like that. But if you drive a Harley, you got to have a pickup truck, which is going to
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.560]   cost him more than the car to get there. You got to have a trailer, maybe, if your car doesn't have
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.960]   a, if you don't have a pickup truck. So you have to buy now an extra thing to sit around. And if
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.320]   you have to buy a trailer, you got to buy an extra trailer that has to be tagged. And maybe in some
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.360]   states insured, I don't know, in my state, it doesn't have to be. But so you got all these
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.720]   extra costs associated with it. And now you've got the Harley, you have to insure the thing,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:36.480]   it's 20 grand. You just got a lot of extra costs, you got to change oil, etc. And so whether you
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.440]   look at it with financial costs that just ripples on and on and on and on and on, by choosing to
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.680]   ride Harleys versus mountain bikes, the health costs, the society costs, just every aspect of it.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.720]   There's so many ways that these hobbies can continue on. Then I think about compounding
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.160]   that with other areas of life. So what about with kids? Well, it's a lot easier, probably,
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:07.360]   to get out with your kids on a mountain bike trail than it is on a motorcycle. Now, I think I would
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.880]   be one who would be willing to ride motorcycle with kids, some people that freaks them out. But
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   I've seen plenty of kids all around the world riding, you know, their whole life on motorcycles,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.840]   and some of them wind up dead, but, you know, it can be done safely. I, it's no big deal for me.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:29.040]   But if you just compare the group togetherness time of the family bike ride, or with your spouse,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.800]   there's a big difference between that versus going off on your Harley.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.120]   So I don't want to pick too much on Harley riders. I just want to say, consider carefully
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.560]   how you can get maximum benefit out of a hobby. I really feel and believe that
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.080]   the appetites that we feed are the things that we wind up being interested in.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.920]   It's really the case. The appetites that we feed are the things that we wind up being interested in.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:05.520]   There is no genetic predisposition of one sport versus another. Why does one male in, I'm going
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.000]   to use some stereotypes here, but why does one, what would be some good male, some good stereotypes,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.920]   why does one male white country boy in rural Florida wind up wanting to drive a large lifted
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:34.960]   four-wheel drive pickup truck? Whereas a white Hispanic male in Miami wants to drive a, what are
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   those things called? The low rider cruiser things that they put, they lower the things down and put
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:48.880]   the shiny paint on them. Whereas one black male in downtown, any city, West Ball, Miami or whatever,
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.040]   wants to drive one of those cars with a new Cadillac or a Cadillac Escalade with 24-inch
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:04.880]   rims on them. Whereas one Asian male wants to drive the important tuner scene, I think is what
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:12.800]   they call that, a souped up Honda Accord racing car with white, small carbon fiber wheels or
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.560]   something like that. Now, I've just probably made everyone upset and made some massive stereotypes,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:27.840]   but those, I should throw in another, why does one other person want to drive a Ferrari?
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.600]   All of these things are appetites that are built in, whether that's through external culture,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:41.440]   external forces or internal forces. These people are not genetically different, really. Race has
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   nothing to do with it. It's environment. The guy out in the country, the country boy from
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.640]   Central Florida doesn't care that much about the low rider classic, low rider pickup truck with
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.680]   the, what are the things that make it go up and down? I don't remember. It's so cool when you see
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   them. Hydraulics, where they make the cars jump up and down. If you've never seen that, that's so
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.160]   fun to see at a car show. Why does the country boy not care about that? It wouldn't fit in with
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.120]   his culture. Now, why does the Ferrari, the BMW crowd, why would they not want to drive a pickup
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.400]   truck? Doesn't fit in with the culture. So, everywhere you have this culture and people,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:28.320]   you choose what you're into. I'm a guy, I like cars. I've always been interested. But what I
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.960]   learned is that over the years, as I fed that desire and fed that appetite in myself, I used to
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.240]   read magazines on four-wheel drive, four-wheel drive magazines, and I just was obsessed with
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.720]   big trucks. And I just fed this appetite, fed this appetite, fed this appetite, fed this appetite.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.520]   And as I fed that appetite in myself, it just grew and grew and grew and grew and grew until it
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.280]   became a lust. And then once it becomes a lust, then it's hard to get away from. Well, there are
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:02.400]   some spiritual components to that issue. And for me, a lot of that was, there was some spiritual
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.360]   release that happened in my heart and I just didn't see any point in most of it anymore.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.440]   But I've also learned to starve some of the appetites. So, I've learned to starve appetites
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.800]   that don't serve me. So, I live in boating country where if you're going to go boating,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.480]   I mean, you got to buy a big boat, you got to go fishing. I don't have any interest in feeding that
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.280]   appetite. It would be a foolish appetite for me to feed at this point in time. If I were to feed
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.160]   that appetite, I could be galling to boats, I could get into interested in all of those things,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.800]   and it would just suck money out of my life and it would suck time out of my life. Or golfing,
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.040]   I live in golf country as well. I've hit a golf ball a few times. I get why people like it,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.760]   but I'm not going to feed that appetite. Because a golf outing, that takes you away from your
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:54.720]   family for six hours at a time, eats up tons of money. Now, can it be useful? All of these hobbies
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.480]   can be useful. Can you go golfing and do lots of business deals on the golf course? Of course you
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.080]   can. That's what it's known for. That's why half the people that do it, do it probably. And then
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:08.320]   you find this satisfaction of hitting that little ball and just knocking it across the way. That's
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.960]   intensely satisfying. But if I'm going to be thoughtful about feeding these appetites and
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.400]   these habits, it's going to be a lot better for me just to consider it in advance and consider
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.680]   what my options are. And I think there'll be much better results accompanying that.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.160]   There's a time and a place, I think, for most hobbies. Boating can be a wonderful way to build
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.640]   family memories. If you have a ski boat out on the lake and that's just the way that your family
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.920]   bonds together, that's great. Do it with purpose. But don't just feed the appetite and let the
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.400]   appetite control you. So to wrap up here, my encouragement is consider the hobbies that you
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.480]   have and the things that you're interested in. And then consider the fact that it's likely that
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:00.400]   most of those things are built into you by your parents, by your surroundings, or by the appetites
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.320]   that you've chosen to feed. I'm not into football, but then again, my parents weren't into football,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.840]   so I didn't have a desire to please my dad. I don't have memories of sitting down and watching
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.160]   football with my dad and that being an invaluable part of my life. If that is for you, cool. That's
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.400]   cool. That's fine. But that's probably what's building the appetite for football in your son
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   rather than anything inherently good or bad about football. I'm not mad at football. Just
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.400]   another example that came to me. Consider carefully the hobbies that you choose,
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.280]   and consider if they're going to serve your goals in every area. Are they going to serve your
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   financial goals or are they going to be a massive sink of money? If there's something you're really
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.760]   interested in, is there a way that you can adjust that interest? Can you adjust from the thrill of
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.560]   the two wheels on the open road on the big motorcycle to the thrill of the two wheels on
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.760]   the narrow single track trail on the dirt bike and get that same thrill with a little bit more
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:08.000]   well-rounded way? And then can you choose hobbies that are going to allow you to experience multiple
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.960]   benefits? Can you choose hobbies that you can be with a good friend? Can you choose hobbies that
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   you can be with your family, with your children, with your spouse? Can you choose hobbies that are
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.840]   going to enhance your health? Can you choose hobbies that...you get the point. Hope this
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.720]   concept was interesting to you. I find it to be a compelling one for me that I think a lot about.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.200]   Haven't read much about this anywhere or really ever heard anybody talked about it, but I'd
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   encourage you to just consider it. If you have good examples of things that you've chosen because
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.440]   of this concept for yourself or for other people, I'd be thrilled to hear about them. Come by the
