[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   If you're public with $100 million in revenue and a 10% growth rate,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.400]   your valuation is not going to be all that great. But guess what? If you're private
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.640]   at $100 million in revenue with a 10% growth rate, it's not like you're better off.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.840]   You're just fooling yourself.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:32.000]   Hey man, good to see you.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.240]   Good to see you, Brad.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.080]   I've been well. How was the eclipse? Didn't you have an eclipse party down there?
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.440]   We did. We had a lot of people out to a location that had a total eclipse and we got super lucky
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.000]   about 30 minutes prior to the total. It had been cloudy and clouds parted, blue sky,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.480]   bright sun on everyone, and then a miraculous event. It's kind of strange to see wrong humans
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.080]   applauding at the sky. Was it religious for you? It really was for a lot of people.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.840]   It felt that, you know, that's a loaded term, but yes, let's use the word spiritual. It felt
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.560]   spiritual. And certainly our forefathers, you know, equated it with something religious.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   Well, I was sorry to miss it. My mother told me, she's 88, and she said she was in tears.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.280]   And, you know, I honestly, I was skiing with my 13-year-old son, and so we missed it. But,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.000]   you know, the rest of my family saw it and they said it was incredible.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360]   Well, lots of tensions in the world, Bill. You know, it was interesting.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.840]   Oh, no.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.880]   I tweeted last week that on the one side, you know, I really see a lot of great things
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.960]   happening in the markets. You know, M&A, I think, is going pretty bonkers right now and
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.000]   liquidity is definitely heating up. You saw the rumors about the Salesforce Informatica deal,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.800]   the Google HubSpot deal. I think I know at least six other deals over a billion dollars
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.440]   that, you know, are actively being courted in the M&A pipeline. So you got that on the one hand.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.000]   On the other hand, you know, we had inflation come in hotter. We have the 10-year kind of
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.120]   back at 4.7%, so up a lot for the year. And we have these geopolitical concerns that are not
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   only tragic, you know, human events, but the backdrop is getting, I think, more challenging
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.640]   for the markets at the same time that the markets have been done pretty well for the year. So that
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.440]   always gets me concerned. You know, I was with a legend investor over the weekend, and I said,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.960]   "What was your net exposure at the beginning of '23?" And he said, "80%." I said, "What about
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.080]   the beginning of '24?" He said, "40%." I said, "What about now?" He said, "Zero." Right? And
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.120]   so whenever you have that sort of, I think, reaction, it always, you know, you have to slow
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.760]   down and think about it. So I definitely think there's a lot of increasing volatility. We're
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.320]   heading into this election here in November that most people aren't even yet thinking about, but
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.360]   we know that's going to lead to a lot more volatility. So I'm feeling, you know, looking
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   at our own portfolios, I'm feeling that tension on the one hand really excited, on the other hand,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   increasingly nervous. Well, as you know, I've often sworn off the notion of macro analysis,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.280]   primarily because I think the best investors of all time have sworn it off. And through immense
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   pressure from you, I've started paying attention to these things, which I don't like because I
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.000]   think it's quite clear that right now risk seems to be on the rise, like just the term risk, you
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   know, across a bunch of different vectors, which is unfortunate. It'd be nice to see it start
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.480]   moving in the other way, but with the election coming and these different conflicts around the
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.000]   world, it's hard to have confidence that something like that could happen. Yeah, no doubt about it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   Well, speaking of the markets, maybe we just jump right into our first topic here, which is,
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.560]   you know, there's been a lot of debate over the course of the past few weeks on the IPO markets,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.120]   the size you need to go public, why we have so few public companies in the U.S. So maybe just
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.080]   kick off with looking at a little FRED data to normalize where we are, right? The number of
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.560]   public companies has gone in the U.S. has gone from 6,500 or so down to about 4,000 over the
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.960]   last 20 years. This is, you know, a cause and concern for many because on the one hand, we have
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.160]   more innovation, we have more startups, and so you would think you would have more public companies,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   not less. And if you look around the world, that's in fact what you see. And what you saw for a long
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.680]   time in the history of public markets in the U.S. up until this recent period. But this is a big
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   number. It's like over 40%. Yes. Like significant. Over probably the most prolific period of
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.160]   innovation in the history of the United States. So now, of course, Jamie Dimon in his annual letter
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.600]   just last week said, yeah, well, that is true. And perhaps concerning the number of private equity
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:34.080]   backed companies had skyrocketed from 1,900 to over 11,000. So, you know, I started, you and I
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.120]   started kicking around like what are some of the, you know, first, you know, are these, is this bad?
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.400]   What are some of the causes of this? And of course, there was a tweet last week about Philippe
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.160]   Lafont, who I think was speaking at the information event in New York, where Philippe said, listen,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.760]   the markets have structurally changed. It used to be you could go public with 50 or 100 million
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   dollars in revenue. And he said, today you have to have a billion dollars in revenue in order to go
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.920]   public. Gokul tweeted something similar at first, looking at some Meritech data. He said, it looks
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.840]   like unless you have 700 million in revenue, then you'll probably underperform in the public markets.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.520]   So here's his tweet there. And then Jam and Ball on our team, you know, responded to that and showed
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.160]   some data that we'll show here that says, no, in fact, if you look at the, you know, the last 10
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:41.600]   years, the average software IPO has been about 185 in median revenue over the last 12 months.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.960]   And it has over 50 percent growth. And so there's this real debate, right? Like how big do you have
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.480]   to be to go public? What is that profile look like? So maybe you could just weigh in a little
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.880]   bit with your thoughts on, you know, that debate online between Philippe and Gokul and Jam and about
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.520]   kind of what's the revenue profile that one needs in order to get out the door today?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.240]   I'll make some very quick comments about what I kind of fundamentally believe in my heart of
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.760]   hearts. But then I think we do need to address some of the realities that are out there. So
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.400]   personally, you know, I think I was on the board of OpenTable when we went public and we did on a
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.040]   10 million dollar quarter. So that's a 40 million run rate, far shy of where we are. And if I bring
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.520]   that up, some will say, well, that was 20 years ago. And it was. I have always believed and I'm
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.240]   not the only one there. There's there's an assortment of other people in our industry
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.920]   that being public is great for companies. It raises the bar in terms of their performance.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.800]   It causes them to to to, I think, achieve more than they would otherwise. So I think it's very
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.840]   positive for our ecosystem. I also think it's positive for the U.S. financial markets, for
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.960]   companies to feel comfortable coming public sooner. You will hear the SEC and others worried
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.480]   that mom and pop investors don't have exposure to these names or don't have exposure to these
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:21.200]   trends or to these companies. And the more that that, you know, they don't go public into their
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.680]   billion dollars, a lot of those gains will be gone. But the people will miss out on this. So
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.520]   I don't think it's healthy. Now that we started with a data point that the number of public
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:40.400]   companies has shrunk. And so, like, there is something going on and we could talk about,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   is there something that could happen that would change that or something that that has caused
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.560]   this to happen? It's interesting to me because I think there is in the boardroom in Silicon
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:57.120]   Valley today, among founders, there is a lot of question like, what do I, what's the profile of
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.040]   the company need to be in order to get public? And, you know, Gokul came back and responded
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.200]   to Jammin in a way that I thought was interesting. He said, well, OK, you don't have to be at 700
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.800]   million in revenue in order to get public, but you have to get to a billion within five years
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.480]   of being public. You know, I called the heads of all the major banks who run the capital market
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.720]   groups because I wanted to get their opinion. Like, you know, they're the ones who actually
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.560]   advise. So what do you all think it needs to look like? And the heads, one of the head of capital
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.280]   market said to me, and I'll just read it here. He said, I feel the bar for size is somewhere between
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.080]   200 million and 300 million of revenues, premium growth rates to peers. So the median growth rate
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.880]   has been around 50 percent and attractive unit economics. I think you need to net out at greater
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.320]   than two billion. So two to two and a half billion in terms of market cap on average that generates
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.480]   an IPO of at least 200 million to 250 million dollars, which has enough float to make it
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.880]   reasonable position for investors. He said to me, the IPO market is slow in volume terms for lack of
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:14.160]   supply, not lack of demand. And I've been making this case that the IPO window is wide open. It's
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.360]   just a matter of price. Certainly Altimeter and Cotu and others would like to buy companies at
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.640]   this size that we think can compound at 50 percent or higher for the next five years. Right. Those
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.600]   are terrific companies to back so long as the point of entry is at a price that reflects what
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.400]   current market multiples is. So, you know, he's kind of taking the other side of the argument
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.040]   saying this is not a demand problem. This isn't that you can't get it into the market. It's a
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.640]   supply problem that's for some reason companies just don't want to come into the market at that
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:53.120]   size. That becomes a circular argument, right? Because if people start saying that, you know,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.800]   externally, oh, you've got to be at one hundred or you've got to be at two hundred, you've got to be
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.040]   at seven hundred. Then people hear that and then they think they can't go. And so, you know, but
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.400]   let's talk about some things that have led to this. You know, on one hand, there's immense
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.440]   capital availability that I had suspected might go away with the market reset, but it clearly didn't
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.840]   or with interest rates going up. And so companies that don't want to be public don't have to be
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.560]   because they can get access to private capital. And at least today, that private capital will
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.120]   let them do secondaries, which solves one of the problems that that historically has brought them
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:42.640]   to the public market. Second, you know, I think structurally those people you call have built
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:49.600]   their Wall Street businesses to cater to these larger companies. And so they prefer to work on
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.120]   a bigger IPO. Way back when there was a group of bankers known as the Four Horsemen that took a
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:03.280]   ton of companies in Silicon Valley public. And I found some data which we can put up, but like
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:10.000]   the vast majority of IPOs are being underwritten by like four or five firms. And one thing that I
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.480]   think would be helpful is if some of the other firms were kind of more dedicated to a smaller IPO
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.640]   where everyone knew they were the go to for that. But that doesn't I don't think anyone's
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.360]   filling that role today. And so those are two big things. And then the third one that could
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.320]   contribute to it is just regulation. And I throw the cost of being public in with regulation. So
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.120]   that could include litigation costs, you know, the insurance you have to buy for your board,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.480]   all those things like is the cost of being public. It's probably two to five million a year
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.000]   just to be public. So let's break those down a little bit because I think, you know, it's a
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.920]   combination of factors, right? So let's just normalize around one. So if you pull up this chart
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.320]   on the Instacart valuation, right, over the course of the last several years. So Instacart was one of
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   these companies that got, you know, really high valuations during the pull forward that we saw
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.680]   in the Zerp COVID period. You know, it hit a valuation of almost $40 billion.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.240]   They went on to raise subsequent rounds of private financing at a lot lower.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:33.360]   They then went public at just around, I think, $6 billion. So here's the IPO performance chart.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.960]   And here's the valuation trajectory of that business over the course of the last several
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.120]   years. So I think one of the obstacles, right? So it's performed incredibly well.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:50.160]   Off of the bottom, it's performed really well since the IPO. But it took a board that had
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.360]   the courage to say, you know, we're going to ignore what the prior valuations were.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.320]   And we're going to focus on getting the company public. Now, in the case of Instacart, I think
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.520]   you had, you know, the branding benefits of when they went public. I think they, you know, had
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.560]   access to, you know, to the cash that they needed to invest and grow in the business.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.400]   But, you know, this seems to undermine this argument that, you know, that companies can't
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:22.560]   do well if they're on the smaller side, you know, post going public. So this is an
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.760]   early indication. But I think that there are a lot of companies in the venture capital pipeline
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:35.280]   bill that look like this, that had these really high marks in '20 and '21. And they need boards
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.040]   and founders and CEOs who have the courage to enter the public market and just accept the new
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.960]   set of marks. And I think this is one of the big psychic or behavioral hurdles to these companies
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   getting out and getting into the public markets. Yeah. Yeah. And look, I mean, there are smaller
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:59.440]   companies, you know, like even in the SPAC space, look at him and hers, or look at SoFi,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:06.400]   Antony Noto. Like they've actually done well over the past six months, like numbers up and to the
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:14.880]   right, stock up and to the right, and much smaller than Instacart. So it is doable. Yeah, I think
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.160]   you're absolutely right that the structural blocker that comes from having a previous private round
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.840]   is always a problem in these situations. And there are ways around that that can be negotiated
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.880]   around. People just need to kind of bite the bullet and take care of that. There's another
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.360]   thing that happens that relates to that, which is there's this presumption that, oh, well, you're
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.840]   not, you know, you're not in a good place to be public. Or the other thing I hear is, oh, imagine
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:53.600]   if you get out and you're too small in your public, how horrible that is. And to me, that's just this
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.800]   indication that there's this ostrich mentality. And what I mean by ostrich mentality is someone
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.080]   willing to stick their hand, head in the dirt, and not see anything and therefore feel better
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:11.920]   about themselves. So where I'm going with that is, if you're public, with 100 million in revenue and
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.680]   a 10% growth rate, your valuation is not going to be all that great. But guess what? If you're
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.800]   private at 100 million in revenue with a 10% growth rate, it's not like you're better off.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:30.720]   You're just fooling yourself, right? In fact, because of a lack of liquidity premium,
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   you're probably worth less than that public company. And structurally, your cap chart's
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.840]   more rigid. And so you have less flexibility. You can't do any acquisition. I mean, there's
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:48.720]   all kinds of reasons why that's a worse place to be. But people have this belief that if I
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:57.040]   can see that price and it says $2.33, oh my God, I'm in this horrible place. People have recovered
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.480]   from that. So I think we've talked about this before. Here's a chart that we put together
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:14.560]   that looks at the valuations, the multiples that companies were coming out in different cohorts
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.120]   by year. So you can see that the multiples of the companies that came out, not surprisingly,
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.320]   in '20 and '21 were really high multiples. And then you can see that the companies that have
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   come out in more recent cohorts are at these much lower multiples. And so I really do think
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   it comes down like this is one of the big hurdles that we have. And we saw this after 2006, 2007.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:47.920]   We had companies funded at really high multiples. I'm thinking even about Zillow or Kayak that were
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.640]   funded then. And they waited a much longer period of time coming out of 2008, 2009 in order to go
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.880]   public because it took them a while to grow above those multiples. And I think that in that case,
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   there were actually ratchets that were in those prior preferred rounds that prevented those
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.600]   companies from coming public. That's not the case in most of these deals that were done in '20 and
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   '21. And so it seems to me when you look at this chart, the multiples that persist in the public
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.320]   market today, they kind of are the multiples. And so a lot of these companies will be forced
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.800]   into the-- they're either going to have to take a down round in the private markets to have access
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.640]   to cash, or they're going to have to access it by way of the public market. It gets back to your
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.560]   point. There's no hiding from whatever fair value is for these businesses. And now we're talking
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.840]   about businesses here that are doing a couple hundred million in revenue that probably still
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.960]   haven't hit profitability, where growth maybe has started to slow below that 50% annual growth rate.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.200]   And I think we have over 1,000 of these companies that are marked over a billion dollars
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.920]   that still have to get work through the system. Now, I'm seeing some more M&A that's happening,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.080]   so larger strategics coming in and buying these companies. I think that will be the answer for
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:15.520]   some. But to me, we're starting to see the IPO pipeline fill with these companies that I think
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.680]   will be on the smaller side, that will have growth rates that are still 30%, 40%, 50%
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:28.240]   superior to public market growth rates. But the valuations will be below, in many cases,
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.680]   their last big round of private financing. And by the way, I hope you're right. I mean,
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:41.200]   I hope we see that. We do have a situation where at least the big guys have been pushed away from
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:48.000]   M&A by regulatory, which is another reason why you need to be more serious about the public option,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.680]   because there are fewer, relative to history, I guess, fewer options on the M&A side.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:02.160]   And this gets back to the point I was thinking about. There's no hiding place in being private.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.360]   And I've often said, the minute you took stock options and started handing them to your employees,
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.480]   you're in the game, you're on the field. And it's a tough game. And the number of people
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.680]   that make it to the next tier always drops exponentially. So we often talk in Silicon
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.440]   Valley about the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, but most people don't make it there.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:35.200]   And so it's a hard, steep climb. And you need to have realism about what's available to you.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.120]   One thing quickly that I wanted to highlight, Gokul referred to this Meritech report. I don't
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.000]   know if that's public. You were able to get a copy that I was able to read. You mentioned
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.960]   unit economics. I think being honest with yourself about your own unit economics is super important.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:59.520]   And at least for SaaS companies, they had a ton of great data in that report that could help one
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.960]   figure out where you are and what your real multiple is very, very likely to be. I don't
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.760]   think it has to be a guessing game. What often happens in Silicon Valley is everyone
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.080]   looks at the top one or two data points and tries to equate themselves with that.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:22.320]   If you look deep in this research report, you shouldn't be doing that. But that does happen.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.160]   And I think the number one thing, if you're a smaller company coming public, is it's about
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.080]   growth. Your unit economics have to be working. So your net dollar retention, if you're a software
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.200]   company, needs to be in a range that shows that your customers love the product, that they're
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   sticky to the product, et cetera. But these companies that have waited a little bit too
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:50.720]   long, Bill, now their growth rate is 20%. They're marginally profitable. They have 200 million in
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.960]   revenue. Unfortunately, that is not a profile that can come public. So this question, this debate,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:02.080]   like what's the magical number? Philippe, is it a billion or is it 700 million? The answer is,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.720]   for those of us who are underwriting these businesses, we're saying, is this a fantastic
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.680]   business with great unit economics that can grow at above market rates for a long period of time
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.640]   and expand margins? If the answer to that is yes, then the public markets are wide open. But guess
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.280]   what? The private markets are wide open for those companies as well. And that brings me to this
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:29.040]   point. I think the biggest thing that has changed over the last 20 years, back to if we think about
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:36.720]   the companies that went public in those early vintages, the Microsofts, the Apples, the Googles,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.240]   the Salesforce, et cetera, what was one commonality, Bill? They needed access to capital
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.720]   to grow, right? And if you look at the private market alternatives for them for capital,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.880]   we didn't have sovereign wealth funds that were writing multi-billion dollar checks at that point
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.240]   in time. We didn't have deep pools of liquidity and growth equity and late stage venture that
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.120]   were writing multi-billion dollar checks at that time. And I think that is a huge difference today.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:11.200]   So I talked to the CEO of a very, very large company that many are speculating as to when
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.520]   they will go public. And they said, we just don't need to go public. Marks are not a consideration
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:24.800]   at all. Employees get liquidity. We have access to capital. There's just no need. And so then
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:31.680]   I read the Jamie Dimon letter. And I'm going to read a part of his letter because he talks about
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:39.600]   us going from 1900 companies to 11,000 companies. And he talks about the liquidity in the private
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.880]   markets, how deep it is for these companies to be able to grow. And he said there are good reasons
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.160]   for private markets and some good outcomes result from them. For example, companies can stay private
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.560]   longer if they wish and raise more and different types of capital without going to the public
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:00.960]   markets. However, taking a wider view, I fear we may be driving companies from the public market.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.480]   The reasons are complex and may include factors such as intensified reporting requirements,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.680]   including investors growing needs for environmental, social, and governance information,
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.120]   higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, cookie cutter board governance,
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.880]   shareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, less capital flexibility,
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.960]   heightened public scrutiny, and relentless pressure on quarterly earnings. So going back
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.000]   to this company, right, if you're one of these companies, you're cash flow positive like this
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.920]   company is, you're growing fast, you have access to all the capital you need. You know, think of,
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.800]   you know, the SpaceXs, the ByteDance, the Databricks, the Stripes of the world,
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   all the companies people are waiting to see when they're going to come public,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.840]   they all fit that profile. They don't need the public markets to provide the liquidity and given
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:01.760]   all of the headwinds that Jamie Dimon talks about, all the reasons not to come public, you know,
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:09.520]   it may very well be that the very best companies choose to stay private, right, which we may even
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.560]   see some adverse selection into the public markets. And it's only the companies that can't
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.720]   rave private financing that try to get into the public markets. What do you think about
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.400]   both this idea that we have deeper and more liquid capital markets, private capital markets,
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:30.240]   and we've created all of these government burdens, litigation burdens for the public company?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.440]   Yeah. Obviously, my first reaction is if he's right, if those are all the reasons,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:43.200]   the vast majority of them relate to this kind of cost of being public. And if you separate his list
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.760]   between what might have changed recently from the past, to say what might have caused this,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:58.480]   these changes recently, you know, it's mostly the litigation, the ESG stuff, the compensation
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:05.200]   flexibility, it's the activist stuff. And, you know, you and I already had a long discussion
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:13.680]   about SBC, but I find that it would take, if the SEC were generally worried about why more
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.920]   companies aren't going public, I think, and I don't even know if they have the wherewithal to
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.120]   do this, because some of them may live at the judge level, but it would take a reevaluation of
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.040]   why the cost of being public or the regulatory burden of being public has grown. And is there
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:36.880]   anything we can do to take it in the other direction? I'm particularly worried about
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.280]   things like derivative lawsuits, where you have a very ambulance chaser mindset, going back to the
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:51.200]   Elon compensation thing, someone with nine shares, who made money can bring that kind of legal case
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:57.120]   against the company where the stock went up. That's really bad. Like, that's not what I would
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:05.520]   call a efficient capital market. I would call that an inefficient, broken capital market. And so I do
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.680]   hope we can look at some of those things. The second thing I would say is, if you're right,
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.840]   and if this becomes some kind of permanent state, I think it's going to be really tough on limited
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:24.800]   partners, because you're going to have a bigger and bigger part of your assets in things that
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.880]   where we really don't know what the price is. And if you have large positions, despite the fact that
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.480]   there may be traits for employees, you probably don't have a trade at the size that would allow
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.240]   you to get. Let's hit on that. That's a super important point, Bill, because we've been talking
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   about why do we have fewer public companies than we had 20 years ago? We've been talking about this
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.960]   for a long time. And people have thought, well, maybe it's just part of the market cycle.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:00.320]   I'm evolving my own thinking to say, this is permanent and this is structural. Because the
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.640]   government regulatory burdens are at least semi-permanent. And the markets have responded
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:13.360]   by the private capital markets stepping in and providing the liquidity where companies can get
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.520]   the cash they need, can get the secondaries for employees they need, without having to go public,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:24.480]   at least the best companies. So if you think about that, you made a good point. So if you're
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.080]   an employee of SpaceX, or you're an employee of Stripe, or you're an employee of ByteDance or
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.920]   these other companies, you probably have quarterly or biannual liquidity events.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.360]   They raise a secondary tender, and those employees can sell up to a certain amount within those
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:49.040]   tenders, right? But in those same companies, you have massive LP gains that are locked up,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:56.240]   right? And it's very difficult. You can't sell easily a billion or a $2 billion position in
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:03.040]   ByteDance or sell a multibillion dollar position. So all of the endowments, foundations, pension
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.840]   funds, they're in a different position than they've been in the past. They perhaps have--
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.760]   even if you did, it would be a trade by appointment, pink sheet kind of,
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:20.080]   likely with a banker grabbing 5% or 10% along the way. It wouldn't be an efficient transfer.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:28.720]   Right. So that to me is if you said, what's the ultimate cause of these companies to go public?
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.640]   The ultimate cause would seem to me that at some point, the LPs, the people who put up the first
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.880]   money into the business need to get liquidity, right? But two structural changes that we've seen
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.720]   there, right? One is it just seems the best companies will stay private longer, right? And
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:54.080]   we've seen this trend over the course of the last 15 years. Although I will remind you that Zuckerberg
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.600]   said he should have gone public two years sooner than he did. Right. And think about how early he
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   went public relative to the late stage private companies that exist today. So I would say I do
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:15.120]   see that these companies will eventually come public because they need to get liquidity back
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.800]   to those LPs who provided that first capital, unless the private market again responds and
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:28.400]   provides some vehicle for these companies to come public. It's interesting. By the way,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.200]   another negative impact of this. I mean, I think if you're right, I think it's structurally
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:42.480]   disadvantageous to the venture capital world at large or as an asset class in an industry,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.880]   because one of the things that happens if the best ones aren't doing it is there's no pressure
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:57.360]   on the next level to do it. And it kind of trickles on down. Or just the common belief,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   as you've said, comes to be that, oh, well, you're not eligible for that. Right. And so
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:10.560]   then you're going to have even more companies that kind of rot in place. I hate to use such
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:19.520]   a dramatic term, but they're just going to sit there and exist and probably dilute
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.840]   5%, 7%, 8% a year on new equity and never get closer to the finish.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.600]   Well, remember, the companies that can stay private, Bill, are only the very best companies.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.640]   The vast majority of these companies don't get to cash flow break even, or they just barely
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:42.800]   get there. They need access to the cash in order to keep funding the business.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.480]   They can get recapped. They can get rolled up in PE. There's a lot of things that can happen
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   that don't necessarily equate to gains for VCs and LPs.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.640]   Well, that's true. And I do think, like I said, we're going to see a lot-- I think this was the
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.360]   point of Gokul's tweet, actually. He's saying, hey, listen, a lot of these software companies
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.080]   no longer have the profile that allows them to ever get public. And so they're going to have
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.320]   to sell to private equity or do something else. They need to get real about their situation.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:20.240]   And we are unquestionably in a place where, because of overfunding over the past four
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:25.040]   or five years-- I remember the one slide where there were more private unicorns than public
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.320]   unicorns-- there's a lot to clean up. And so unquestionably, that's true.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.000]   The last thing I would mention on this topic is-- I mentioned it quickly earlier-- but there are a
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.640]   number of people-- and you'll hear people talk about-- that are worried that mom and pop or the
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.560]   average investor doesn't have exposure to these names. And if you're right-- and this is more
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:55.840]   permanent-- rather than back up and fix the regulatory costs that put us in this place,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:02.080]   they'll try and fix it from the other side. They'll try and create ETFs for privates. Or
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:10.240]   they'll try and mandate that firms like yourself take on individual investors. And I think that's
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:17.600]   a complete rat's nest. We don't have to go into why. But it's not fixing the real problem, which
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.800]   is having a functional capital market that's open and inviting to more companies.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.960]   It's an interesting debate and one that is also evolving. So this is the question of,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:36.640]   does the little guy get access to the best companies in technology, for example?
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.400]   And if those companies are in the public markets, then clearly all retail investors can buy those
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.560]   companies. But it's very difficult for a retail investor to get access, perhaps, to a SpaceX or
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.320]   a Databricks, a Stripe, et cetera, the best of the private companies.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:00.880]   But when you look at the evolution, Bill, of who is providing the ultimate capital,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:09.920]   increasingly pension funds, which represent firefighters and teachers and police officers
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.680]   in the city of New York or the city of San Francisco or the state of Texas,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:20.720]   increasingly they're LPs in these growth equity funds, the later stage funds like ours.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:29.840]   So they are gaining access, the retail investor, by virtue of being a participant in that 401(k)
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.960]   or that pension. So I do think that there's probably more retail exposure to these late
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:43.200]   stage big companies than appears at first blush. But I will also agree with you, it's much less
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:49.920]   egalitarian than being able to open a Robinhood account and have access to those companies.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:56.480]   Yes. Yeah. And my history of reading and watching the regulators, that argument won't be good
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.720]   enough for them. And they'll try and create what is, in essence, a new public market. Because when
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.920]   you want to have a market where everyone can trade and it's all fair, you need the rules that exist
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.480]   in the public market. So trying to have your cake and eat it too doesn't really work.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.880]   Well, a couple other points that I would make. One is, as we saw in 2021, there were a lot of
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.200]   companies that were just walking under the assumption that private market capital would
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:30.480]   always be available to them. And so you don't go public because you say, oh, Masa will always be
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.640]   there. SoftBank will always be there to provide my next round of financing. And I think what
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.000]   people are starting to see as they burn through the capital that they raised during this period
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   is that private markets are less liquid. Granted, the liquidity has gotten way deeper
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.160]   for the best companies. But for the average company in the private markets, that is not the
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:58.240]   same story. The negative reflexivity, the drawdown, the tightening up of those private markets can
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:05.680]   have draconian consequences on these businesses. So again, I think that there is, for the vast
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:13.600]   majority of companies, I still, I would conclude by saying I'm in kind of the jam and go-go camp
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.920]   that if you're a software company, you have $250 million in revenue, you're growing at 50%,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.520]   you're approaching break-even, you think you're going to compound at 30%, 40%, 50% for the next
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.720]   five years, expand those margins. The public markets are a perfectly good place to innovate,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:35.280]   to grow, to build your brand, to gain credibility. I do think we're going to see some acceleration.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.920]   All those heads of capital markets that I talked to, they all told me their pipelines are filling.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.160]   I know this because my team is spending more time on roadshows.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.120]   I think there's also some off-the-beaten-path companies with pretty good numbers that are
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:58.720]   going to come as well. Ironically, not in Silicon Valley, because I think these means and rules and
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.560]   this kind of negativity about how big you have to be, I think those things echo much louder
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:10.640]   in Silicon Valley than they do externally. One thing that we have done, and I've encouraged
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:18.800]   LPs like endowments to think about, is we used to have these two buckets, venture and public,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:26.240]   when I talk to technology investors. Then they would have everything in their venture bucket,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:33.920]   all the way from a series A, all the way through Stripe or ByteDance, which obviously makes no
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.080]   sense. Those companies are over $50 billion in enterprise value, all the way up. What we talk
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.200]   about internally is there's a venture market. Think of that as a market with less than $100
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:52.080]   million in revenues, less than $1 billion in EV. There's a lot of mortality risk associated with
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:58.160]   these businesses. There's a lot of volatility associated with them. Then for companies that
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:03.520]   have a couple hundred million dollars in revenue and are well over that billion dollars in EV,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.720]   we call those quasi-public. There's more liquidity associated with those businesses.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.960]   There's less mortality associated with those businesses. These are oftentimes companies
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:19.840]   that could be public and are choosing to stay private. It has a whole different set of investors
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   that invest in those companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, foundations and endowments,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.800]   obviously big growth equity funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds that
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:36.400]   are multistage. Then, of course, you have the public markets. They also have different
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:44.720]   characteristics in that the VC bucket, obviously, the VC chooses you. The quasi-public bucket,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:50.640]   that's not everybody can participate, but there are 10 to 50 firms probably that show up around
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.400]   those party rounds and have an opportunity to participate. Then, of course, everybody can
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.720]   participate in the public market. I think that at different points of the market cycle, we'll see
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.880]   different appetites for going public, but these underlying dynamics, I do think the structural
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.320]   changes are here to stay and that there will be a category of excellent companies that can choose
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:20.160]   to stay private a lot longer. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. I would push back on
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:29.120]   that a little bit. I think history will show and unfortunately, we may all be in our graves by the
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:37.680]   time, the window you need to evaluate this, but that staying private forever has consequences.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:46.720]   Unfortunately, the way it'll show up is some people will have kept some private marks in their
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.040]   very large positions and very large portfolios for a very long time and then they'll be corrected all
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:04.480]   at once. The learning window on that is so long that there's not a self-correcting mechanism,
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.760]   not in the near term for sure. Well, I would say the single greatest
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:16.800]   input to valuation and technology is growth. Number two is margin. The danger in technology,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.280]   which is a highly disruptive industry, is that you stay private, your LPs and your investors
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.920]   don't get liquid. During that period of time where you have ultimate confidence,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.840]   a structural change occurs in the market dynamics such that your growth rate goes down. Maybe you
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.560]   have to spend a lot more money to defend your market position. The multiple for the business
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:45.120]   goes down a lot. You and I remember this. There were companies in 2010, this is really pre-mobile
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.280]   taking off in the search industry that had vertical search engines that had really high multiples
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:58.240]   that were demolished by the transition to mobile. When that happens, those things represent
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.120]   permanent capital loss to the investors. I do think that getting people liquid,
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:09.200]   performing and competing in the public markets, it's certainly a terrific choice.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.960]   I think Jamie Dimon's right. We've got way more liquid private markets and the government
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:21.760]   has really mucked up through all of these regulations, allowing this excess litigation.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.160]   It has mucked up and made it less attractive to be a public company today, but let's move on.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:33.600]   Let's move on. The next thing we're going to talk about, I want to kick it off. We're going to talk
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:43.280]   about autonomous vehicles and whether or not and how they would compete with ride-sharing services.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.200]   The thing that I think is bringing this topic to the forefront, obviously you and I have talked
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:56.240]   about this for I don't know how long now, many, many, many, many, many years as both being earlier
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   investors in Uber. I think the thing that's bringing it to the forefront are twofold.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:09.600]   One, Tesla has had some breakthroughs with FSD-12 and they've already announced they're
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:15.440]   going to start talking about their RoboTaxi initiative in a more public way. Then Waymo
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.880]   is open and available in more cities and people are riding in them and so they're having experiences.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.040]   I'll just stop there as a kickoff and let you go next.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.920]   Great. I was up in the city last night. I was shocked by the number of Waymos I saw.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:42.480]   I saw them everywhere. It reminded me, none of them had drivers. None of them had anybody in
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.120]   the front seat. They had riders in the car. I think in the city of San Francisco and these
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   other cities, that was just mind-boggling when you saw it the first time. There was at one point,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.720]   I had three cars around me and they were all Waymos.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.080]   People have eclipse-like experiences when they get into these things.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.120]   Listen, I think part of the setup here is it's been a tough week for Tesla. They're
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.200]   laying off 14,000 people or about 10% of their workforce. Car demand is clearly weak. That's
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.960]   on the one hand. On the other hand, there's some transformative things going on that you and I've
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:25.520]   talked about. These imitation models are clearly better than expected at scale. They're having a
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:31.600]   larger rollout of FSD. Now, I think they pushed FSD out to everybody who has the technical
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.240]   capability on their Tesla in order to receive it. They've talked about dramatically lowering the
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:43.440]   cost of FSD to 99 bucks a month. I think they've hit over a billion miles driven now with FSD.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.200]   By our estimates, they're adding over a billion miles a month. I think that their confidence that
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:55.920]   their data advantage is increasing dramatically is going up. There's some speculation out there,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.320]   "Oh, Elon's throwing the long ball on RoboTaxi and all this." I don't believe any of that.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:10.480]   I think that the conditions that get the company re-excited about RoboTaxi is that FSD is going way,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:15.600]   way better than they expected it would 18 months ago in terms of the technology, Bill, in terms
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.360]   of the technology that they have available. They've reprioritized RoboTaxi. They said,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:27.760]   "We're going to move it to the top of our priority list." I think Elon announced that they're going
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:33.920]   to have an announcement in August. Now, of course, immediately after he does that, analysts dig in,
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.480]   and they called the regulators in a couple of different states, and the regulators said,
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.880]   "We haven't heard from Tesla." Of course, there were tweets that went out and said that a couple
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.920]   of states' regulators had not heard from this. I don't think that really means anything because,
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:55.520]   of course, they could launch this in any city on the planet, right? From Abu Dhabi to South
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:01.040]   America. Certainly, there's a city on the planet that wants to be first to have Tesla RoboTaxis.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:10.000]   Go ahead. I thought, because I know you and I've talked about this, there are a number of topics
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.480]   that I think are important to consider and discuss that live beyond the technical feasibility. I know
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.880]   there are people that would say, "Okay, even if they're at four nines, they're not enough. It's
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:27.120]   got to be six nines," or, "Will it work in snow?" and all that kind of thing. I would say for this
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:34.960]   discussion, let's put that aside. Let's assume Waymo and Tesla have both achieved the quality it
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.800]   takes for the vehicle to move around by itself. What are the other things that these companies
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.960]   need to think about in order to have a successful robo fleet, if you will? Well, I'm going to touch
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:54.640]   on the technical thing real briefly, and then go to the other elements required to have a successful
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:04.080]   robo fleet. If you think about the way Waymo, you and I did this breakdown on FSD-12. We said one of
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.440]   the downsides of Waymo and Cruze is they have these deterministic models, right? That they have
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.720]   hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and they all are a rule about how they expect the car to
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:24.640]   behave. Well, it turns out in ride-sharing, cities, airports impose a lot of specific rules on the
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.920]   ride-sharing companies. They tell them where you can drop off, where you can pick up, how those
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:36.240]   cars have to behave in certain circumstances. That would seem to lend itself to a deterministic model
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.960]   where you could just write a line of code that says, "Here's what you do at an airport in San
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:48.160]   Francisco." One of the things I had a question on is just, can an imitation model that's imitating
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:56.480]   five-star drivers, can it easily have these deterministic components to it? I talked to some
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:05.440]   friends who are working on this, and they said, "Think of it like once the user inputs, 'I'm going
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:11.760]   from San Francisco to the San Francisco airport,' that they would drop that information into the
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.960]   prompt, right? That would tune the general model so that they actually have been thinking about
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:23.200]   how to solve that technical problem," because it certainly was one of the things on my mind.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:29.360]   But okay, let's assume that they both have this cracked and that this becomes standard and
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.200]   ubiquitous that these cars can drive around. Well, one of the reasons you invested in Uber is
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:42.480]   that as Uber grows, the power of the network effects gets even bigger, right? And so they
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:49.840]   have more riders, which leads to more drivers, which reduces wait times, which creates better
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.760]   experience, which leads to more riders. And you have this virtuous cycle that's created by that.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:01.440]   Obviously, that's made it very difficult on Uber's competitors, and they're achieving the natural
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.560]   market leadership, economics, and share position that you would expect vis-a-vis Lyft,
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:16.400]   particularly now that access to capital to Lyft got a lot harder. So we can start by just asking
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:22.720]   the question, "How do we think Tesla will go to market with its RoboTaxi?" In the case of Waymo,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:30.320]   they've chosen to go to market, both directly, you can book it on a Waymo app, or in Phoenix,
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.800]   for example, you can book it on the Uber app. So you can book your Waymo on the Uber app.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:41.120]   And so in that case, Waymo recognizes it's a very small fleet, right? In that case,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:47.520]   Waymo owns the fleet, so huge cost of ownership there for Waymo. They want to drive utility of
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:53.760]   that fleet, so they're using Uber as third-party demand generation into that, and they have an
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:00.000]   economic revenue-sharing relationship between those two companies. Now, of course, that's not
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.360]   the way I would think that Elon might approach it, right? He has the potential to be much bigger.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.680]   Tesla is a much better-known brand. There are millions of people with the app already on their
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:18.320]   phone. So I think most of the people I talk to, Bill, suggest in the first instance that he'll
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.920]   build an owned and operated fleet, right, where he may have outside financiers or rental car
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:29.520]   companies that take ownership of the car, but insofar as booking that fleet, you would go
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:36.480]   through the Tesla app. So, you know, we could talk about it. I throw it back to you. Let's just say
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:45.760]   that that's the approach that they take. What are Tesla's chances of breaking down the network
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:52.720]   effects that Uber currently has on rideshare demand? Well, I think you've hit on a key point,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:59.600]   which is I think you have to separate Tesla from everybody else. Waymo, and I don't know if Cruz
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.360]   and Aurora still aspire to compete with Waymo or not, but they all have this very high-tech
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.520]   infrastructure with LiDAR that we've talked about, and they're all here today working on a model
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.720]   where they own and operate all the cars, which we should get into in a little bit because
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:27.840]   financially I think that's a complete disaster. Tesla has the benefit that they can utilize,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:34.240]   theoretically, the cars that are already owned by their customers and not have to front the capital
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:43.760]   for each and every vehicle. If you look at the data we already have, Cruz was losing, what,
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:50.880]   $3 billion? Aurora's public lost $2 billion two years ago, a billion last year, and virtually
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:57.520]   no revenue. I have zero reason to believe, zero reason to believe, and if anyone wants to share
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.560]   data with us to correct this, that Waymo's financials don't look exactly like both of
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:09.440]   the ones. What do you think Waymo's worth today? They did a, we can look up, I mean,
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.040]   it's a private company. No, I'm asking you. All we can look up is what it traded for last time.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.640]   Well, even Aurora's trading at, what, $4 billion here with no revenue and a billion dollars a year
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:26.800]   of losses, so there's Wall Street speculating that the IP has value. So keep going on Waymo.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:35.600]   Yeah, but here's the thing. I think it really comes down to supply and demand. There is a
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:46.480]   beautiful emergent quality of the Uber model where supply and demand are matched and it's enhanced
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:54.800]   with price through surcharges, but there are plenty of people who want to make incremental
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   money that know when to get on the road. I have a chart which we can put up which shows at one
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:10.720]   point in time the weekly pattern of ride sharing, and it's remarkably non-linear, right? It peaks
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:17.920]   in the morning, it peaks in the evening, it really peaks on Friday and Saturday, and Waymo or anyone
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:24.320]   like them with an owned fleet has, here's a huge conundrum. Are you going to build the fleet to
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:30.880]   average or peak? And by the way, you lose whatever your answer is. If you build it to average,
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:35.440]   you're not going to be able to serve your customers during the peak at all. They're only going to be
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   disappointed. And if you build it to peak, you're going to have a bunch of very, very, very expensive
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.160]   CapEx sitting around doing nothing most of the time. Okay, so I think this is the most critical
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:52.800]   point, right? Because this is the same challenge that Amazon faced, which led to the creation of
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:53:01.360]   AWS. This is the same challenge that most businesses face, which is they have very spiky
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:06.720]   demand periods. And if you want to be an incredible customer experience, you have to have something
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:12.560]   that can regulate to those higher periods of demand. Like you said with Uber, they have a
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.680]   natural thing. They can just charge a little bit of peak pricing. They got more people who get out
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.640]   of their houses, drive their cars, pick you up, wait times don't go up that much. And they benefit
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:28.160]   from that. And as the network expands, it gets even better. Well, and you remember, it goes back
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.360]   to what was that word when Airbnb first came out? It was asset sharing. It was a different word that
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:40.880]   was used. But there's a huge amount of cars, especially in the US, they're sitting mostly
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:49.280]   on it. And so Uber gets to take advantage of that and utilize that CapEx. And Tesla may have a
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.720]   similar advantage just because they have enough customers. Someone trying to build a completely
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:00.400]   separate fleet, I just don't think it works. And I would encourage anyone that believes in it or
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:08.000]   anyone that's a, let's call them a Waymo advocate, let's build a public Google Sheet of the 20 year
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.280]   financial statements for this thing. And let's put it out there in the public. You're going to need
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.200]   hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. And I don't know how you answer this peak versus
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:24.000]   average question. I don't know how you do it. So let's talk about some of the ways that might
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:32.240]   happen. As a Tesla owner, if I had the opportunity to put my Tesla in a pool and allow it to be
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:37.600]   pulled out during peak periods of time for ride share, I'd have a problem with that because I
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:44.480]   need my car during those periods of time. Well, it's very likely, here's another way of saying
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:51.040]   what you're saying, which is it's very likely that the average Tesla owner's usage map is
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:57.600]   similar to the Uber map that we just put on the screen. Of course, this is my point. So here would
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:04.720]   be a straw man. Tesla launches with an owned and operated fleet to prove the model, to start
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:11.520]   building the customer affinity with the product, the customer trust. Which would unquestionably
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:19.840]   work because there's so many Tesla fans that would want to do it just to be supportive of the team.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.560]   And by the way, it's a great product. It feels great. You probably already have a Tesla,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:31.040]   so you feel good about FSD. So my hunch is they launch it on... You might even launch it at first
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:37.600]   with only allowing Tesla owners or something like that. Oh, interesting. It's almost like a benefit
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:46.080]   of ownership. So then I think what they do is, my hunch is that they will open it up and partner
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:52.960]   with Uber. I think Uber would like that. I think Tesla would like it. And here's my argument for
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:56:02.160]   that. The only way you solve the peak demand problem, Bill, is that you have to basically
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:09.280]   have high utilization at lower periods of demand. You have to reduce the delta between your trough
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:15.360]   and your peak. And the way you do that is you pull in the Uber demand when your demand is lower.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:21.760]   And so an example of that would be, if you think about in the city of New York,
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.320]   McDonald's has an app. You can go on the McDonald's app and you can order a burger,
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:34.480]   right? Or you can go on the Uber Eats app or the DoorDash app and order a burger. And so
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:40.720]   McDonald's recognizes that they want to try to flatten that demand out over the course of the day.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:47.600]   And so they can yield manage that by having both a 3P and a 1P strategy. So it seems to me that the
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:54.800]   only way you really crack this is have a 3P and 1P strategy. And the upside to that, in addition,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:03.760]   is that now you have a flywheel of Uber drivers potentially building some mini fleets of their
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.880]   own. You could imagine somebody who says, hey, this is pretty accretive. We saw this with black
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.160]   cars, I know, in the early days, where you had one operator that may have two or three or four
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:19.440]   black cars. You could imagine somebody who says, listen, I can make money by arbing this system
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:30.160]   and by having multiple Teslas in that fleet. So I think they probably launch it on a standalone
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:35.120]   basis. They get a lot of excitement and a lot of customer love for it. But my sense is, by the time
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:40.640]   you scale this, it probably does have to be an open system. We'll see. Yeah. And I mean, that's
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:46.880]   clearly up to the powers that be at Tesla to make that decision. The two companies have partnered
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:53.760]   to date already. They have quite a number of initiatives, including like free charging for
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.160]   people that buy them and put them on. So there's a there's a close partnership already. But,
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   you know, as as this plays out, we may see, you know, reasons why they may not want to.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:10.640]   Can we talk a little bit just about the unit economics, you know, of these different businesses?
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:16.560]   Yeah, there's one thing I want to bring up specifically that that'll be interesting to
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:23.680]   see how it plays out. And that's insurance. And so last time I had specific knowledge,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:30.000]   and it's been four or five years, but I doubt it changed that much. The cost per mile of insurance
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.440]   for Uber in the U.S. is dramatically higher than the rest of the world. And if you look at just
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.200]   the cost of consumer car insurance, the same thing's true, way higher in the U.S., which gets
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:50.240]   to another problem with regulatory costs that our government should try and fix. But anyway,
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:59.680]   it strikes me and I would be worried about this as an investor. It strikes me that the
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:09.280]   that a particularly aggressive litigator lawyer would chomp at the bit to get in front of a jury
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:17.680]   on a robot killing a human and maybe even create more litigation costs and a higher cost of
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:24.400]   insurance for a robo-taxi than a driver. Now, I know how people, our listeners, are going to react
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:30.160]   to that. They are convinced in their heart of hearts and in their brain that these are safer
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:39.760]   than human drivers. And I am saying this even with that potentially being true. We may have
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:48.320]   just such a broken litigation situation in the U.S. that the actual cost of underwriting the
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:55.280]   insurance for a robo-taxi may be higher than a real car. And time will tell. And as we know,
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:01.040]   Tesla's already brought some of their insurance operations internally. And if they're willing
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.200]   to underwrite it themselves and fight it themselves, maybe that's something they'll do
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.280]   as a part of this rolling out. I got to take a tangent here for a second and then I'll come back
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.400]   to these unit economics. You know, I was with a certain investor, a group of investors in the
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.200]   Midwest, let's just say, over the weekend that are very big investors in the insurance business. And
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.120]   I asked him the question, I said, what's up with car insurance being up 22% in the CPI on a year
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.320]   over year basis? I mean, it was crazy. Car insurance up 22%. And he said, here's how it
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   works, Bill. In 20 and 21, we have very predictable and very steady number of miles driven in this
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.400]   country on a year over year basis. And the accident rate remains very steady. So the cost
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:51.360]   of our auto insurance has largely been pretty flat, growing with GDP. What happened in 20 and 21,
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:59.760]   the number of miles driven fell a lot. And so it fell so much that those companies were prone to
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.040]   over earn, right? Because there were just, there's less chance of an accident with fewer people
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.840]   driving, or at least that was the assumption. But what turned out to be true is that the miles that
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:17.040]   came off the road for some reason were safe miles and the accidents per mile driven actually spiked
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.480]   a lot. So much so that the insurance companies lost a lot of money during this period of time.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.280]   So they went to the state regulators who control insurance pricing and they said, hey, we got to
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.960]   raise the price of insurance because we're losing money. Now, remember, auto insurance companies
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:39.040]   try to price the insurance to make about, you know, 3, 4, 5% on the insurance and the rest of
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:45.520]   the money they make is on the float. Okay. But in those years, they were losing 5 to 10% on the
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:51.680]   insurance, right? So the companies were actually losing money even with the float. How long do you
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.640]   think it takes the California state regulator to pass along an insurance increase, right? You have
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.160]   to threaten them that you're going to leave the state and all this other stuff, and then eventually
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.280]   they do it. So now they passed on this insurance increase and it just kicked in, which is what you
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:12.240]   saw in the CPI, right? And ironically, and not surprisingly, the patterns of driving have now
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.040]   returned to pre-COVID levels. So we went from a period where the auto insurance were not charging
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.440]   enough because they had to beg the state regulators and they were slow, and now they're charging too
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.720]   much. But set that aside for a second. Let's come back to the unit economic. And by the way, I think
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.280]   this cost, this is a lot of guesswork. I apologize. People should treat it as such. But I think in the
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:41.840]   Uber case in the US, about 5% of gross revenue goes to insurance. Yeah. So it's an expensive
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:47.440]   input. And we took a crack. Okay. So let's just say at the high level, most people think that
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.840]   taking the driver out of the Uber will lead to an explosion in profit margins because it represents
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:03.040]   70% or 75% of the cost of the ride. But we actually took a crack at these unit economics. And what I
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.400]   think that fails to understand is a couple of things. Number one, if you just break this down
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:16.080]   per car, we estimate that there's about $140,000 of revenue per car driven on the Uber network. Now,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.480]   of course, this is blended across tons of different markets, tons of different cars, etc.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:27.840]   So $140,000 of GBV. When you do that in self-driving, we think it goes down to about $100,000. Why?
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.840]   Well, you have actually more rides in the self-driven car, right? But it actually comes
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.240]   in at a lower cost because you put so many cars on the road that the charge to the consumer gets
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.880]   shared back with the consumer, right? Margins come down as you have more competition because you have
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:53.040]   more cars on the road. Next up, the revenue per car. Well, of course, you take out 70% of the cost,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:01.360]   the driver cost, on the driver-driven car. So at a revenue level, we think that if you were
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:09.280]   comparing apples for apples, in the case of the one with a driver, they make about $40,000 a car.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.560]   Without the driver, they would make about $90,000 per car. This is just revenue.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:21.120]   So about double the revenue. But the costs are way higher in the full self-driving case.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.400]   Obviously, first up is you have to pay for the car, right? There are massive costs associated
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   with that. Maintaining the car, the insurance on the car, all the things the driver currently does
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:37.520]   now is dropped upon-- Well, yeah, and just on that first one, because
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:45.920]   I can go buy a two-year-old used car for $25,000, $30,000 and get on the road,
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:55.440]   and then you add in the cost to the human. You need the fully autonomous car to be really cheap
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:01.520]   in order-- because if it-- and I don't think anyone thinks the current Waymo when you were
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.120]   surrounded by the other day is anywhere close to even $100,000. No, those cars cost probably
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:14.720]   $150,000. It's not viable. So that car would need to get down towards this $30,000 number for that
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   disruption to matter. If it's in the $45,000, $50,000, and it's an alternative to $30,000 plus
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:25.920]   a driver, you have no-- But again, where Tesla has an advantage, they probably can put a car
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.320]   on the road at those lower price points. So when we shake it all out, and I'm happy to--
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.920]   But by the way, there's other things the driver does. I mean, the driver maintains the car.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:42.960]   So once again, this is in the Tesla case, if it's not an owned fleet, it's a customer-owned fleet,
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.280]   they can clean it, and that'll just be a cost to putting your car out on the road.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:54.480]   But in the case of a Waymo, like that car has to come back to headquarters at some point.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.080]   Someone's got to get in it. Someone's got to clean it. There's eyes that are going to be needed.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.480]   So there's going to be a customer service staff that's going to have a camera because you're
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:09.680]   going to have to settle disputes. You're going to have to deal with customers. And the human does
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.640]   that in the case. So there are going to be other costs that exist. So the point is, you have to
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:20.560]   take the 70% that you save on the driver, and then you have to add all these new costs that you're
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:28.720]   going to incur. We still think that the margin goes up from, let's call it, 7% of gross bookings
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.240]   to something like 12% or 14% of gross bookings, even taking into account all of that bill.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.040]   But that's what we're all trying to do. We're all trying to build a forecast and understand,
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.320]   you know, assuming that this could work, assuming that regulators pass it, assuming you could build
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.840]   the $25,000 or $30,000 car, assuming that you could enter into a commercial relationship with
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:55.920]   Uber and yield manage the peak and, you know, demand. All of that is to say, there are a lot
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.000]   of needles that have to be threaded in order for this to work at scale. And I think if it does work
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.520]   at scale, I don't, you know, obviously, talking our book a little bit here, I don't think this
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:13.360]   is much of a threat to Uber. In fact, I think if it works for Tesla, I think there's an opportunity
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:22.080]   for both companies. And by the way, like another way I'd restate what you just said, which is,
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.160]   it's not going to be financially disruptive at the beginning or in the middle. It might
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:34.960]   theoretically be financially disruptive at the very end. But there's way too much capital that
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:40.640]   and the price of the car has to come down. There's too much that has to happen. There's no way for
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:46.080]   someone's not going to come out tomorrow with a robo fleet and underpriced Uber.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.920]   Well, and let's put one final point here. Remember this deal that Tesla entered into
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.960]   with Hertz where Hertz bought a bunch of Teslas? It turned out that the resale value on those cars
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:02.160]   was dramatically less than they had forecast. And the CEO lost his job over this. I think
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   the write down for Hertz was like a billion dollars over this mis-forecast. So if you're
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.840]   in the business of buying and maintaining that fleet on behalf of Tesla, you're doing so with
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.680]   full knowledge that all of this is hard to forecast. So you're going to bake into your
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.880]   model a huge margin of safety, right? So that you're not going to have the problem that Hertz
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:31.760]   just ran into. I would say based on everything I know and we're not in the boardroom with these
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:39.360]   guys, but like letting the customers own the Teslas that own the fleet is a better alternative.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:45.520]   Much, much, much, much better. And I will say this, the fact that we're even talking about a
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:53.600]   robo taxi fleet shows you the incredible progress that Tesla has made. And what we talked about on
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.160]   the show a few weeks ago, the month to month improvement in the model, the data that they're
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:04.320]   collecting. And just the anecdote I shared from last night, I am more convinced than I ever have
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:11.520]   that we're going to see tons of cars on the roads with no drivers in the years ahead. You and I are
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.720]   just speculating as to how the business model might come together. But by the way, one last
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.440]   thing, I'm so sorry. I do think there's an argument that you might see this be prolific
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.840]   in a different country soon. Of course. Of course. Both China and India have much higher road deaths
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:37.840]   per mile. So you can see the government wanting it to happen. China being more autocratic could
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.000]   just wave their hand and change insurance rates, mandates. They could just make it a reality.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.840]   Whereas we in the U.S. with the way our litigation and regulation work are very unlikely to clear the
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.360]   decks and make way for something. You know, I also think, you know, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.240]   Tesla and Uber coexist in a ton of markets around the world. And there are a lot of markets that,
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.520]   frankly, are more innovative than the United States, have less regulatory headwinds. I could
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.280]   see this happening in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. I could see this happening in Singapore. I could see this
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.880]   happening in South America. I could see this happening in Mexico. There are a ton of jurisdictions
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.720]   where I expect this, unfortunately, before I expected in the U.S., you know, at scale.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.360]   All right. Before we wrap up, let's check in on markets since we talked last. What are
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.560]   you seeing out there, Brad? What do we need to be worried about?
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.720]   You know, if you telescope way out, we're about ready to enter earnings season, right? Next week,
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:50.720]   we have Tesla report. We have Facebook reports, Microsoft reports, Google reports. So, you know,
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.480]   thinking about the setup heading into earnings. If you telescope way out, the S&P and the Nasdaq
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:05.680]   are up about 6% year-to-date, Bill. The small caps are down about 3%. And it really comes down
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.440]   to a lot of those, the companies that are up in tech have beat their numbers, right? NVIDIA's
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.680]   beat their numbers. Microsoft's beat their numbers. Google's beat their numbers. And the companies
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:21.600]   that are down, Tesla and Apple have largely disappointed. You know, but against this
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.520]   backdrop of the Nasdaq being up 6%, we've had a huge move in the 10-year, right? We've talked
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.800]   ad nauseum over the course of the last couple of years about how interest rates are the economic
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:39.120]   law of gravity for the financial markets. And since the start of the year, the cost of that 10-year
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:47.200]   is up 20%. We've gone from 3.9 to now 4.7 today. So, just all else being equal, right? You would
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:55.440]   expect that growth company multiples would be down 10% to 15% because the 10-year is up a lot.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:02.080]   So, I think the thing that's making a bunch of people nervous is usually you have this inverse
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:07.680]   relationship. As rates are going up, you know, that's a headwind for tech. You might expect
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:14.240]   that the Nasdaq would actually be down a little bit on the year in relationship to the cost
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:22.080]   of the 10-year going up. So, if you dig in a little bit to, you know, to these businesses and
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:28.880]   say, "What has to happen in order for these stocks to work next week?" It really comes down to this.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.640]   The margin in 2023, all you had to do is be less bad, right? It was that reversion to the mean
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:40.080]   trade. But now, the only way your stock's going up is you got to beat numbers, right? Your numbers
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.600]   have to get revised us upward. And if you miss numbers, it'll be brutal to the downside. You
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.040]   know, the team's made a chart on, an interesting chart on cloud acceleration. So, what might be
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   driving that acceleration? We've talked a lot on the show about AI, but check out this chart.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.760]   So, you can see for hyperscalers, you can see that COVID bump. So, this is absolute
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.600]   dollars that were added to the three large clouds over the course of the past several years.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.360]   So, you see how that really bumped up during COVID and ZURP. And then, you can see the belt
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.920]   tightening period as interest rates went up, people got a lot more nervous about the economy.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.920]   These are CapEx numbers?
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.280]   Right. No, these are the absolute dollars of revenue that were added to those companies,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.760]   right? So, think of this as year-over-year revenue growth. And so, we dipped. It started to go up
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.200]   over the course of the last couple quarters. And now, consensus is forecasting that it continues
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:46.720]   to go up, you know, above trendline. So, those companies are going to have to deliver. That's AWS,
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.840]   that's Microsoft, that's Google. And, you know, our belief is that they will. We think they will
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.760]   beat those forecasts because we do see that real acceleration coming out of AI. Now, look at this
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:05.360]   chart. This is that same chart, Bill, for Datadog, Mongo, Confluent, Elastic. Think of it as the data
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.800]   infrastructure companies. They got a much bigger benefit during COVID, but they also had a much
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.560]   bigger pullback. Now, look here what the consensus is forecasting. Unlike for the hyperscalers,
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.360]   the consensus is saying, "No, we don't buy that they're going to re-accelerate and get back above
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.960]   trendline." We think they still have, you know, they have some challenges ahead, and they're not
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.160]   going to get back up to those COVID levels of absolute revenue dollars that were added on a
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.040]   year-over-year basis. So, I think that's an interesting divergence, you know, that you'll
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:43.200]   have to keep your eye on when Snowflake and Mongo report. We actually think a bunch of those
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.720]   companies are seeing the flow through out of AI as more enterprises are moving more of their data
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:55.440]   into the cloud, but there's clearly tension in the market about that. You know, one other thing that
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:04.880]   is really interesting to me is we universally see companies holding the line on expenses,
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.640]   right? And so, think of this as, you know, we had real questions, was the age of efficiency
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.520]   going to be, you know, a moment in time, or were companies going to continue to do that?
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.000]   I was talking to the CEO of a major company the other day, and, you know, with tens of thousands
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.360]   of employees. And he said, over the course of the next three years, we'll grow our top line 50%,
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:34.960]   and we'll reduce our personnel costs by 10% to 20%, right? That's extraordinary. Like,
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.960]   I don't think we've had a moment like the moment we have today in terms of margin expansion,
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:47.920]   right, in any time frame that I can remember where it was voluntary. It's not because we're
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:53.120]   in a recession, it's not, but it's because companies really do see the opportunity,
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:59.680]   both they had some, you know, they have room to cut because they got excessive in 20 and 21,
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.800]   and because they now have these tools, co-pilots, soon to be co-workers in engineering,
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.800]   that enable them to be more productive, more efficient in engineering,
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:16.160]   and also allow them to be much more efficient. And that includes Slack and Zoom and things that
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:22.400]   allow people to have more employees outside of the Bay Area. I mean, every one of these CEOs
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:28.640]   I talked to are intentionally trying to get headcount out of the Bay Area.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:35.120]   Which, in response to our SBC pod that we did, I had a, you know, a CEO of a major
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:42.320]   company call me and say, "Hey, we're rebalancing how we're thinking about SBC, you know, across
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.960]   the business." And I said, "Doesn't that make you nervous that you'll lose your best engineers,
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:53.280]   you know, if the total cost of SBC comes down?" And he said, "No, because we don't need as many
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.880]   engineers. The labor market for engineers is softening. It's easy for us to keep and retain
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   the best talent. And so now is exactly the time to get our comp plan reset for the next five to
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   seven years." So, Net, I would say that I'm really excited about both the reaccelerating
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:18.400]   top line for some of these businesses. Again, this is very unique to tech. You know, I see
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.000]   other pockets in the economy, like we just talked about autos. I mean, it's a tough story out there.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.520]   Higher interest rates, less consumer demand, people have burnt through their STEMI checks,
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.040]   they have less savings. And so I think it is a tale of these two worlds. But I think one of the
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.240]   key drivers over the course of the next several years in tech is going to be these expanding
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:45.600]   margins caused by, you know, the tool set that they're investing in around AI.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:52.640]   Well, here's the good news. You've now set the stage for earnings. So when we get back together
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.760]   in two weeks and this stuff starts coming through, we'll have a lens and a framework
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.320]   for what to talk about. And I'll get a report card.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.480]   Okay, fair enough. Great seeing you, man. A lot of fun.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.840]   Good to see you. Take care. Bye-bye.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:21.760]   As a reminder to everybody, just our opinions, not investment advice.
