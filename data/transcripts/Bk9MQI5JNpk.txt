[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.260]   Pastor John, do the rather strong words in Romans 13, verses 1 through 7, indicate
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.760]   that civil disobedience is always wrong for the Christian? I don't think Romans
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.240]   13, the first paragraph there, rules out all civil disobedience. Let me read just a
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.840]   piece of it, because it sounds like it does, and I admit it's a significant
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.000]   exegetical problem. So it says, "Let every person be subject to the governing
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.040]   authorities, for there is no authority except from God." So, be subject because
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.200]   authorities are from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   Therefore, whoever resists the authorities resists what God has
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. So there's the
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.680]   basic statement. We ought to be submissive to government because
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.440]   government is of God, and it's a gift of God. Sometimes people who get their back
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.960]   up real quick and want to plead for civil disobedience before they think too
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.040]   much forget that anarchy and mob rule are horrible, horrible things. I remember
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.080]   watching the movie "Gandhi" and those couple of scenes where the mobs got out
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.960]   of hand and turned on a man, and the terror that came over me just watching
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.480]   the power of a totally lawless mob. You are utterly helpless. And so government,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.160]   in keeping a cap on the evil of the world and restraining evil and bringing
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.320]   some kind of order, is a great gift in a world of fallenness. So I just want to
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.760]   say yes to God's gift of government in a world of sin. But we all know, World War
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.240]   Two, Nazism, Pol Pot, all kinds of illustrations from history, that
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.040]   government can go wrong, which makes verse 3 and 4 look really strange. And I
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.760]   think this is a clue to what Paul is up to. "Rulers are not a terror to good but
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.120]   to bad." And we read that and we say, "Paul! How can you possibly say that? You're being
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.080]   thrown in jail every other week, and Jesus was crucified by governments. What
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.320]   do you mean they're not a terror to good conduct but to bad?" And then he
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.600]   goes on and says, "You'll receive their approval if you do what is good." In verse
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.160]   4, they are God's servant for good, and they are an avenger to carry out God's
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.480]   wrath on the wrongdoer. And that's the argument for why we should be submissive.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.520]   And we say, "Well, if the argument is so weak, how does the conclusion follow?" I
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.480]   think Paul, if he heard us say that, he would say, "Listen, here's what I'm doing.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.200]   Number one, Caesar is going to read this, and I want to make sure that the ruling
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.760]   authorities in Rome know that Christians are not anarchists. We are basically
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.560]   law-abiding citizens, and we believe that he has his position by God. That's the
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.320]   first thing. And the second thing, I think he wants Christians to say, "Don't get
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.560]   your back up so easily, because being wronged by a government sends nobody to
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.760]   hell, but being rebellious and angry and bitter and spiteful does send people to
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.880]   hell, and so it's a much greater evil for you to be rebellious than for the
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.400]   government to mistreat you. A much greater evil for you, that is." Now, if you step
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:56.980]   back from Romans 13 and say, "Are there any appropriate acts of civil
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.160]   disobedience?" There are. I mean, Acts 5, 29, I think it is, where it says, "We must
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.720]   obey God rather than men. The Apostles must preach, because the authorities have
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   told them they shouldn't." And then we have the example of the
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.440]   the midwives in Exodus, where they wouldn't kill the baby boys, and we have
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.240]   Daniel, who right after they make the law that you can't pray, he goes up and
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.440]   kneels down in front of a window and gets thrown into a lion's den, and
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.360]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego won't bow down to the big golden statue, and
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.160]   Esther is told by Mordecai, "You've got to go to the king, because we're all going to
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   be killed if you don't go to the king." And she writes back and says, "You can't
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.960]   go to the king. It's against the law if you go to the king unbidden." And he
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.280]   writes back and says, "We're going to die anyway." And she says, "Okay, if I perish, I
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.200]   perish." And she breaks the law. He mercifully raises the golden scepter, and
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.480]   she's spared, but she was willing to risk breaking the law for the sake of
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   her people. And so I think the principle is this. Citizens to governments,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   children to parents, wives to husbands, church members to elders, all of those
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   are called to have an appropriate, submissive spirit and to follow
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.960]   leadership. None of those is considered to be absolute. All of them have the
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.200]   Lordship of Jesus riding over the Lordship of the Superior, and thus
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.440]   defining the limits of the Lordship of the Superior. Thank you, Pastor John,
