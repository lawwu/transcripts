[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.960]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.220]   Today, my guest is Jocko Willink.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580]   Jocko Willink is a retired Navy SEAL,
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.560]   an author of numerous important books
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.680]   on leadership and team dynamics,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.500]   and the host of the Jocko Podcast.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.920]   During his 20-year career with the US Navy,
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.720]   Jocko served with SEAL Team 3
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.120]   as Commander of Task Unit Bruiser in Ramadi, Iraq,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.640]   and elsewhere in the Middle East,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420]   as well as deployments in Asia and Europe.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.180]   After retiring from the Navy,
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.200]   Jocko used his experience and knowledge
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.520]   gleaned from his time in the SEAL teams
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.880]   as a way to develop tools that anybody can use
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.840]   to develop their leadership skills,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.600]   both for leading themselves and for leading others.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.640]   That took the form of several important books,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.080]   the first of which was published in 2015
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.200]   and is entitled "Extreme Ownership,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.920]   How US Navy SEALs Lead and Win."
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.560]   He has also authored several books for kids
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.040]   about leadership, personal development,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.440]   and how to navigate various aspects of life.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.040]   I've read both "Extreme Ownership"
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.900]   and "The Way of the Warrior Kid,"
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.360]   and I found them to be immensely useful
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.320]   in terms of actionable information
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.400]   and understanding of oneself
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.140]   and different kinds of relationships,
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.080]   both in and out of the workplace.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.980]   Typically, guests on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.100]   are scientists and/or clinicians.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.760]   It was some time ago that I was a guest
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.000]   on the Jocko Podcast,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and during the course of our conversation on his podcast,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.100]   we quickly realized that many of the science-based tools
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.140]   that my laboratory has focused on
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.740]   and that I've used over the years
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.780]   and shared on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.300]   had direct overlap and parallel with many of the tools
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.220]   that Jocko and other members of the SEAL teams
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.440]   had arrived at independently,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.820]   that is, without knowledge of the underlying science.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.980]   And in fact, he had many more tools
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.520]   that he had incorporated during his years in the SEAL teams,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.320]   as well as in business leadership,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.620]   in family, and elsewhere in life,
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.320]   that I quickly realized
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.360]   it would be an enormously valuable conversation
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.300]   to have him on this podcast
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.140]   in order to share those tools with the general public.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.160]   During today's episode,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.320]   we discussed numerous tools
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.640]   that Jocko has taught and used over the years
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.320]   in a number of different contexts,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.960]   including tools for generating more physical energy
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.420]   and for generating more focus and cognitive energy,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.180]   and for navigating sticking points,
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.240]   that is, how to deal with lack of motivation,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.820]   how to deal with difficult relationships in the workplace
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.660]   and elsewhere,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.780]   and perhaps most importantly,
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.060]   how to think about and navigate the self.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.600]   In fact, we spend quite a bit of time
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.580]   talking about this notion of the self
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.500]   and one's self-identity
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.100]   and how self-identity plays into our ability
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.480]   to engage in actions of specific types
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000]   consistently over time,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.500]   where it can hold us back,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.640]   how to gain better perspective,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.480]   and how to help others gain better perspective
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.900]   so that we can work better with them and them with us.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.740]   We also go deep into the likely scientific mechanisms
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.400]   underlying why the tools that Jocko teaches and uses
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.900]   are so effective.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.900]   In fact, one thing that you'll immediately notice
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.580]   is that Jocko was writing things down
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.180]   and I was writing things down throughout the conversation,
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.520]   and that just reflects the fact
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.420]   that he's not just an immensely powerful teacher,
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.980]   he's also a practitioner and an avid learner.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.860]   He's always seeking knowledge.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.360]   So we kick back and forth our ideas about what likely does
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.020]   and does not underlie different tools and techniques,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.300]   focusing, of course, mostly on what works
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.200]   in the practical sense in the world.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.640]   What I can assure you is that by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.620]   thanks to Jocko's immense generosity and curiosity,
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.140]   you will come away with a large number of tools
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.040]   and much richer understanding of how to navigate
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.540]   and enhance mental health, physical health,
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.020]   and performance in all aspects of life.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.780]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.500]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.820]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.660]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.260]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.180]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.420]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.980]   Maui Nui is venison that is by far the most nutrient dense
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.620]   and delicious red meat commercially available.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.300]   Maui Nui spent nearly a decade
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.760]   building a USDA certified wild harvesting system
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.900]   to help balance invasive deer populations
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.320]   on the island of Maui.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.500]   The solution they built turns the proliferation
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.660]   of an otherwise invasive species
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.380]   into a wide range of nutrient dense products,
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.260]   from fresh butcher cuts and organ meats
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.720]   to bone broth, jerky, and even pet treats.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.020]   The quality and nutrient value Maui Nui meets
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.260]   is extraordinary.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.040]   For instance, their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.140]   of protein per 100 calories.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.300]   As I've talked about with guests
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.420]   and in solo episodes of this podcast,
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.900]   getting adequate protein intake
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.260]   and in particular high quality protein intake
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.820]   is extremely important.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.380]   Current research suggests that most people
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.660]   should be getting about one gram per pound of body weight
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.340]   of quality protein per day.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.620]   And Maui Nui meats are of the absolute highest quality
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.460]   in terms of the amino acid profile
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.000]   and other nutrients contained in their venison.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.860]   If you would like to try Maui Nui venison,
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.020]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.940]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.700]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.060]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.180]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.180]   I've discussed many times before on this podcast
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.580]   about the key importance of temperature
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.280]   in regulating the quality of your sleep.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.160]   Put simply, in order to fall asleep
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.220]   and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.660]   your body temperature has to drop
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.380]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.700]   And waking up conversely involves your body temperature
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.140]   increasing by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.220]   Now, people vary in their core body temperature
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.900]   and whether or not they tend to run hot or cold
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.960]   throughout the night,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.500]   but with Eight Sleep mattresses and mattress covers,
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.160]   you can literally program in the exact temperature
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.860]   that you want to sleep in.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.880]   And that allows you to fall deeply asleep,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.820]   go into slow wave sleep and REM sleep,
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.260]   that is rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.340]   in the exact sequence that you need to
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.300]   in order to have the best quality sleep.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.700]   And it will even track your sleep for you.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.880]   I've been sleeping with an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.220]   on my mattress for about eight months now,
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.920]   and it is incredible.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.600]   My sleep was already pretty good and now it is fantastic.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.180]   And I feel so much more alert and focused.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.520]   My mood is far better throughout the day.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.420]   I thought I was optimized and with Eight Sleep,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.680]   now I realize I had a lot more room to improve my sleep
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.100]   and my daytime wakefulness.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.260]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.440]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.400]   and check out their pod pro cover

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.220]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.660]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.820]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.500]   That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.420]   and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.900]   but it has no sugar.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.620]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.300]   about the key role of hydration and electrolytes
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.620]   for nerve cell function, neuron function,
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.420]   as well as the function of all the cells
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.340]   and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.020]   If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium present
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.300]   in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.340]   and all our bodily systems can be optimized.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.180]   If the electrolytes are not present
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.980]   and if hydration is low,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.940]   we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.320]   our mood is off, hormone systems go off,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.380]   our ability to get into physical action,
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.060]   to engage in endurance and strength
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.660]   and all sorts of other things is diminished.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.260]   So with Element, you can make sure
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.900]   that you're staying on top of your hydration
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.740]   and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.100]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.540]   that's lmnt.com/huberman
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.380]   and you'll get a free Element sample pack
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.340]   with your purchase.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.420]   And right now, Element has two special flavors
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.580]   for the holidays, chocolate caramel and mint chocolate.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.500]   By the way, both of those taste extremely good,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.900]   cold and even better, I find, heated up.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.700]   Believe it or not, you can have them as kind of a tea,
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.940]   they're delicious and all of their flavors are delicious.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.260]   For the ones that you drink typically cold,
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.620]   I like the raspberry flavor, the watermelon flavor
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.340]   and frankly, I like the citrus flavor as well,
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.180]   they're all delicious.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.600]   So again, if you want to try Element,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.140]   you can go to elementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.880]   The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.120]   with Momentus Supplements.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.440]   To find the supplements we discussed
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.660]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.300]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.620]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.220]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.420]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.520]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.140]   And now for my discussion with Jocko Willink.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.080]   Jocko Willink, welcome.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.100]   - Thanks for having me, man.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.740]   - I'm super excited and super happy to have you here.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.880]   - I'm glad to be here.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.940]   I know that you and I did five and a half hours
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.420]   on my podcast, so schedule is clear, let's go.
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.340]   - Let's go.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.400]   And actually, and people will see the Jocko Go drinks.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.680]   This is not some sort of promotional by me,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.860]   but these are the energy drinks I drink.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.840]   So this could be called the Bring Your Own Go podcast.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.480]   It is the energy drink I drink.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.420]   And no, I'm not told to promote that
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.260]   or paid to promote that.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.180]   It's just the one that I drink.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.600]   So there you go.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.260]   No pun intended.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260]   I was just saying to our producer a moment ago
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.960]   that rarely do I sit down and do a podcast
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.900]   with somebody that's skilled in podcasting.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.300]   Lex Friedman would be the only person
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.560]   that I've had on this podcast, I believe,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   who's also a podcaster.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.080]   Since you're a podcaster and many other things,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.900]   I confess I'm a little bit intimidated.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.680]   - Well, it's a weird thing to actually call a skill
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.640]   because it's something that I just kind of started doing.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.300]   It's something that you just kind of started doing.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.980]   It's something that Lex just kind of started doing.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.720]   And I never practiced it.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.640]   I didn't sit down before my first podcast
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.600]   and think about how I should deliver things.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.480]   I just kind of did it.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.320]   So maybe it's just luck more than skill.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.320]   - Well, you and I actually go back further
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.360]   than that conversation that we had on your podcast.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.000]   I think it might've been 2014, 2015,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.480]   and you were on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.680]   And the time I was living with my girlfriend,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.600]   we had moved from San Diego to the Bay Area.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.000]   We were living in this little tiny apartment
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.320]   in a basement in Oakland, trying to save up to buy a place
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.740]   or rent a place that was decent to live in.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.560]   And we both knew a lot of team guys.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.680]   She knew more team guys than I did in San Diego.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.200]   I dated a few just to be direct, great woman.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.720]   Those guys were cool to me, mostly.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.680]   And I remember when I saw the photo on the top card
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.080]   for Tim's podcast, it was your face.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.020]   I said, "Do you know this guy from San Diego?"
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.400]   And she goes, "Nope, but if you had to draw a Navy Seal,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   that's what you'd draw."
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.540]   So I think for a lot of people,
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.800]   you embody their notion of a number of different things.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.200]   Some of which you talk about,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.600]   but some of which when you open up a bit
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.280]   and really get specific about work in the military
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.920]   and work in daily life and what it is to be you,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.360]   but really what it is to be a human being,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.480]   some important contradictions also emerge, right?
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.320]   Obviously, discipline is a theme
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.840]   that people associate with you, right?
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.140]   In my view, and I think in the view of a lot of people,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.200]   you embody discipline.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.100]   So today I definitely want to talk about routines,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.320]   but also mindsets, but also things that you do
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.640]   and ways that you approach things
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   that might not contradict, but not be so obvious to people,
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.240]   might be a little bit counterintuitive.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.200]   And in addition to that,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.720]   you have a lot of different aspects to your life
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.800]   in addition to running businesses, you're a family man,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.440]   you have children and married a long time.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.740]   And so you have a lot of knowledge
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.860]   from different domains of life.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.240]   So with your permission,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.460]   I'd like to dive into all of them over the next 26 hours.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.720]   - Let's dive.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.400]   - Great.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.100]   I'm fascinated by this idea of sense of self.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.800]   I feel like all of us can look back to a time early in life
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.340]   when we first had some experience,
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.940]   could be in art class, could be fishing, could be sport,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.620]   doesn't really matter what the exact experience was,
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.200]   but where we first realized
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.180]   that there are really cool things in the world,
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.920]   like something that turned us on at the level of excitement,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.100]   or maybe scared us or something like that.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.220]   Do you have any recollection of such an event?
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.320]   Maybe not the first one,
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.720]   but you ever remember hearing or seeing something
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.580]   as a young kid, and maybe you could tell us how young
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.120]   and just thinking like, yeah, more of that, please.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.600]   - A lot of times when people ask questions
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.860]   along this line of like, when was there a moment, right?
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.020]   When was there a moment that you realized discipline?
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.920]   Or when was there a moment you realized leadership?
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.420]   Or when was there a moment you realized detachment?
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.160]   Kind of like the question here,
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.060]   when was there a moment you realized,
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.940]   for lack of a better way of saying it, I'm a person, right?
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.840]   I'm a person with my own thoughts
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.780]   and I can make things happen.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.180]   And for me, all those answers are usually fairly gradual.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.820]   There's like a little thing that indicates you get a clue
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.640]   and then you move a little bit further down that road,
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.560]   then you get another clue
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.060]   and you move a little bit further down that road
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.300]   and you get another clue.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:17.660]   So that's what I would say for me, life was like,
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.160]   when I was a little kid,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.840]   I was kind of slowly discovering
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.600]   that I was a person, I was a human.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.080]   I remember my mom took me shopping.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.200]   I was probably about 10 years old
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.800]   and I needed to get pants for school.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.460]   And my mom took me shopping.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.920]   And when I went into the store,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.580]   there was a girl that was,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.760]   I don't know what they're called in a store,
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.400]   a retail sales girl.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.680]   She was probably about 16.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.360]   And I started chatting her up, right?
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.680]   And I kind of recognize it a little bit,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.880]   but I sort of didn't too.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.460]   And I just was chatting to this girl
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.720]   and I was making her laugh.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.460]   I was having a good time with the whole thing
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.880]   and putting on the pants and spinning around
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.120]   and she was laughing.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.160]   And I remember when we left the store with the pants
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.240]   and my mom was sort of talking to me about the fact that,
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.120]   what were you trying to do to that girl?
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.480]   And I was thinking to myself,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.700]   well, I kind of liked that girl, she was pretty.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.240]   And I don't know why that popped into my head,
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.540]   but I just remember thinking,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.280]   hey man, there's a whole world out there
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.880]   and let's go make it happen.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   - Yeah, it's a great story
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.200]   'cause I think it really speaks to this thing
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.040]   that you mentioned,
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.440]   which is that when we first start to realize
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.460]   we have a sense of self,
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.960]   it has something to do with cause and effect on the world.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.500]   We can have an impact in some way
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.200]   on things outside of us, outside of our home.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.880]   Lately, I've been reading a lot of psychology
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.360]   and I've been listening to some of your content
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.460]   and I definitely want to talk to you about
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.420]   a study that you covered related to these.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.360]   It's a brutal experiment with these kids
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.360]   that either had stutter or didn't have stutter.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.760]   I want to get into that a little bit later,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.440]   but what we do and how we treat people
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.600]   and how we receive feedback and give feedback
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.500]   has a big impact.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.940]   But I think some of that happens just in our own relationship
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.140]   to things in the world.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.300]   The old Hungarian psychologists I'm learning
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.620]   had this idea of two kinds of people.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.820]   They literally thought there were two kinds of people.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.020]   There are generators and projectors
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.500]   and generators are people that are just
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.280]   from a very young age,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.160]   they realize they can impact other people,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.300]   positively, negatively,
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.980]   and they want to create things in the world.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.420]   They want to generate stuff.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.100]   And I go, wow, I can actually build stuff
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.180]   and break stuff and blow stuff up maybe,
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   but also help things.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.940]   And then there are these projectors
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.220]   that like to just kind of reflect on what they see.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.260]   And they made the really important point, I think,
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.340]   that it's not that generators are good
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.180]   and projectors are bad.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.500]   The world needs both,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.220]   that they really work in a kind of symbiotic way.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.060]   But your story captures the essence
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.320]   of what it is to be a generator,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.100]   which is that by doing certain things,
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.860]   you can have an impact and it feeds back to you
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.260]   and it's likely that they receive something
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.100]   from it as well.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.420]   - Yeah, and where this all came to fruition,
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.140]   as I now piece together,
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.620]   as you're talking through this stuff,
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.580]   look, when I joined the military,
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.180]   you join the military and you get a blank slate.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.340]   So no one cares where you came from.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.700]   No one cares what you did.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.960]   You were the captain of the football team,
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.900]   captain of the soccer team.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.740]   No one cares.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.780]   No one cares what your grades were.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.740]   No one cares what you got on the SATs or the,
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.040]   and no one cares about anything.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.540]   You're a blank slate.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.360]   And then with that blank slate, it is,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.820]   hey, if you do this thing,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.380]   if you perform this task and you perform it well,
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.140]   you will get recognition.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.060]   You will get,
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:55.020]   you will hopefully get more control over your own destiny,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.020]   which is the ultimate in compensation for human beings.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.780]   To have more control over your own destiny
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.880]   is the ultimate compensation.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.580]   You know, you and I were talking before we hit record,
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.980]   like you can have all the money in the world,
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.480]   but if you don't control what you're doing every day,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.880]   or at least you don't control most of what you're doing,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   then it's not worth it.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.040]   The reason people try and make money
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.400]   is so they can have more autonomy in their life.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.240]   And so in the military, it becomes very clear,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.920]   and it became very clear to me very quickly
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   that if I performed well,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.840]   I actually got a lot more freedom with what I did.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.200]   Even in bootcamp, you know,
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   if you pass an inspection in bootcamp,
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.440]   you don't have to redo your locker
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.900]   or you don't have to make your bed again
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.880]   because you did it right the first time.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.060]   And so you have an extra 15 minutes.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.900]   And so for me, really, that's when I started to realize,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.840]   oh, what I'm doing right now is gonna impact
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.480]   not only what's gonna happen to me in the next hour,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.000]   but in the next two years, three years, five years.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.660]   And I think that's the biggest mess that we have
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.720]   when we're growing up.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.560]   And I know you had your challenges and tribulations
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.340]   as you were growing up because you didn't realize,
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.880]   oh, what I'm doing right now
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.680]   is gonna affect where I'm gonna be in the future.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.820]   And it didn't happen until you were out of high school
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.180]   and you went to junior college and you're like,
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.020]   oh, wait a second.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.920]   I can actually put my life together in a positive way.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.040]   When you're 14, you're thinking,
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.300]   hey, what am I gonna do tomorrow?
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.260]   That's basically future operations
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.540]   are what am I gonna do tomorrow?
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.720]   - I was like, where am I gonna get the Slurpee?
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.100]   Which curves am I gonna hit?
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.580]   Skateboarding and where are we gonna play video games tonight
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.860]   or what girls are we gonna hang out with?
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.220]   That was kind of the mindset at 14.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.980]   - Yeah, and then at some point you learned and so did I,
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.720]   oh, the actions that I take now
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.520]   are either gonna positively impact my future
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.340]   or they're gonna negatively impact my future.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.440]   And the more I focused on doing things
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.140]   that are gonna positively impact my future,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.320]   the better my life became.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.040]   And I think that's a very huge lesson to learn
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.300]   that I know I didn't figure out for quite some time.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.380]   - Yeah, the idea of investments and withdrawals
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.380]   or understanding that early in life
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.020]   in terms of health behaviors and intellectual behaviors.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.960]   And your point about the military
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.800]   is a really interesting one.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.300]   I never thought about the military that way
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.140]   that there's this blank slate when you get in there.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.680]   And before we started, we were talking a little bit
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.960]   about the kinds of mindsets and people
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.900]   that the military attracts.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.140]   And I'd love for you to elaborate on that again.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.100]   You mentioned something interesting, this notion of garrison,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.040]   interesting word in its own right.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.060]   What kind of people do you think the military attracts?
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.660]   And then within the military,
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.580]   do you start to see some kind of predictable bifurcations
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.580]   where certain people go down one track
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.100]   and other people go down another?
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.780]   I have a few friends from the SEAL teams, as we both know.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.700]   And I've heard sometimes about the distinction
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.220]   between officers and enlisted guys, this kind of thing.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.460]   But maybe the question I'm asking is more across the board
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.940]   for all of military and really for people listening,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.260]   whether or not they are interested in military or not
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.940]   for their own life.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.500]   I think there's an interesting lesson in this idea
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.700]   of who is attracted to the military.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.780]   Is it like people who want to instill order on themselves
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.160]   or is it people who want to instill order
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.060]   on other people or both?
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.860]   - Yeah, there's a really good book.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.340]   And I ended up doing about four podcasts on this book,
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.180]   which is called "The Psychology of Military Incompetence."
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.020]   And when I first saw that title-
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.860]   - What an amazing title.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.780]   - I know, and when I first saw that title,
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.580]   I thought to myself, oh, you know, this is some academic
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.300]   that's going to look at the military and bash it.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.580]   And, but I did a little research and it turned out
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.700]   that the guy that had written the book,
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.100]   and I can't think of his name right now,
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.900]   he was a guy that had served in World War II, was wounded.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.260]   I mean, this guy understood what he was talking about.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.060]   And it's really an obvious concept
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.880]   once you think about it.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.040]   And the basic premise is this,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.620]   the military, when you look at it from the outside,
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.920]   it's this orderly place.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.700]   It's a place where everything has a place.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.040]   It's a place where if you have a certain rank
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.020]   on your shoulder, you will command respect
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.100]   and people have to listen to you.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.380]   That's what it looks like.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.140]   So it's an attractive place for people
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.820]   that have an authoritarian mindset,
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.720]   for people that want to just, hey,
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.040]   don't question what I'm saying,
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.340]   just shut up and do what I tell you to do.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.500]   There's people that love that.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.900]   There's people that want to live like that.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.980]   You've worked for them, I've worked for them.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.100]   We've experienced those types of people
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.700]   throughout our lives.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.600]   That authoritarian mindset that just want to bark orders
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.680]   and have people listen to them.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.180]   And so when they, when those people are 14 years old
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.920]   or 16 years old or 18 years old and they look
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.360]   at the military and they see a uniform
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.840]   and they see people saluting
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.880]   and they see orders being carried out
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.800]   and they think that's where I'm gonna go
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.200]   and I can get the respect that I deserve.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.380]   And the military certainly attracts people like that.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   And those people that have that highly dedicated,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.060]   disciplined and orderly mindset can do well
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.500]   inside the military, especially in garrison.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   And I had to, again, we were talking about this earlier,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.860]   the word garrison, I don't think there's a civilian
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.580]   equivalent to this word, but it basically means
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.200]   the non-combat situation.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.900]   So when you're out on the parade field,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.300]   when you're going through schooling,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.060]   where there's no combat involved, when you're marching,
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.260]   like those kinds of things, we call that garrison.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.540]   It's in the rear, it's not in combat.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.240]   And the people with an authoritarian mindset
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.640]   actually do pretty well in garrison situations, why?
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.380]   Because things are orderly and you can predict
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.620]   what's going to happen and you do get a certain issue
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.100]   of gear and that gear is gonna be delivered on time
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.880]   and you're gonna shoot this number of rounds
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.220]   down at the range and everything is going to go
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.540]   according to plan, that's what garrison is.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.200]   And so those people join the military,
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.120]   they're attracted to that and they end up doing well
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.080]   in peace time.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.560]   Now, unfortunately for them, combat is a lot different.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.860]   Nothing goes the way it's supposed to go.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.160]   The bullets don't get delivered on time.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.020]   The enemy has a vote on the way things are going to unfold
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.680]   and you end up in combat in being
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.420]   in very chaotic situations.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.320]   So the type of person that thrives in combat
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.820]   has a more open mind, has a more flexible mind,
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.260]   is paying more attention to the input
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.660]   that they're receiving.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.380]   As opposed to someone with authoritarian mindset,
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.460]   they don't listen to anybody else.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.240]   They make up their own mind, they bark orders.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.460]   With someone that has a more open mindset,
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.000]   they're listening, they're taking input,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.780]   they're evolving their plan.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.120]   And those type of people excel in a combat situation.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.980]   Now, unfortunately, and this is sort of the stereotype too,
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.980]   you take that dog of war and you put him back
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.420]   into a garrison environment, he doesn't do well, right?
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.960]   He's not showing up on time for the inspection.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.780]   He doesn't have his, he didn't get his hair cut.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.140]   He doesn't have his weapon clean
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.200]   the way it's supposed to be cleaned
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.180]   'cause he's got his weapon ready for combat,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.760]   not ready for inspection.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.100]   And so you get this,
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.360]   there are these two different types of people.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.260]   And of course, with those two different types of people,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.060]   there's degrees going one direction or the other.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.860]   But what you hope for is someone that can play the game
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.660]   on the garrison side.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.300]   And yet when it comes time to go into combat,
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.780]   they can also open their mind, be flexible, be creative.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.940]   And that's what you really want is you want someone
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.740]   that is very good at solving problems.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.020]   And to do that, you need to have a creative open mind
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.780]   to figure out how we're gonna deal with something.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.840]   So I think that's a stereotype.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.680]   The stereotype is that everyone in the military
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.080]   is sort of robotic and falling into the hierarchy
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.540]   and we bark orders and people follow orders.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.120]   And that's just not true.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.500]   There is an element of truth to it,
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.660]   but it's not the whole truth.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.800]   And certainly if you look at history,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.380]   the people that excel in combat are the people
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.660]   that maybe have a little bit of a rebellious streak,
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.060]   people that are just more creative and more open-minded.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.060]   - Some of my friends from the SEAL teams
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.340]   will sometimes throw out stereotypes
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.660]   about the different divisions in the military.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.380]   Is there any truth to this idea that, you know,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.420]   Air Force types are one way and Marines are one way
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.540]   and Navy is one way, Army is a certain way,
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.020]   like sort of a general contour of personality,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.380]   or is that just kind of inside ball joking around?
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.660]   - It's a little bit of both.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.340]   I mean, certainly the Marine Corps is steeped in tradition.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.600]   And if you make a guess at what a Marine,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.100]   when you meet or if you had to guess
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.520]   what a Marine is gonna be like,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.460]   you're probably gonna be pretty close.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.020]   I mean, Marines have a incredible program
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.620]   to indoctrinate their people
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.100]   into the culture of the Marine Corps.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.740]   And the Marine Corps has an incredibly strong culture.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.940]   It's a powerful culture.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.780]   I love the Marine Corps.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.420]   I've worked with the Marine Corps a ton
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.840]   and they're outstanding.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.640]   As a generality, certainly you could make those assumptions
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.060]   about the Marines in general.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.780]   Now, does that mean that every Marine is the same?
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.000]   No, absolutely not.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.220]   Same thing with the Army, same thing with the Air Force,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.260]   same thing with the Navy.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.020]   You've got these kinds of stereotypes
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.700]   that exist for a reason.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.540]   You know, it's interesting too.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.340]   It's one of my friends named Ben Milligan
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.040]   wrote an incredible book called "By Water Beneath the Walls,"
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.780]   which I've given him a huge hassle about
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.700]   because it's the worst title of all time.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.320]   But it's certainly the best book written
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.460]   about the SEAL team's history
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.600]   and where the SEAL teams came from.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.660]   And it's interesting, it's something that I had heard
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.940]   from a SEAL officer that had given a speech years ago
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.760]   to his change of command.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.600]   And what he said was,
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.580]   "Hey, listen, he was trying to emphasize
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.220]   "why the SEAL teams were good."
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.500]   And one of the things he said was,
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.940]   you know, in the Army, and he was talking historically,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.980]   he goes, "Hey, in the Army, if you start to lose a battle,
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.460]   "you can just retreat and run away."
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.340]   In the Navy, traditionally, we're fighting on board a ship.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.660]   And if that ship, if we can't run away,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.980]   we're fighting, and if we lose, we die.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.620]   So SEALs can't quit.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.940]   It was sort of this, you know,
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.180]   a little over the top expression.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.620]   But when you take that a little bit further,
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.240]   when you look at the history of the Navy,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.660]   if you're, you know, if we were in the Navy 150 years ago,
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.220]   you would have to go on deployment.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.620]   You would take your ship, and you would sail somewhere,
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.600]   and you wouldn't be able to talk to me anymore.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.300]   So you would have to understand
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.620]   what it is you were trying to accomplish,
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.660]   and then just go out there and make it happen.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.900]   That's decentralized command.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.240]   And that's something that exists in the SEAL teams
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.620]   without question, very decentralized command.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.900]   And that's one of the absolute strengths of the SEAL teams
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.620]   is you've got leaders at every level inside the organization
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.460]   that if they don't know exactly,
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.940]   if they're not told what to do,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.980]   they're gonna go, okay, I haven't been told what to do,
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.180]   but I'm gonna go figure it out.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.100]   And that's one of the strengths of the SEAL teams.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.140]   We also, we have more doctrine now,
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.420]   but when I came in the SEAL teams, there was no doctrine.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.680]   It was all word of mouth.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.860]   And so the Army and the Marine Corps,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.260]   if you have to conduct an ambush,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.020]   you can pull out a manual,
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.820]   and you can look up how to conduct an ambush,
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.060]   platoon ambush, how to conduct it,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.520]   and it's all written very clear,
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.660]   and they're great documents.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.220]   It's the FM 7 TAC 8, infantry platoon and squad,
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.020]   I think is the Army doctrine.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.140]   - I can see little neurons in your hippocampus firing
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.100]   and see that it's embedded in there forever.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.420]   - And it's a great manual.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.800]   And you can pull that thing out,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.400]   and you have a place to start from.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.580]   In the SEAL teams, we didn't have that at all.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.440]   So you would hear from your platoon chief,
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.940]   this is how you conduct an ambush.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.500]   And he had heard it from his platoon chief,
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.780]   who heard it from his platoon chief,
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.260]   who heard it from his platoon chief,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.100]   and that platoon chief was in Vietnam.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.920]   So it's getting passed down, but you can make adjustments
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.980]   to it, and you can alter the plan a little bit,
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.700]   because hey, the terrain is different,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.900]   or hey, the night vision we now have.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.500]   So there's changes that we can make,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.900]   because there's no doctrine.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.420]   So not having any doctrine in many ways is a strength.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.400]   Also, it can be a weakness,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.980]   because if you've got a new platoon commander
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.580]   that's never done an ambush before,
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.780]   and he has no idea what he's doing,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.220]   and his platoon chief has been out of the loop for a long
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.420]   time, and he doesn't know what he's doing,
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.400]   there's no way, there's no reference.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.900]   So there's strengths and weaknesses,
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.140]   just like any characteristic, right?
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.740]   Everybody's characteristic, you've got strength,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.940]   and you've got weaknesses,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.340]   and your weaknesses can be strength,
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.420]   and your strength can be weaknesses.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.340]   To get back to your original question,
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   are there stereotypes inside of each
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.500]   of the military branches?
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.780]   Sure, but are there outliers in each
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.620]   of the military branches?
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.980]   There are absolutely, and that's why you can't judge a book
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.300]   by its cover.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.260]   For people listening to this who are not in the military,
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.860]   maybe have some military lineage in their family or not,
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.780]   but who want to understand a little bit better
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.400]   about how structure and lack of structure can both support
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.340]   being effective in life, in relationships,
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:57.340]   in daily life, in fitness, in business, in school,
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.740]   I think those are the big domains, in creative endeavors.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.260]   I think it would be useful for them to understand
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.940]   a little bit about how you in particular balance discipline
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.900]   and structure with, dare I say,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.740]   lack of discipline and structure.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.700]   - Well, you could actually just say the word freedom, right?
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.700]   'Cause that's what it turns into.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.500]   - Or maybe even play.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.100]   I bring this up in part because I've seen some posts
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.440]   that you put up of you playing the guitar with friends
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.800]   or music, one of them was a tribute to someone
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.540]   who either was killed in combat or had passed away.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.940]   So these moments of connection between people
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.180]   sometimes are working together,
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.100]   but sometimes are in relaxation and play
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.940]   and these kinds of things.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.340]   And I think it was a really important post
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.500]   for people to see that while Jocko Willink
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.620]   kicks back with a guitar, not trying to take over stages,
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.340]   maybe you are, maybe you have a plan,
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.780]   if anyone could do it, you'd probably be the one.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.620]   But what is the balance for you
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.800]   in terms of structure and lack of structure?
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.440]   And I'm not gonna ask for your daily routine.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.020]   We know that you get up early, you train,
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.460]   but I do have some specific questions
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.740]   that I think would be helpful in putting some meat
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.580]   on the notions about you.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.180]   And again, this isn't to pick into your life,
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.680]   but more to grab, well, it's to pick into your life.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.540]   So a question I asked you in the lobby,
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.860]   'cause it's one that having seen your content
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.900]   for a long time and really benefited from it,
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.300]   I was curious, you get up early at about 4.30,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.700]   you train every morning, how long do you train for?
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.780]   And is there any global structure to that?
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.340]   And of course, everyone needs different programs,
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.620]   but is it like weight training one day,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.640]   cardio training the next day, are you combining them?
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.480]   Is it always an hour?
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.700]   Is it always half an hour?
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.840]   I think people would benefit
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.420]   from getting a little bit more understanding
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.780]   of what that looks like for you with the caveat
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.040]   that everyone has different needs,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.120]   levels of background, et cetera.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.180]   But I'm intensely curious about this
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.820]   and I'm certain I'm not the only one.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.300]   - So do you wanna talk about weightlifting
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.260]   or rock and roll on the guitar?
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.320]   - I wanna talk about,
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.420]   let's talk about the most structured first part of your day
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.100]   and then let's talk about the least structured part
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.660]   of your day, at least the part that you can share
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.420]   with the world.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.340]   - Yeah, waking up early and I'm gonna work out
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.340]   and depending on what's going on that day,
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.020]   if I have an early flight,
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.680]   I might work out for eight minutes, right?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   I might go in and do 2000 meters on the roller,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.580]   get a sweat going, hard as I can and then I'm done
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.900]   and 'cause I gotta go catch a flight.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.060]   So that could be happening.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.620]   Maybe I'm supposed to go surfing in the morning,
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.380]   I wake up, the waves are terrible
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.060]   and so now I've got nothing to do.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.500]   I planned out to be surfing for two or three hours
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.900]   and now I'm not gonna go surfing.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.380]   So I'm gonna go lift and I'm gonna go play in the gym
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.220]   and do a bunch of stuff.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.140]   I'm gonna spend two or three hours in there.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.940]   I love doing that.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.780]   So the workout could be anywhere between,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.060]   what I just say, eight minutes and three hours
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.140]   and it could be anything in between.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:47.140]   I fully enjoy the physical aspect of working out.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.880]   So if I have more time to spend in the gym, I'll spend it.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.100]   I remember my dad saying at one point,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.300]   "If I retired, I wouldn't know what to do."
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.140]   And I was thinking to myself, are you serious right now?
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.400]   If I didn't have anything to do,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.300]   I'd spend six hours a day in the gym,
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.340]   I'd spend four hours doing jiu-jitsu.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.740]   Like I could fill my day,
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.100]   I could fill every day with just physical activity,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   things that I just like doing.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.580]   But that's, so wake up early, get a sweat going
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.260]   and do I lift?
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.080]   Yes.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.540]   Do I do cardio?
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.380]   Yes.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.200]   Do I run?
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.040]   Yes.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.880]   Do I sprint?
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.700]   Yes.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.540]   Do I lift heavy weights?
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.380]   Yes.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.200]   Do I swing kettlebells?
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.040]   Yes.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.140]   Do I do anything and I enjoy all of it
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.940]   and I'm not really good at any of it.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.400]   You know, I'm not really good at any one aspect
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.860]   of physical activity.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.420]   I'm, there's people that are infinitely better at me
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.980]   in every aspect of, and I'm not just talking about,
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.220]   oh, this guy's a world-class lift.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.000]   No, there's like a guy named Fred down at the gym
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.380]   that can deadlift more than me.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.980]   There was a guy, when I was at SEAL team too,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.640]   there was a guy who was probably five, seven,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.920]   and he looked kind of chubby.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.020]   And he was older than me and he could run faster than me
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.980]   and he could bench more than me.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.180]   Those guys are out there.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.420]   It was just so bothersome.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.300]   Yeah, they're out there.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.460]   They got some engine in there related to something.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.220]   I mean, I do think there are genetic differences
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.620]   in terms of people's resilience and workout,
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.620]   but even just grip strength is highly,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.380]   highly subjected to like genetic influences,
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.720]   maximum grip strength.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.940]   But of course there's a huge range
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.880]   in what people can develop.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.540]   But I guarantee your grip strength is greater than mine.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.640]   People ask me this all the time,
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.000]   who would win an arm wrestling between you and Jocko?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.220]   I'm like, Jocko.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.060]   Who would win it?
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.880]   Jocko?
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.580]   - You know there's a lot of technique in arm wrestling.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.760]   - I have to imagine they're putting their body behind it.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   They're putting their back in.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.420]   - It's not just that.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.240]   Like there is legitimate technique in arm wrestling.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.240]   - There's hope for me yet.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.320]   - Yeah, there's no,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.000]   like if we could bring a female arm wrestler in here
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.240]   that knows how to arm wrestle,
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.820]   because I don't know how to arm wrestle either,
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.980]   and she would be both of us.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.800]   Because there's a lot more technique in arm wrestling
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.940]   than you know, than most people recognize.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.700]   There's all these little games that are going on.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.040]   There's all this little arm position that you get.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.860]   So just like everything else, it's technique.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.320]   There's a lot of technique in arm wrestling.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.160]   - That's good to know.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.440]   I didn't know that about arm wrestling.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.860]   I think we all start off with some genetic predispositions,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.560]   both good and bad for different things.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.440]   And then there's, as far as we know,
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.080]   there's a huge range based through neuroplasticity
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.720]   and muscle adaptation, et cetera, in what we can obtain.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.960]   So I never want genetic predisposition to serve as a barrier.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.860]   No one knows also what the upper limits
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.280]   of any of these things are.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.000]   And some of the best examples we know from sport
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.040]   and certainly from academia are people
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.960]   who knew they were at a disadvantage
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.280]   and just worked 10 times harder than everybody else
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.600]   because they had an ax to grind
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.260]   with their genetic disadvantage,
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.480]   which is really cool at the face of it.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.880]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.920]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.380]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.760]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.640]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.340]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.560]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.160]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.240]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.320]   once or usually twice a day is that it gets to be
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.820]   the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.920]   Our gut is very important.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.480]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.220]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.620]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.280]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.280]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.960]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.520]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.940]   vitamins, and minerals that make sure
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.880]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.760]   and it tastes great.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.220]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.600]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.580]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.900]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.200]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.480]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.880]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.580]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.960]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.920]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.760]   So you get the training and do track your training
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.920]   in a detailed way?
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.560]   Are you keeping track of lifts and-
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.640]   - So I write down what I do and I'll write down,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.200]   I write down what I do every day.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.680]   And that way I can go back and say,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.120]   you know, what was I doing back then?
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.680]   'Cause I might go through some phase
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.260]   where I'm trying to do more pull-ups
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.160]   or I'm trying to deadlift more and I'm trying,
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.360]   or whatever the thing is, I'll go back into,
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.400]   'cause I got bored of deadlifting after a while.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.260]   Let's face it, if you just want to be a good deadlifter,
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.020]   you're not going to be that fast, right?
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.640]   You're going to be slow on long runs.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.480]   So you don't want to go too deep into deadlifting.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.660]   And you also don't want to be so good at long runs
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.080]   that you can't deadlift a good amount of weight.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.940]   So I got to go through phases
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.100]   and I'll get into something for a while
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.200]   and I'll get into something else.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.720]   So I do log down what I'm doing.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.580]   So I can look back and say, oh, dang, you know,
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.800]   I'm not even close to as strong as I used to be,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.680]   need to get back to that.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.960]   I'm fascinated by the concept of energy.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.520]   I think it's one of the most interesting aspects
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.800]   in all of biology, all of psychology, and all of life.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.320]   And when I say energy, I mean the distinction
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.160]   between being back on your heels,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.960]   flat-footed or forward center of mass, you know?
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.980]   And I get the impression,
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.640]   and I think everyone gets the impression
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.000]   that you're somebody with a lot of energy.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.520]   And I wonder whether or not you wake up
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.680]   with a lot of energy and you feel like you have
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.060]   to burn it off with this physical activity
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.080]   and work and other demands in your life,
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.900]   or do you find that you wake up
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.800]   and your energy is kind of neutral
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.560]   and exercise and physical activity gives you energy?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.840]   'Cause I think this is one of the key things out there,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   I think, that acts as a barrier
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.640]   for people doing more with their body
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.760]   because maybe they don't want to tire themselves out
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.720]   or maybe they don't feel like they have enough energy
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.360]   to begin with.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.820]   It also feeds into this idea that,
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.460]   oh, you know, some people just have a lot of energy.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.520]   They're really physical and other people aren't.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.560]   So let's just say on most days,
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.280]   do you wake up feeling like you want to burn off energy,
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.160]   build energy?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.520]   What does exercise mean to you?
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.560]   And then maybe we can talk about some
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.800]   of the underlying stuff going on there
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.320]   'cause I think we both might find it interesting.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.060]   - I would say it's both, right?
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.540]   There's no way I could sit here and say,
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.120]   oh yeah, every day that alarm clock goes off
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.800]   and I'm like, oh yeah, let's rock and roll.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.240]   Certainly that's not the case.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.200]   It's also certainly not the case that every day I'm like,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.360]   oh God, not again.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.600]   No, I'd say most of the time the alarm clock goes off
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.880]   and I don't think a bunch.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.140]   Like when my alarm clock goes off,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.920]   I don't think a bunch.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.480]   I don't debate with myself.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.800]   I'm not negotiating.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.040]   I just, the thing goes off
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.400]   and I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.000]   Sort of robotic.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.380]   Now this much I can say,
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.280]   when you go and work out, you're going to feel better.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.480]   You will get energy from working out.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.960]   That is a guarantee.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.560]   If you go work out, you're going to feel better.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.520]   If you go break a sweat, you're going to feel better.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.080]   You're going to get more energy from it.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.980]   And look, you got to go really, really hard
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.320]   to where now you feel more tired when you're done.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.960]   And even that, I mean, you got to go psycho.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.160]   I'll do that occasionally,
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.240]   but I don't do that on a daily basis.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.480]   You know, at the end of a day,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   if I wake up, lift, run, surf,
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.380]   and then I do jujitsu in the afternoon,
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.360]   like at the end of that day, I'm tired.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.880]   And I feel tired.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.720]   But normal day, working out just makes you feel better.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.520]   It definitely gives me energy, I should say,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.000]   'cause I guess I'm not everybody.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.580]   - Yeah, I think it's a very important point
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.600]   because one of the things that we are learning
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.320]   from circadian biology, you know, time of day effects
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.640]   and sunlight and all that stuff
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.160]   that we talk about in our podcast,
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.480]   that you've done intuitively, right?
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.640]   This is what we kind of arrived to.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.480]   - Yeah, it was kind of crazy.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.060]   - Last time we had a conversation is that
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.200]   so many of the things that science is telling us to do
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.660]   and that we emphasize on the podcast,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.280]   this podcast you've been doing,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.880]   or are built into military schedules,
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.280]   and one of them is this notion of waking up early
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.360]   and getting physical early in the day.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.560]   And I suppose if we were to just throw one blanket rule
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.460]   on the table to encompass the broadest number of themes,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.160]   it's that once every 24 hours,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.440]   we each and all get a big increase
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.280]   in this release of the hormone cortisol,
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.300]   which everyone says, "Oh, cortisol, it's terrible.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.520]   You know, he's going to burn you out,
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.600]   adrenal burnout, all that stuff."
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.060]   But it's a non-negotiable peak.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.960]   And you want it to arrive early in the day
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   and viewing sunlight, physical activity, caffeine,
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.680]   and in particular, intense exercise,
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.400]   all amplify that cortisol peak.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.800]   In fact, I think the numbers I'm seeing is
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.760]   just sunlight viewing gives you a 50% increase
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.600]   in that cortisol.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.520]   Exercise on top of that, another 50 to 75% increase.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.400]   So this huge release in this hormone
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.400]   that everyone thinks is terrible,
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.860]   but actually sets this huge wave in motion
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.880]   for the rest of the day,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.280]   which gives you more energy,
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.560]   higher levels of immune function, more focus, et cetera.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.640]   And does indeed, as you mentioned in your example
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.280]   of your daily life, sets a timer
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.320]   so that about 14 to 16 hours later, you're sleepy,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.580]   which is what you want, 14 to 16 hours later,
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.520]   unless of course you're running vampire shifts
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.900]   in the military or you're on shift work,
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.680]   but most people aren't, of course.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.600]   So I think the idea that movement and exercise
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.360]   gives us energy, I think is an important idea.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.000]   And it's something that I was, frankly,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.960]   I was hoping your answer would be that,
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   as opposed to that, you know, you wake up every day
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.780]   and you just want to just attack the world
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.440]   because you have so much energy getting out of bed
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.360]   because frankly, I never feel that way.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.400]   But I always feel better after I train, always.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.800]   And of course, there are times when I crash
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.580]   in the early afternoon if I train really, really hard,
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.960]   but usually that's when I over caffeinate
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.680]   to an outrageous degree.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.260]   And then I don't nourish after, or I over nourish.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.000]   So this is the other thing that eating the whole rest
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.960]   and digesting the digest word in there
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.320]   is meant to, it's there for a reason,
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.160]   which is that when we eat a really big meal,
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.200]   we actually need to slow down.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.400]   So I hate to get into daily schedules
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.900]   at the level of nitpicking and nutrition
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.540]   is about the most controversial topic on the internet.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:52.480]   But do you nourish after you train?
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.040]   And if you do, do you do it to the point
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.780]   where you're kind of like, okay, I'm mostly full
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.120]   or I'm full, are you trying to really nourish yourself?
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.720]   Or do you find that eating slows you down?
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.560]   - I find that eating slows me down.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.600]   And I would say, again, it's weird
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.300]   how some of this stuff is like,
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.100]   the main reason I got in the habit of waking up early
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.320]   and working out is 'cause if you do it
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.480]   before anyone else is awake, then they can't bother you
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.640]   and you can get stuff done, right?
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.160]   You go to the SEAL team and you get there
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.120]   before anyone else is there, no one can say,
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.040]   hey, can you help us with this?
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.200]   Hey, no one sent you an email.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.120]   So you get that time, you get it done and it's yours, right?
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.920]   I remember when you were on my podcast
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.720]   and I don't wear sunglasses when I run in the morning
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.920]   because I sweat and it fills my sunglasses.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.640]   It's not because I wanna let the UV light into my eyes,
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   that's not why. - Cortisol boost.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.800]   - Right, it's not for the cortisol.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.440]   I didn't know that, it's cool that I know it now,
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.640]   but I just did it because I don't like sweat
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.320]   and my sunglasses can't see,
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.780]   so I just run without 'em and put a hat on.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.560]   As far as eating, I don't like to do physically active
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.760]   things with food in my stomach, that's just the way it is.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.920]   - Yeah, me either. - And so I don't wanna,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.120]   and what really keeps that in line for me is
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   I'm doing jiu-jitsu in the afternoon
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.200]   and so if I'm eating a big lunch,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.700]   by the time the afternoon rolls around,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.520]   I'm kinda, I got food in my gut
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.600]   and I just don't like that feeling.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.460]   So no, I don't eat a big meal until I'm kinda done
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.720]   with the physical stuff for the day,
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.400]   which is usually at night, six, seven o'clock at night,
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.040]   which I guess there's some bad things about that.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.120]   I eat too late.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.920]   - Well, the data say, if you're,
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.000]   yeah, we could go down a rabbit hole with this
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.140]   and then someone's gonna pull up some little clinical study
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.800]   and then another one that counters that.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.520]   I mean, I think the data essentially say
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.360]   that having a regular meal schedule
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.040]   that allows you to sleep well at night,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.860]   whatever that means for you,
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.680]   and that allows you to be active and focused
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.440]   when you need to be active and focused,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.120]   that's the ideal schedule.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.740]   - I, when I'm working with clients,
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.220]   like so I have a leadership consulting company,
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.720]   Echelon Front, when I'm going to work with a client,
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.420]   I'm not eating, 'cause they're gonna be asking me questions,
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.000]   we're gonna be diving into what's happening
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.900]   inside their business, like there's a lot of stuff going on,
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.620]   it's a lot of cognitive work.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.580]   So I'm not eating before a podcast,
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.160]   I'm not eating before a podcast.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.520]   Before I'm recording a podcast, I'm not eating,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   'cause I don't wanna have a bunch of food in my stomach,
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.420]   I wanna, you get a certain level of mental clarity
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.320]   when you haven't eaten a bunch of food.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.920]   So going out on missions,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.020]   I never would eat before I go out on a mission.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.960]   I would eat when I come home.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.360]   You get home four o'clock in the morning,
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.000]   three o'clock in the morning from doing operation, cool,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.960]   then I'll eat.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.040]   'Cause then I'm gonna do a debrief for 15 minutes,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.680]   clean weapons, and then eat a big meal, go to sleep, cool.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.320]   Yeah, I don't wanna have food in my stomach
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.500]   when I've gotta perform or execute anything.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.800]   So again, I think that's just kind of a fluke
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.480]   that I ended up living like that,
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.160]   but that's kinda how I live.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.120]   - It's a fortunate fluke for all of us,
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.800]   because so much of what you embody and what you do,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.780]   I think, centers around this idea of discipline, of course,
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.920]   but also energy.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.980]   It's the intuitive sense I get
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.480]   about why people are so drawn to your messaging
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.920]   and what you do and how you do it.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.280]   Energy, we know, of course, is caloric energy.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.800]   I think that's what most people default to.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.660]   They go, oh, how many calories are energy
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:05.760]   and how many calories in that?
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.480]   And you need calories to fuel things.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.700]   But the energy that you're describing,
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.240]   I think, is the one that,
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.920]   well, it really maps to Eastern traditions more directly,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.000]   the whole yin and yang thing, yin and yang,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.460]   I always get that wrong,
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.080]   which is the notion of neural energy.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.920]   And so there's a particular cluster of chemicals in us,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.880]   it has a fancy name called the catecholamines,
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.840]   but that's dopamine, epinephrine,
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.880]   which is adrenaline, and norepinephrine.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.800]   And then you've got cortisol.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.080]   And those four hang out together
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.840]   and basically give us enough energy
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.560]   to run our brain and body for 50 days, 50 days.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.440]   So the idea that you have to eat before you train,
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.000]   sure, for some people that might work better than others,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.360]   but I think what people don't realize
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.480]   is that anytime we're taking in caloric energy,
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.720]   it takes neural energy in order to digest that
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.080]   and put it into storage.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.640]   And so the way you describe your day of,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.180]   yeah, I also don't eat before I train,
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.880]   I like to hydrate and caffeinate.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.160]   I have been drinking these before I train.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.080]   I have to limit myself to two before,
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.220]   'cause otherwise I'm like picking up,
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.320]   I'm already quaking a little bit at the second one,
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.640]   but I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   So I like to train fasted also,
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.280]   and then I find it gives me energy.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.740]   But then the moment that I eat a meal
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.620]   that's a little too large,
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.960]   all of a sudden I'm out of energy and what's the deal?
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.240]   This calories are energy, right?
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.920]   You're supposed to have energy in order to think and move.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.360]   And I think a lot of the world has this backwards,
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.620]   and this isn't a push for intermittent fasting
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.560]   or any particular style of eating, really.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.920]   I don't care if people are carnivore or vegan,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.300]   doesn't matter to me, whatever works.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.560]   I happen to be an omnivore.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.760]   But I think once people understand
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.680]   the energy to do things is neural,
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.080]   and yet of course it relies on having glycogen
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.900]   and all this stuff around,
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.720]   but neural energy is what it's really about.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.020]   Then your schedule and the way you function
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.440]   and the way you describe your schedule
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.480]   really makes a ton of sense.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.000]   So you described getting up and lifting,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.120]   running, surfing and jujitsu in the same day.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.160]   So on a day like that, you're hydrating, correct?
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.680]   - Oh yeah, definitely. - Yeah, 'cause that's vital.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.500]   And I know in the teams, in the SEAL teams,
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.520]   there's a lot of discussion about hydration as important,
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.880]   even though you guys I know are supposed to be able
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.200]   to eat sand and survive on sunlight and dirt
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.240]   and drink your own blood. - Not me.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.160]   - Hydration's taken seriously, right?
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.600]   - Yeah, and different people
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.760]   need different amount of hydration.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.080]   And I unfortunately was one of,
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.120]   I always needed to bring a lot of water in the field,
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.040]   which sucked 'cause water's heavy.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.840]   And I have friends, one of my friends, Tony, BTF Tony,
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.480]   he'd go in the field with like a can of Copenhagen
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.720]   and coffee in his canteen and go like three straight days.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.000]   - He's like a desert turtle. - He's a desert rat, man.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.680]   He could just survive.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.160]   And I would always have to bring a ton of water.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.640]   And I sweat a ton when I work out
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.960]   or when I'm doing anything
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.840]   that requires physical output, I sweat a ton.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.040]   So I have to drink a lot of water for sure.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.360]   But not everyone's the same, you know?
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.280]   - Yeah, I think if most people focused
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.760]   more on hydration and movement,
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.040]   they would find they have two,
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.200]   I'm gonna venture a guess here,
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.360]   this is not a scientific study,
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.760]   but two to four times more energy
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.480]   than if they focused on caloric energy and what to eat.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.920]   - Yeah, and I think the cool thing about this,
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.040]   you're using the term energy.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.440]   And what's cool about this is you or I,
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   I create energy, right?
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.720]   I create energy by, like I said,
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.960]   by going and lifting in the morning,
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.480]   by going and doing burp.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.840]   You go do burpees, you go do a hundred burpees,
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.240]   like you're creating energy.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.880]   You're gonna be tired, you're gonna be sweating,
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.320]   but you just created energy.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.440]   So that stuff is totally true.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.360]   I'm glad there's neuroscience to back it up.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.960]   - Yeah, I'm actually thinking about devoting
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.040]   some of my lab to this.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.200]   You know, one of the best examples,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.400]   another familiar territory for you is cold water.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.160]   You know, nowadays there's a lot about ice baths
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.720]   and cold baths and showers and all that.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.560]   And I always like to just say, listen,
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:50.000]   it's all just a reliable source
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.840]   of inducing adrenaline release.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.880]   And you get out of a cold shower, you have more energy,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.360]   and that energy couldn't have been caloric energy.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.520]   It's adrenaline.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.080]   And I, you know, again, it's fair to say I'm obsessed
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.120]   by the ideas of identity,
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.380]   which is a little bit how we started off,
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.880]   and I wanna get back to it, and energy.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   I feel like identity and energy can account for 75%
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.960]   of what it is to, you know, live a good life
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.800]   if you can master those,
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.560]   because then it all seems to fall into bins.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.780]   It's like, of course you need sleep, why?
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.460]   Well, to restore your neural energy, right?
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.380]   At some point you just fade out of neural energy
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.220]   if you don't sleep.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.560]   So sleep then falls into a particular bin
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.880]   with a particular purpose.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.320]   And then exercise becomes not a way to like burn energy,
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.720]   but as you said, to create energy.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.440]   And we actually are starting to understand why this is.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.540]   If you'll indulge me for a second on some neuroscience,
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.000]   we didn't talk about this last time.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.320]   We have neural circuits that control deliberate action.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.200]   We have neural circuits that control deliberate actions
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.560]   that we forget that we're doing, like walking.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.560]   And then we have neural circuits
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.480]   which are called central pattern generators.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.000]   And these are the neural circuits
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.440]   that love to just work on their own,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.480]   and in the background, just kind of hum in the background
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.560]   and take care of all the stuff like heartbeat breathing
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.440]   and movement that is repetitive.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.840]   Like if you're just marching
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.520]   and you don't have to adjust your cadence much,
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.680]   or maybe you're hiking even,
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.320]   and step in this rock, that rock.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.840]   Once those central pattern generators get going,
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.240]   it's very automatic.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.320]   And we know that once those central pattern generators
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.340]   get going, there's the release of those catecholamines,
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.220]   those three or four molecules
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.940]   that then feed all the other neural systems.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.400]   They're called neuromodulators for a reason
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.120]   'cause they set the gain higher.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.120]   So then you go out for a run or a jog or a hike or something,
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.760]   or you pedal or you row,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.680]   and then your whole system is at a higher RPM.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.240]   So when you say create energy,
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.320]   neuroscientists are starting to understand what that is,
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.080]   repetitive movement that allows you to forget
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.040]   the motor commands that are required
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.960]   to generate that movement.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.480]   You might think about your row stroke
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.560]   or something like that,
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.220]   but you can do it without thinking much.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:51.300]   You come off of that and you now are set at a higher RPM
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.960]   to do more deliberate stuff.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.040]   And none of this, again,
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.880]   involved like eating enough carbohydrates
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.440]   or making sure you had enough ketones or enough protein.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.240]   It's like you got plenty of that stuff
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.320]   provided you nourish at some point every 24 hours or so.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.460]   So I think we know a little bit about the science
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.800]   behind Jocko Willink's schedule now,
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.960]   but I will ask this.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.240]   Are there certain forms of exercise
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.120]   like weightlifting versus cardio
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:20.040]   that you find give you an especially big boost
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.220]   in what we're calling energy?
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.840]   And here, this could be cognitive energy,
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.680]   it could be physical energy,
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.200]   but a readiness for the next thing.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.040]   - Yeah, first I got to back you up on this.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.440]   I love backing up your science.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.400]   So do you ever rock march,
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.800]   like put on a heavyweight and rock?
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.640]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.200]   Yeah, Peter Attia got me into this.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.080]   He got me into doing a long Sunday,
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.400]   instead of a long Sunday run,
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.360]   throwing on a lightweight vest or a rock
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.120]   and going out for like three hours.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.220]   And the first 20 minutes I find
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.380]   I always want to go faster and get it over with.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.000]   But then I've learned that the real pain in it
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.380]   sets in around an hour.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.320]   And then the beauty sets in around 90 minutes
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.440]   where you're like, I could do this all day, all night,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.600]   and I never want to stop.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.840]   - See, that's when you were describing how
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.860]   these chemicals get released
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.240]   and once you're in that automatic mode.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.680]   'Cause in the SEAL teams,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.880]   you're doing maritime operations for a month
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.360]   and then you're going to do some kill house shooting.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.480]   And so you're not carrying a bunch of weight.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.440]   And then you go out to the desert
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.120]   and now you're putting on 80 pounds
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.000]   and you're going on like day one
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:22.840]   and you get out there,
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.440]   you're going on an 80 pound ruck march.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.100]   And the first freaking 17 minutes,
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.120]   the first 23 minutes just suck.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.240]   They just suck.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.180]   And what was beautiful was by the time I was, you know,
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.940]   23, 24 years old, I'm like, oh yeah,
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.200]   this is going to suck for 17 minutes.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.000]   And then it's going to be, I'm going to be a robot
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.920]   and it doesn't matter anymore.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.360]   I can just keep going forever.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.420]   So it sounds like what you're saying
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.300]   is what I experienced my, basically my whole adult life.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.140]   There's going to be a little break in period mentally
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.680]   where you think this totally sucks
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.340]   and then you just can keep going
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.200]   for a really, really long time.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.240]   And it's not that big of a deal.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.980]   To your question of, is there any form of exercise
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.560]   that gives me that energy boost?
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.680]   I would have to say like the high intensity
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.120]   sort of anaerobic blast, you know,
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.400]   whether it's on the bike or on the rower
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.820]   or, you know, swinging a kettlebell hard,
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.120]   something like that, that last 10, 15 minutes,
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.520]   that's a really good way to, you know,
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.660]   peak my mentality for the day.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.040]   - Do you do the cold water thing?
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.720]   I mean, you certainly did a lot of it in buds.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.760]   I mean, do you force yourself into cold water?
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.300]   - I have a cold bath in my house and I get in every day.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.680]   - How long are you spending in there?
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.560]   - Usually around five minutes, five minutes.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.200]   - Before you train or after you train?
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.080]   - No, after.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.680]   So this is something I haven't played with yet.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.560]   And for me, I'm like, I'm like such a,
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.440]   I don't like to make a bunch of effort for something.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.520]   So for me, going downstairs, getting in the ice tub,
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.200]   and I guess you only need to do it in the,
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.400]   before you work out, you only go a minute, right?
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.240]   - Do a minute to three.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.280]   Joe and I have been texting back and forth about this.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.040]   There's a lab at Stanford, Craig Heller's lab,
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.320]   that works on cold and performance.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.480]   And the athletes at Stanford,
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.240]   mainly the cross country team and the football players
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.760]   are doing cold before their training
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.340]   because of the huge increase,
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.060]   huge long lasting increase in dopamine and adrenaline
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.540]   that's caused by that.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.040]   They're finding it increases performance,
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.720]   mainly by waking people up and getting them,
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.200]   it creates energy basically.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.780]   And students, you know, everyone thinks they're like,
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.080]   oh, athletes are all super motivated.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.880]   This is no pick against Stanford athletes in particular.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.680]   A lot of athletes are excellent at what they do
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.360]   because they're very lazy when they're not training.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.880]   This is true, not all athletes, but a lot of athletes are.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.600]   And so they're really good at resting and recovering
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.800]   so they can train more.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.120]   But a lot of athletes have a hard time getting into gear
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.960]   to train every day.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.680]   And the cold is a great stimulus, right?
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.880]   It's like a four shot of espresso kind of stimulus
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.440]   without all the jitters.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.820]   - I think maybe going in there for a minute
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.380]   would be cool before a workout.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.520]   I will say this.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:52.040]   So I had like a long workout and it was a Saturday,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.640]   which means on Saturday I do jiu-jitsu
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.540]   kind of in the morning around 10 o'clock.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:56:00.440]   And I had like a long workout, went for a long run.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.520]   It was hot and I just got in the ice bath
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.520]   and I sat in there for like seven minutes,
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.440]   like the deep chill.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.840]   I got out and then I went right to jiu-jitsu
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.280]   and I felt awful.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.940]   I felt absolutely awful, like tight cold.
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:15.440]   And it took me an extra three rounds to get warmed up again.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.920]   So that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.160]   for pre-work icing.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.280]   But I'm gonna try this short
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.320]   'cause I was talking to another friend of mine.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.920]   They're like, oh no, only go a minute before.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.880]   Maybe I'll give that a try.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.520]   - If it's really cold, 30 seconds to a minute
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.580]   is gonna get you this big release in adrenaline and dopamine.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:37.660]   - Actually one time I did try the chamber
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.320]   that blasts cold air on you.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.140]   - The cryo.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:40.980]   - Yeah, the cryo.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.720]   And I did that for like a minute or whatever.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.520]   And that did make me feel pre-workout pretty good.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.080]   - Yeah, I think that the whole notion of cold
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.580]   for metabolism, people say,
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.520]   well, it's not that big of an increase in metabolism.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.360]   Look, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.440]   the main function of the cold for most people
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.720]   is going to be the discipline of doing it,
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.680]   the sense of resilience that you can build up over time,
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.860]   just being familiar with having an adrenaline in your system.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.880]   And then the fact that the dopamine increases
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.240]   are huge and long lasting.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.720]   I mean, they're like 2.5 X increases.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.640]   There's a colleague of mine at Stanford, Anna Lemke,
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.800]   who runs our dual diagnosis addiction clinic.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.320]   She had a patient getting off cocaine addiction
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.360]   who decided to use cold ice baths
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.840]   as a way to kind of assist himself along the way.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.680]   You know, he wasn't getting dopamine from cocaine anymore.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.560]   So he decided to get it from the ice bath.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.840]   The difference is cocaine gives you these sharp increases
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.180]   and then decreases that drop you way below baseline.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.900]   So what do people do if they go seek more cocaine?
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.520]   It's really pernicious that way.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.860]   Whereas the ice bath and cold showers
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.720]   will give this long arc lasting two to three hours or more.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.360]   And that's really something to treasure.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.180]   You know, the idea that you can basically save
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.880]   on your heating bill, you know,
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.800]   give yourself this huge dopamine increase.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.300]   And I think everything points to the fact
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.400]   that it's healthy and good.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.100]   But I mean, obviously it's working for you
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.080]   to do it after your training.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.720]   I think all the gym rats who want more hypertrophy,
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.780]   you're trying to get an extra, you know,
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.720]   eighth of an inch on their tricep or whatever.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.800]   They freak out 'cause they hear
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.840]   that it can inhibit hypertrophy.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.640]   And then for whatever reason, there's this-
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.720]   - So am I doing it wrong?
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.280]   - Well, I mean, yeah, clearly you're doing it right now.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   No, I don't think your hypertrophy is suffering.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.240]   I actually am of the mind that
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.380]   if you're training really hard,
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.200]   sure, getting in the cold afterwards
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.840]   might blunt some hypertrophy.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.320]   That is what the data tell us.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.140]   Andy Galpin's kind of the expert on that literature.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:28.060]   But frankly, I don't know anyone
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.840]   that trains really hard with the weights
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.960]   and then gets into the cold
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.080]   that looks like they're suffering from hypertrophy.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.440]   I know a lot of people, however,
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.200]   who love to point fingers at and poke at cold exposure.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.660]   This seems to be a big thing on social media.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.440]   People who don't like the cold
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.840]   love to point out the studies
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.240]   showing that the cold screws up everything.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.760]   And most of them look like they need
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.000]   a few sets in the gym to me.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.800]   And you know, and I feel comfortable poking at them
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.680]   'cause I feel like all of these are just tools, right?
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.820]   And in any case, I'm a big fan of deliberate cold exposure,
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:58.360]   mostly for the neural effects.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.000]   Again, I'm obsessing over this concept of energy.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.320]   And it's something that I can't help but ask
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.880]   is the cognitive side of this
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.920]   and the kind of the effects of winning and losing.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.360]   So you obviously have a lot of deployments
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.160]   and a lot of wins, whatever in the context that meant, right?
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.800]   Kill the target, capture the hostage, et cetera.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.000]   And then, as is the case with war,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.880]   there have been some cases of losses, right?
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.400]   You've lost people.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.960]   Maybe there were targets that weren't accomplished, right?
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.800]   This kind of thing.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.960]   And you've posted about these and these are always,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.640]   you know, things that are hard to see,
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.440]   but I think it's really important
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.840]   that you post about people that you've lost, right?
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.000]   Because first of all, these people served,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.680]   but second of all, that things don't always work out
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.080]   the way that we wanted sometimes
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.540]   to really catastrophic consequences.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:53.540]   There's a theory in biology that when we win,
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.940]   we somehow get more energy to win more
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.040]   through the release of, no surprise,
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.860]   dopamine and some related molecules.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.140]   And in fact, testosterone in both men and women
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.500]   is another close cousin of the dopamine system.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.660]   They're actually released from the same general,
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.040]   or the patterns of release are from the same general areas
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.220]   in the brain, believe it or not, and body.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.820]   But when we win, we feel like we can keep going, right?
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.420]   You look at the team that wins and it's like,
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.880]   they'll play another game.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.220]   The Super Bowl winners, imagine they're jumping up and down
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.940]   and they could probably play another Super Bowl.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.540]   Losing, we know, sure can drop things like testosterone
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.140]   and dopamine for some period of time,
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.440]   but when you were in the teams,
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.300]   what was your observation about how winning and losing
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.780]   would impact people in the short and long term?
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.160]   In other words, would you observe people
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.780]   that had a quick reset button
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.260]   and could just say, "That was terrible."
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.780]   And then transmute, I guess I'm getting into
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.840]   kind of the Eastern language now,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   convert that into energy to go do better the next time.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.740]   Whereas we also see people, military
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.140]   and in the civilian world, that a loss,
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.920]   in particular severe losses,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.240]   basically set them down the path of like less energy.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.600]   It certainly isn't less calories.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.800]   In fact, most of the time it's the other way.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.020]   They start consuming more calories
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.020]   and that doesn't get them going.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.620]   So again, this notion of energy,
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.340]   and now I'm asking wins versus losses.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.700]   What did you observe?
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.780]   And from the perspective of leadership,
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.140]   and maybe more importantly from the perspective of yourself,
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.840]   how do you work with that?
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.780]   How do you calibrate wins and losses?
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.620]   How do you transmute losses into energy?
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.820]   Because wins we know convert to energy,
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.160]   but losses oftentimes can sap our energy way, way down.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.780]   - I think to start with,
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.620]   I think that the selection process
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.940]   to get into the SEAL teams
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.060]   is going to weed out a bunch of people
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.620]   that can't recover very quickly from something bad.
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.200]   So you probably heard these type of stories before.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.720]   The kid that was the star of the football team,
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.800]   the star of the basketball team,
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.320]   the captain of this, the captain of that,
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.460]   he's been winning his whole life.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.820]   He goes to Buds and he quits.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.540]   Because in Buds, you're not gonna win.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.640]   You're certainly not gonna win everything.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.340]   They're gonna find what you're not good at
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.420]   and they're gonna exploit that
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.220]   and you're gonna lose.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.780]   This is what happens.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.660]   So a lot of guys that may lose
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.980]   and it disrupts their motivation,
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.220]   they're probably just gonna quit.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.660]   And so that's why you get this massive attrition rate
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.860]   with guys that are studs.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.720]   I mean, we're talking division one athletes,
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.360]   division one athlete, division one wrestlers,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.520]   division one football players,
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.920]   division one runners and swimmers.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.820]   They all come to Buds.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.200]   They all quit, not all of them quit,
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.700]   but there's plenty of examples
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:46.560]   of the highest level of collegiate athlete
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.420]   in sports that translate very well
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:54.340]   to what you're doing in basic SEAL training and they quit.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.780]   And sometimes it's because they don't know how to lose.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.040]   They don't know how to recover from a loss
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.040]   and they're just, so I think already
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.260]   and once you get to a SEAL team,
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.320]   you've got people that are generally speaking
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.560]   gonna be pretty resilient
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.980]   when it comes to dealing with a loss.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.660]   Not only that, I mean, you just get used to,
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.400]   you talk about losing people.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.800]   You're friends with this guy.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.360]   You meet this guy in SEAL training.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.940]   Hey, this guy seems like a stud.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.340]   Oh, he's just gonna quit.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.140]   And you're gonna lose five, six, seven people, eight people.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.920]   People quit so fast, you don't even keep track of them.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.840]   So you're just gonna lose.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.240]   You're just gonna get used to it.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   So there's that.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.760]   Now, once you're in the teams
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.000]   and what you're talking about is now you start taking
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.680]   much more significant loss.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.460]   You're not losing a race, you're losing one of your friends.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.940]   And this is what, from a leadership perspective,
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.500]   you have to pay attention to.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.780]   So when you're a leader in any organization,
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.840]   you're basically in charge of a mob.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.000]   When it comes to what their morale is,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.540]   they're a mob and they feed off of each other
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.440]   just like a mob rioting in the streets going,
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.240]   oh, we can break this window, let's break all the windows.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.520]   And they move this mob mentality.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.140]   And that happens with morale inside of a team.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.260]   And you as a leader can't get caught up with the mob.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.420]   You can't let that happen.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.340]   You have to detach yourself from the mob mentally
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.720]   so that you don't get caught up in their emotions
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.480]   and their morale because if you get caught up
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.520]   in their emotions and you get caught up in their morale,
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.960]   you can't correct it.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.200]   So we go out on a mission.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.080]   The mission goes great.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.260]   We get into a gunfight, kill a couple of bad guys.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.460]   Everyone's okay, high fives, everyone's feeling great.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.840]   You come back to base,
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.800]   hey, we don't need to debrief, that was perfect.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.160]   Hey, we don't need to get our gear maintained.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.540]   We can just go to bed, we're awesome.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.760]   That's when the leader has to say,
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.800]   oh, we've got the mob and the mob is becoming
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.440]   slightly arrogant.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.420]   Hey guys, real quick, that was a good op,
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.680]   but there's some things we could improve on.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.760]   You gotta bring that mob back
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760]   and bring them back to center line.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.280]   Same thing in the other direction.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.140]   You go out on an operation, it doesn't go well.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.280]   You go out on an operation, you take casualties.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.480]   Now you come back to base, you see guys moping around,
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.040]   you see the spirit starting to break and same thing.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:16.180]   If you're part of that mob, you'll be with them.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.560]   Your morale will be breaking, your spirit will be breaking.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.700]   You gotta look at them and say, oh, I see what's happening.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.960]   Hey guys, listen up.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.160]   That was tough, didn't go the way we wanted it to go.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.760]   We need to learn some lessons.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.240]   Here's some things I can do better.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.560]   What can we do better to make sure
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.060]   that that never happens again?
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.680]   What can we do to make sure we have the opportunity
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.920]   to go out and avenge our brother on the battlefield?
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.640]   What can we do to move this thing forward?
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.560]   So as a leader, when it comes to winning and losing,
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.720]   you're generally going to be the person
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.920]   countering what the mob mentality is.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   'Cause when the mob starts winning,
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.860]   they wanna keep winning and they might get arrogant.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.740]   When the mob is losing, they might start to lose more
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.520]   because their attitude goes down the drain.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.120]   So that's what you have to pay attention to
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.360]   from a leadership perspective.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   For me personally, I think, I know what I did
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:16.240]   when I lost guys was focus on, all right,
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.400]   we need to celebrate the life.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   We need to mourn the loss and then we need to go to work.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.480]   We need to get our gear back on.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.080]   We need to lock and load our weapons.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.580]   We need to get back out there.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.460]   I know that that's what we needed to do.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:39.460]   So often, the best way to contend with problems,
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:47.300]   with issues, with adversity is action, is by taking action.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:52.040]   The more you sit and the more you wait
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.440]   and the more time you spend with that adversity,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.980]   with the upper hand inside your head,
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.220]   the worse it's gonna get.
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:04.220]   So for me, always taking action, making something happen.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.820]   It doesn't have to be huge.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.520]   It doesn't have to be some mammoth triumph
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.800]   that you're gonna go and pursue.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.980]   But if you say, hey, listen, this is what happened.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.000]   Didn't go the way we wanted it to.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:19.900]   We're gonna get our gear back on.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.880]   We're gonna go back out.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.800]   We're gonna do this other mission.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.220]   And that's what I think.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:28.820]   I think taking action, and it's in your personal life too,
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.500]   something doesn't go the way you wanted it to go.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.760]   You didn't get the job you wanted.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.600]   You didn't get the hire.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.980]   You didn't get the promotion.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.060]   You can go home and sit there and dwell on it.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.420]   That's not getting you any progress.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.140]   Or you say, okay, you know what?
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.060]   Let me do a quick analysis.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.240]   Why didn't I get that promotion?
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.640]   Oh, it's 'cause I didn't get this qualification
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:48.180]   or I hadn't jumped through this gate.
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.020]   Okay, cool.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:49.840]   What do I need?
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.620]   Let me look into how do I get to jump through that gate
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:52.780]   so next time I will get the promotion
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.260]   and you start taking action.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.440]   So action for me is a cure for a lot of problems
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.440]   that we have in life.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.780]   - I love this because the image that's arising in my mind,
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.380]   I'll share it with you and tell me where it agrees with
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.140]   and maybe violates what you're telling me.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.580]   But what I was imagining when you were talking
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:14.260]   about leadership in the mob is a bunch of candles,
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.420]   but not wax candles.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.820]   These are oil candles.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.740]   You're talking about a win.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.460]   So it could be an op, go out and win.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.300]   It could be a team.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.680]   It could be an individual taking an exam
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.640]   and they get an A plus.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.720]   So it doesn't matter.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.820]   But they're riding high.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.340]   I mean, those winds we know crank up those catecholamines
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:32.180]   and it's as if the intensity that flame starts going up
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.860]   as a consequence, that's natural,
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.100]   but the oil in the candle is continuing to burn down.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.460]   Like you need to celebrate winds,
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.320]   but you're burning that oil.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.640]   And so what we're really talking about here
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.960]   is how to moderate and then reclaim energy.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.940]   And I was imagining you as the leader who's like,
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:49.680]   okay guys, great, but listen, you're burning that oil.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.980]   Right, that oil is what got you the win.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.700]   Let's not just clamp it like we can do a few fist bumps
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.340]   and maybe celebrate in some other ways,
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.780]   but then let's take the energy we got
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.920]   and put it to the next thing rather than just go crazy.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.640]   Drugs of abuse, in particular,
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.600]   drugs that tap into the dopamine system,
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.100]   namely cocaine and amphetamine.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.520]   And just 'cause there's no way to avoid this
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.540]   if we're being true to the biology,
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.460]   the energy, the dopamine system was designed for foraging
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.500]   for all sorts of things.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.580]   Food, so people that overindulge food or seek out food.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.940]   Sex, people that overindulge in these things.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.340]   Those things, and again, this sort of leans
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.740]   to Eastern philosophy a bit,
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.140]   but there's Western neuroscience or neuroscience,
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.820]   we should just say, to support it.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.300]   You start to deplete these dopamine systems.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.220]   The baseline starts to drop.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.620]   And so I'm imagining that the leader, you in this case,
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.940]   is saying like, listen, let's tone it down,
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.240]   use the energy that we've gained and put it to good use
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.500]   rather than just burn it up, enjoying it.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.820]   And then of course, after a loss when those,
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.980]   I sort of think of the candles going dimmer,
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.760]   but the oil reserve is still there.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.360]   It's like, how do you start to tap back
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.280]   into the oil reserve?
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.900]   Well, you have to actually ramp the candle up again.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.360]   You can't just sit there waiting
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.840]   for the intensity of the flame to come back.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.040]   You actually have to do something
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:04.940]   in order for that to happen.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.640]   So maybe this isn't the best analogy
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.880]   'cause it lacks sort of like exactly
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.760]   what is the person turning the intensity
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.180]   up and down on these candles, but that's what comes to mind.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.240]   And in Eastern traditions,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.960]   there's this idea of chi, of energy.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.880]   Energy to fight, energy to seek mates,
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.200]   energy to seek food, energy for sex, energy for all of it
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.360]   is the same energy.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.820]   And I actually believe that the energy
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.160]   that they're referring to are these catecholamines.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.000]   I really do.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.300]   Now there are other energy systems too,
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.040]   relating to child rearing, pair bonding, oxytocin,
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.120]   all the kind of like fuzzy, warm stuff
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.460]   that's super important.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.240]   I mean, we wouldn't exist as a species the way we do
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.080]   if we didn't honor that energy system also.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.040]   And that energy system that we normally think of as love,
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.240]   as opposed to forward center of mass,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.040]   synergizes with this system, right?
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.000]   When you're working with and training with
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.780]   and people that you love, this could be your brothers,
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.480]   your sisters, whatever, your family,
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.820]   there is, I think there's an amplifying effect
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.140]   on this whole thing, right?
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.280]   If it's just for more dopamine, just for more money,
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.280]   just for more wins, just for more trophies.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.120]   I'll never forget this.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.080]   As an aside, when I was a kid, I had this weird experience
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.440]   where Tony Hawk's dad rescued me
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.960]   from a skateboard contest in Linda Vista,
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.840]   the Linda Vista Boys Club.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.680]   Everyone else left.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.640]   I was left there alone.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.040]   I was 14 because of my home life at that time, et cetera.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.880]   And he was like, "Where are you going?"
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.440]   And I'm like, "I'm gonna take the bus to Lancaster.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.280]   I know this guy."
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.240]   And he was like, "No, no, you're coming to our house."
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.080]   I was like, "Okay."
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.840]   So he took me to Tony's house and I went into Tony's room
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.920]   that he had grown up in.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.880]   Tony lived in Fallbrook at that time.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.200]   And the room wasn't filled with trophies.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.840]   The room was trophies.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.280]   And I remember just thinking like, "Holy cow."
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.920]   And when I think about that and I think about
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.880]   what a healthy person Tony turned out to be,
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.040]   'cause I happened to be blessed to know him a little bit,
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.680]   it's amazing 'cause a lot of people
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.000]   that had those trophies, whatever domain of life,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.800]   they converted all that into ways to just burn the oil down
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.620]   in their candle.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.020]   He's a guy who's still going in his 50s, right?
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.320]   So, hey man, that's a little aside story,
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.660]   but I think this notion of energy to me is so important
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.520]   because as you said, when we move toward action
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.940]   and we complete something,
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.520]   the oil in that candle starts to get replenished
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.720]   and the flame burns hotter.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.360]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.440]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.920]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.440]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.080]   to help you better understand your body
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.920]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.580]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.000]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.600]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.680]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.220]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.740]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.500]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.280]   Inside Tracker solves that problem
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.600]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.620]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.460]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.060]   you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.200]   of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids,
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.840]   and other things that impact your immediate
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.200]   and long-term health to bring those numbers
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.980]   into the ranges that are appropriate
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.840]   and indeed optimal for you.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.240]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.800]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.480]   - What you're talking about,
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.600]   and I'm very interested in this now,
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.240]   and I don't know if this has already been measured or not,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.520]   but what essentially we're talking about
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.720]   is the confidence level, right?
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.720]   So if I go out and win, I feel good about it.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.600]   And let's say I'm doing a jiu-jitsu tournament
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.800]   and the first match I go out there
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.280]   and I submit the guy in 30,
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.220]   take him down, submit him in 30 seconds, I'm feeling good.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.200]   I'm feeling like confident, right?
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.520]   So what does that mean?
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.280]   My dopamine is up 'cause I got that victory.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.400]   My testosterone is up 'cause I got that victory.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.600]   My confidence is up 'cause I got that victory.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.000]   Same thing, other direction.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.400]   If I go out first match and I lose to somebody,
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.600]   my dopamine goes down, that chemical thing goes down,
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.980]   my confidence goes down.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:59.840]   And what I have to do is I have to learn
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.400]   how to maintain a level of confidence
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.720]   because if I get over, if I win that first match,
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.640]   win the second match, I'm gonna kill this next guy
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.360]   and I go out and I'm sloppy and I don't care.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.280]   That's when I get caught.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.360]   If I get total, if I lack confidence,
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.660]   I go out there and there's nothing I'm able to do
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.400]   to beat this guy that's gonna be horrible.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.280]   Of course, I'm gonna get smashed.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.660]   So it's a similar thing that we're talking about.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:25.420]   I just wonder how much if you start measuring,
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.560]   'cause they say, hey, if you win,
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.500]   your testosterone goes up, right?
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.280]   And then if you win more, your testosterone goes up high,
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.000]   your dopamine goes up high, your confidence is going up.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.640]   But you can get to a point
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.120]   where your confidence is too high
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.860]   and now you're getting sloppy and now you don't care.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.800]   And you mentioned cocaine.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.880]   You see like videos of people that are all coked up
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.720]   and they, hey, I can do this.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   They think they can do everything.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.320]   - All possibility. - They're overconfident, right?
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.120]   They're over, they think they can kick your ass, I'll fight.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.080]   That's like too much dopamine, too much ego,
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.480]   too much confidence.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.760]   The other side of the spectrum is someone
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.960]   that's on some kind of downer drug
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.580]   and they don't feel like they can do anything.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.680]   They're lethargic, their confidence is low
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.180]   and they're just depressed.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:09.180]   So there's an interesting tie in between dopamine, ego,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.000]   confidence and probably testosterone
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.040]   that you get from winning and from losing.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.000]   And once again, as a leader, from a leadership perspective,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.360]   you can't get wrapped up in that.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.620]   You can't get wrapped up in that.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.880]   You have to detach from it.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.280]   You have to be able to take a step back.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.800]   And then if you're good, even as a competitor,
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.240]   you'll say, oh yeah, that last match was easy,
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.280]   but I need to prepare for the next match.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.840]   I can't bring overconfidence.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.200]   Look, I don't want a lack of confidence.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.040]   It's a balance, right?
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.740]   It's that flame on the oil burning lamp
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.000]   that you're talking about.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.580]   You want that steady flame.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.600]   You don't want too much getting to burn out of control.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.880]   You don't want too little, the flame will go out.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.160]   - Yeah, earlier we talked about this notion
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.900]   that some of these older Hungarian psychologists had,
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.520]   which this notion of generators versus projectors.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.280]   And their idea was that people sort of divide
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.360]   into these different categories and the world needs both.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.480]   It's not that one is better than the other,
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.500]   but the world absolutely needs both.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.920]   And there is this idea now, based on some neuroscience
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.160]   and some other psychology that I've been kind of
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.520]   laving into, which is that generators
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.000]   know how to tap into the system and they love this system.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.240]   I think back to your story about being taken
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.960]   to shop for pants and it turns out to be a trip to shop
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.620]   for a number of different experiences for you, right?
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.720]   A really telling experience, having an action effect
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.200]   on the world and something coming back to you
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.600]   that still sits with you inside.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.220]   In fact, there's a dopamine circuit there still related
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.780]   to this young woman or then young woman at that time.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.940]   Some people are generators and I think that they
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.020]   are more attuned to this dopamine system.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.180]   And so as we're having this conversation,
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.380]   I'm guessing that about the estimate is that
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.800]   somewhere between 50 and 65% of people are going,
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.900]   yeah, I get it.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:57.820]   More workouts is going to give me more energy.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.820]   I need to do more of that.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.640]   I need to, when I'm back on my heels,
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.800]   I need to think about the things I can complete, et cetera.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   And then the other 45% or so, 35% might be saying,
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.280]   I don't really get it.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.320]   Now the idea is that the projectors
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.240]   can tap into these same circuits.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.320]   Everyone has these catecholamine circuits, dopamine, et cetera
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.120]   but that they tend to be more of observers in the world
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.840]   and they like being partnered with
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.600]   and symbiotic with these people.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.440]   Now this starts to take on kind of like
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.400]   stereotypical masculine feminine things
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.860]   but this exists on both sides, it really does.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.660]   There might be some biases, right?
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.700]   By biological sex, there may not be, right?
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.540]   We could argue that.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.180]   It's probably an argument that'll get us into more trouble
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.380]   than to answers and it doesn't really matter.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.540]   The point is that some people are perfectly happy
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.180]   to be in the company of people winning
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.140]   because they feel good to see other people winning.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.580]   They like to be a support staff.
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.140]   That's what makes them feel good.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:53.420]   Other people would rather stick hot forks in their eyes
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.180]   than not be the person engaged in the activity.
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.900]   Maybe not every activity but the activity.
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.700]   So we're talking about the generators and the projectors.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:05.640]   I think that in the context of moderating these systems,
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.620]   it's so key.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.240]   I mean, it's key to have a long arc in a career path,
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.920]   military science or otherwise.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.560]   I think it's key in every domain of life
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.700]   and I think for me, one thing that I've learned
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.680]   both the hard way and I've also benefit
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:23.280]   from the positive experience of, I think in relationships,
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.080]   this could be romantic relationships but also friendships
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:31.080]   and in family, because there are generators and projectors
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.980]   almost always in those kind of symbiotic relationship,
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.680]   romantic couple or a family that some kids
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.260]   are more generators, some are more projectors
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:41.980]   just by something, who knows?
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.580]   Maybe it's hardwired, maybe not.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.860]   As the leader of your family,
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.100]   I'm gonna assume one of the two leaders
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.420]   but as a leader in your family,
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.060]   I'm not gonna make any assumptions here,
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:56.060]   as the leader of your family and also as a father
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.300]   in particular, how do you apply these same sorts of ideas
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.220]   when your kid is kind of down because it's hard
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.740]   to be a 14 year old or because it was a bad day
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:08.660]   or when they're up, right?
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.100]   I think the up states are as interesting as the down states,
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.580]   like yes, like got the degree, got the win.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.340]   How much do you let them celebrate before you're like,
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:20.260]   hey listen, you just got yourself another couple milliliters
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.500]   of oil in your candle, what are you gonna do with that?
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500]   You gonna burn it or are you gonna save it
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.700]   for the next thing so you can climb the staircase?
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.020]   - Well, clearly it's a very similar thing
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.460]   to what I just talked about.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:35.580]   If your kid is doing well and wins the wrestling tournament
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.780]   and is like, yeah, I won the wrestling tournament
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:38.620]   and what do they wanna do?
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.060]   They wanna eat a triple cheese pizza, right?
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:44.740]   I mean, they wanna go crazy and you as a leader
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:48.140]   and as a parent and as a friend need to say,
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.520]   hey man, I mean, you did good, that was awesome,
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:54.300]   you had a great day but let's start thinking a little bit
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.380]   about next week too, how about we just have a few slices
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.540]   of pizza, right, as a reward.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:03.540]   So this is the same in any situation that you could be in
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.720]   interacting with other human beings.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:09.620]   You want to be the person that kind of modulates
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:13.260]   the confidence and the ego or the way you put it,
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:17.180]   the dopamine and the celebratory activities.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.900]   So no matter who you are and this goes with yourself as well
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.380]   you do something, you have a success and you say,
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:28.360]   oh, that's great but all glory is fleeting
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.820]   and I need to get back to work.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.300]   And look, and do people go too far with that sometimes?
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.980]   Yes, absolutely, sometimes people they don't stop
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.100]   and celebrate at all and those are the kind of people
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.660]   I think they get burned out eventually
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.720]   because they never say, hey, that was awesome,
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.580]   we had a big win, cool, high five.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.820]   They don't even say that.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.940]   So I think as a leader, as a friend, as a parent,
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.820]   as a spouse, you wanna be able to modulate that,
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.860]   help modulate that, don't shut it down.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:00.140]   Your kid walks off the wrestling mat for a high five
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.020]   and you say, you could have won by more.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.780]   No, I'm not talking about that.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.780]   Or your kid walks off the mat after losing,
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.000]   you say, you got what you deserve.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.700]   No, you've gotta be the counter, the counterweight
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.240]   to the emotions that other people have.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:16.260]   And I think that when you're doing a good job as a leader,
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.820]   as a friend, as a spouse or whatever,
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.020]   you're doing a good job as a counterweight.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:22.000]   I think that's a good way to look at it.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.260]   You wanna provide some balance for people
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:25.880]   to make sure that they don't get out of control.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.380]   And you notice when people have a downfall,
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.760]   it's normally because they've surrounded themselves
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.500]   with people that there's no counter to,
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.140]   there's no counterbalance.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.360]   If you were my best friend and I went out drinking last night
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.900]   and had a great time and partied all night and met a girl
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.420]   and you're like, heck yeah, let's do it again tonight.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:46.540]   Eventually, where are we gonna be?
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.920]   We're gonna be in the gutter somewhere.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.540]   But if you say, hey, dude, that was awesome,
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.120]   but hey, remember, we got school on Monday, right?
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.840]   And you kinda pull me back.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.080]   We gotta find balance in life and ourselves.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:58.760]   And then we gotta, as much as we can,
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.480]   provide balance for other people
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.360]   because people are emotional
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.960]   and they get caught up in what they're doing
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.680]   and you wanna keep people balanced.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.840]   - I think one of the reasons people
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.000]   are really drawn to your message,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.440]   and I put myself in that category.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.600]   I remember 2014 was a very different picture for me.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.160]   It doesn't really matter what the contour was,
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.800]   but things were working,
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.300]   but they weren't working the way I wanted them to.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.800]   And I remember arriving at your content first
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.960]   through the Tim Ferriss podcast,
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.420]   then eventually the Jocko Willing podcast,
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.440]   Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.100]   Those were the big two ones
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.500]   that kinda introduced me to you and your content.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.460]   And it was really a case of,
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:37.240]   at the time, I didn't have a lot of friends
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.520]   that were doing similar things to me
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.240]   or that matched my daily routines
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.440]   in a way that I could kinda synergize with in this way.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:49.180]   I think one reason why you are so helpful to people
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:52.480]   is that not everybody has these friends.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.320]   You can have the friend that's like,
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.100]   "Let's go out and tie one on again."
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.980]   A lot of people don't even have that friend.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:57.820]   Or they have a friend,
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:00.880]   but they're not really close with that person.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.620]   There's some ideas nowadays about like,
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.740]   80% of males don't have a close friend that they could call.
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.580]   I don't know.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.700]   I mean, I'm guessing girls and women feel the same too,
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.620]   that a lot of stuff is superficial.
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.140]   And there's a lot of communication,
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.540]   but not a lot of connection, right?
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.800]   And so I think that you and a few other people
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.560]   in the, let's call it social media, public facing space,
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.920]   serve as archetypes of like,
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.280]   the friend that's gonna tell you when you're up,
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.140]   great, but let's clamp it after a while.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.000]   Or that when you're down, let's get going,
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.220]   and here's how you get going.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.880]   And so I do wanna highlight that
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.240]   because I think it's really important.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.640]   But one reason why people are drawn to your message
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.960]   and the message of some other people
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.520]   who are out there trying to do similar things,
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.680]   but you in particular, because yes,
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.200]   you have this military background,
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.420]   very intense military background, wartime background,
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:53.260]   but also you bring it into the daily routines
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.440]   that certainly apply to everybody.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.020]   You know, most everybody can access non-heated water, right?
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:23:59.860]   One would hope.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:03.000]   There's another dimension to this
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.280]   that I want to just bring up and get your reflections on
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.360]   as it relates to military, work, school, relationship,
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.960]   family, et cetera, which is this somewhat
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.200]   counterintuitive idea, but then once you hear it,
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.440]   it makes perfect sense, which is that
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.140]   even though the catecholamines are responsible for drive
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.660]   and that that's what we're really about
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.980]   when we're forward center of mass
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.540]   and we have to control the level,
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.560]   the intensity of the candle and the level of the oil,
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.680]   and I don't know what those actually map to exactly.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.320]   We could probably figure it out if we really parsed it,
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:37.320]   but that's the idea here, the analogy.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.720]   In a kind of surprising way, we know that for sure
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.000]   one way to restore levels of motivation, drive,
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.640]   enthusiasm, and to some degree confidence
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.800]   that things could be different is through deep rest,
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.240]   things like sleep, right?
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.440]   When things are really, really hard,
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.220]   when kids are just like, they were like falling apart,
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.680]   you know, it's like you put them to sleep,
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.040]   they wake up and they're like delightful.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.220]   They're like running around their pajamas
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.160]   when they're little and a teenager wakes up
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.000]   after a good night's sleep.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.320]   They might be a little like surly,
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.800]   but we're back, adults are like this.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.780]   The world is falling apart.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.680]   You go to sleep, wake up, okay,
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.980]   I might be able to manage this kind of mindset.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:22.680]   So sleep, and then the other one is we know that play,
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.400]   the sort of the kind of physical activity
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.580]   or mental activity where it might be a little competitive,
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.240]   but the stakes are low.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.500]   And it's really more about connection with the activity
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.800]   or connection with somebody else.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.920]   Like we're gonna play a game of whatever.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.440]   You know, I won't play chess with Lex
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.280]   'cause he'll kick my ass.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.440]   I won't do jiu-jitsu with either of you
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.680]   'cause you'll beat me up.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.840]   Both of you, kindly, but you'll do it.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.920]   But you know, like if we were to play a game,
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.680]   it's just us, yeah, we might be a little competitive,
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.800]   but the stakes are low, right?
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.400]   We know that play and social connection and sleep
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.760]   are basically the reservoir or the location
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.920]   that you go to refill the oil and the candle
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.640]   every single time.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.880]   And so for you, where do those things
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.960]   play into your routine?
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.720]   You know, you mentioned you can go hard all day
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.920]   and then in the evening, is it dinner with family,
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.200]   typically if you're at home?
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.120]   And what does that look like?
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.240]   I know we're kind of parsing into,
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.920]   I don't wanna carve into your personal life too deeply.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.560]   Obviously there are boundaries there,
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.800]   but what does that look like?
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.440]   Is it everyone at the table phones away
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.080]   and you're talking about the day?
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.160]   Or is it, you know, yeah, share with us a little bit
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:27.980]   of what that looks like.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.660]   'Cause I think it is an important contour
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.280]   to what you're about and what we're talking about
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.600]   that most people just don't have a window into.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.080]   - Yeah, so first of all, I mean,
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.840]   just the refilling the tank with games.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.440]   I mean, that's what jiu-jitsu is, right?
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.640]   You're gonna go and you're gonna have
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.440]   social connection with people.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440]   You're gonna talk to people that you know.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.400]   You're gonna joke about whatever.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.240]   Then you're gonna roll.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.920]   You're gonna have a good time rolling.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.080]   You're gonna get a little sweat on.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:52.900]   You're gonna feel good.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:53.800]   Then you're gonna high five.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.440]   Like there's huge, that's there.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.040]   And your brain is kind of off, you know,
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.560]   when you're training jiu-jitsu at a certain level,
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.220]   you're not gonna be thinking anymore.
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.060]   Same thing with surfing.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.160]   You go surfing and you catch a wave.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.200]   I mean, you're not thinking about,
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.480]   oh, I need to put my balance over here.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.200]   No, it's happening and you're having a good time.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.420]   So I would say that restoration for me
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.640]   comes from those two things for sure.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.540]   And then, yeah, I mean, my wife and my kids,
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.840]   when I get home, my kids are older now.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.360]   And they're out of the house, except for one.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000]   And when I was in the Navy, when they were young,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.280]   I wasn't around at all.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.820]   You know, there wasn't any,
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.660]   like we would rarely have dinner together
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:40.500]   'cause I was gone, coming home late.
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.720]   You're working all the time.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.400]   You can never get all your work done.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.660]   I'm training jiu-jitsu.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:49.420]   Like it was, we rarely ate dinner as a family
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.780]   when I was in the teams.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:55.120]   And now when I'm home and we can eat together, for sure.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.960]   You know, my daughter that's still at home,
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.240]   she's gonna, you know, we sit out there
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.600]   and eat dinner and talk about just normal things
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.920]   that people talk about.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.280]   Like, you know, how to conduct a night ambush
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.960]   or, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.840]   Let's talk about normal, normal, you know,
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.000]   daily things and what's going on.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.300]   And, you know, my daughter that's, she's 13 right now.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.360]   And she talks to me about all kinds of stuff, you know?
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.400]   And it's awesome.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.680]   Yeah, I'm definitely enjoying that aspect
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.720]   of being around more than I was when I was in the teams.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.200]   And I just, we didn't have dinner.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.240]   We didn't happen.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:39.440]   So I would take my kids to jiu-jitsu.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.320]   I taught jiu-jitsu classes when I could
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.580]   when I was in the teams.
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:45.880]   Would do like workouts with them in the morning
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:48.260]   if I had time, on the weekends for sure.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.920]   Stuff like that with my kids.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.240]   That's kind of what I did.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:56.640]   But now, yeah, we, my wife is awesome.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.460]   And she is a great cook now
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:04.540]   because when we first got married, it was questionable.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.320]   I just was harassing her about this the other day.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   Like she, she got, she's an unbelievable cook now.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.360]   And it's awesome.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.600]   And when we first met, by her own admission,
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.120]   she will tell you she was not, she's from England, right?
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.600]   And so they're just not cooking what we're liking.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.400]   - No, the food over there, at least when I was growing up
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.640]   and the few times I made it over there,
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.200]   the food was pretty dreadful.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.560]   I mean, there were some exceptions to that, but,
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.360]   and they drank a lot over there.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.720]   So I've been to some scientific meetings over there
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.280]   where they would start with like sherry in the afternoon
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.280]   and then beer after work.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.440]   And it was outrageous.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.360]   I mean, the amount of alcohol intake was just absurd.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.200]   Sorry, Brits.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.760]   And again, I'm not trying to, I did an episode on alcohol.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.280]   A lot of people were angry about that episode
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.120]   because it basically said,
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.560]   once you get past two drinks a week,
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.760]   you're starting to head into territory
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.200]   that can deplete your health.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.000]   So you gotta do a lot of other things to offset it,
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.480]   but they drink a lot.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.960]   - Yeah, the Brits drink a lot.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.920]   I have spent time over there with my father-in-law,
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.200]   my brother-in-law, and we definitely drank a lot.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.760]   So I'm glad I don't live there and had to drink with them.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:13.240]   I'm glad I don't have to drink with them all the time.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.600]   I'd probably be dead.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.660]   - You were straight edge growing up, right?
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:18.360]   - Yeah, I mean, when I was a kid
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.920]   and then when I joined the Navy, I started drinking.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.540]   That's like part of the culture that I bought into.
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:29.160]   And you don't like, I wanted to be a good seal
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.060]   and I'm looking around at the guys
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.240]   that were considered good seals.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.080]   - Oh.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:34.900]   - So we're drinking.
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:36.640]   Okay, that's what we're doing.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.440]   And that's what I did.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:45.560]   I think my looking back now, I didn't really,
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:48.540]   I didn't think of it as a big deal at the time.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:49.940]   I wasn't like, well, first of all,
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:53.380]   even when I was growing up and I didn't drink
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:56.080]   and didn't smoke, didn't do drugs,
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:58.820]   I wasn't like a guy putting an X on my hand,
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:02.460]   although my friends and I, we all didn't drink, didn't smoke.
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:04.420]   So we definitely, look, I was listening to my input
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:06.860]   when I was a kid, I mean, I get it.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.260]   But I wasn't a guy running around
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.500]   telling everyone I was straight edge, you know?
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.860]   But I was on that path for sure.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.780]   And then when I got in the seal teams,
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.080]   it's like, okay, this is a different culture.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:18.920]   I'm not used to it.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:22.640]   I didn't really even understand what drinking was.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.840]   I mean, I'd never, I never had been drunk.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.620]   So got in the seal teams, I was like, okay, well, you know,
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:31.940]   once I turned 21, okay, this is, hey, these guys,
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:33.020]   we're gonna have fun.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.940]   And I kind of just, okay, that's what we're doing.
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.380]   And then I drank a ton while I was in the seal teams.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:42.780]   And then as I, man, I retired from the seal teams
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:47.540]   and went out, we basically went to every bar
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:51.440]   that we would normally go to as seals.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.280]   I think we closed out the night at the pack shores in OB.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.820]   And went home that morning, I woke up the next morning,
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:02.040]   worked out, and then I just kind of stopped drinking
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.640]   because, and now I just definitely, I mean,
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.480]   now I just don't really drink anymore.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.920]   So that's that.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.920]   - Yeah, when I had my lab in San Diego for five years,
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.940]   that's where my lab started.
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:17.580]   I definitely saw a lot of team guys in bars.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:20.140]   You guys would come in and take over bars.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.100]   These were literal takeovers.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.100]   You basically, I wouldn't leave
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.280]   'cause I wouldn't like give them the satisfaction
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.860]   or me the dissatisfaction, but it was a little frustrating.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.620]   You know, you're in there, you're having a decent time,
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.900]   and then just this enormous pack of team guys comes in
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.140]   and sort of like, all right,
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.060]   maybe it's time to close out the night, you know?
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.660]   Sometimes I was friends with enough of them that, you know,
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.100]   but if you're not really a part of it,
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.060]   you're not really a part of it.
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.420]   And I always knew that and understood that.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.060]   One thing that I think really comes through now especially,
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.220]   but throughout our discussion
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.260]   and all the things I've seen of you,
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:54.060]   and it gets me back to this thing
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.820]   that came up at the beginning I'd really like to return to,
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:00.820]   is that you seem to have a very strong sense
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.780]   of context and self.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.220]   I'll just say it, I'm not a psychologist.
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.500]   I'm not here to play one, but you know,
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.940]   what you just described was that, okay, in one context,
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.660]   you know, it made sense to be straight edge.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.220]   I mean, you mentioned Minor Threat, great band,
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.620]   straight edge band, but when it came time to,
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.940]   you know, you run around with your friends then
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.380]   and it made sense to be, you know,
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.460]   without alcohol or drugs or anything at that stage.
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.900]   And then you get into another context.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.300]   It's like, okay, I can do this.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:26.780]   I can drink and still perform well
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.780]   and do all the things I need to do.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.940]   And then when that closes out,
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:32.060]   I'm going to do something else.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.500]   And some people are like that
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.820]   because they're kind of a chameleon, right?
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:38.460]   They're switching themselves depending on the context
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.400]   and they're kind of getting accents
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.140]   when they're in one location or another,
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.420]   but that's not you at all.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.100]   I can tell with certainty that's not you at all,
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:49.980]   that there seems to be a very strong sense of self
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:53.660]   so that when we have a sense of self that's firm,
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.140]   we can go into different contexts.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.440]   We can even change our behavior,
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.220]   but we don't lose who we are,
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:33:59.860]   which means we can always return to it.
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:02.140]   The image in my mind is like,
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:04.160]   I've done a little bit of scuba diving, not a lot,
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.780]   but during some of the more advanced training for us,
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.020]   sorry, this wasn't SEAL training, of course,
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.380]   was, you know, following a line in the dark,
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.820]   like a night dive, and you're following a line.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.540]   And, you know, sometimes you're navigating with tools,
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.580]   but sometimes you're following a line underwater.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.120]   And this idea that like, you can let go of that line,
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.380]   but you remember where it is, you can return to it.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:23.180]   And that's kind of how I imagine the sense of self
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.700]   because in different contexts,
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.660]   most healthy people modify themselves a little bit.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.660]   We act differently at a wedding or a funeral
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:32.060]   than we do in class or out, you know, with our friends.
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.980]   Of course, it's an important part of being a human,
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.240]   a functional human.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.820]   So it seems to me that from a pretty early stage,
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.160]   you had a pretty good sense of self.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.520]   Now, I don't know if you sit in your room and meditate
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.000]   on like, who is Jocko Willink and like touch that,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.480]   that central cord of self, I'm guessing you don't.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.660]   But as I say this, I have to ask,
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.700]   was there something in your upbringing, your parents,
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:58.700]   or was it just kind of how you always imagined yourself
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:00.560]   as like, yeah, this is who I am.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.920]   Like, no matter what happens around me,
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.480]   like I kind of know who I am.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.200]   Even if I'm engaging in some of the behaviors
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.700]   that I might not do in another concept,
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:08.540]   I know who I am.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.860]   'Cause I actually think that many people
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.180]   do not have a very firm sense of self
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:17.180]   or their sense of self is so rigid
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.700]   that they can only operate in this like narrow trench
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:23.260]   of one domain of life and they end up very, very isolated.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.900]   So I'd love for you to kind of share with us
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.260]   what your recollections are kind of like
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:28.840]   the first time you realized kind of like,
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.620]   yeah, like I'm good in a bunch of different places.
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.740]   I'm safe or I'm whatever.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.040]   'Cause I think this also relates to confidence.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.380]   - You know, I'm glad you are giving me
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.940]   the benefit of the doubt on going in the teams
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:47.300]   and being like, oh, hey man, it looks like guys are drinking
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.560]   and I haven't really drank before.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.220]   And it seems like these guys are having a good time.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.420]   Let's go have a good time with these guys.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.260]   And that's kind of what I did, right?
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:36:00.060]   As far as, and you know, I look at it now
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.940]   and unfortunately for me, you know,
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.820]   I look at alcohol now as just,
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:08.060]   I've seen it destroy so many people
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:11.420]   that I've now kind of look at it and go,
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:14.620]   man, I don't think people should drink.
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:15.720]   And look, I get it.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.760]   I'm kind of an example.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.400]   Like I used to drink and go out and have a good time
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.240]   and it wasn't that big of a deal.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.160]   It didn't negatively impact me in some dramatic way.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.160]   But I have so many friends that it is horrible for.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.860]   It is all but ruined their lives.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:35.180]   And you know, it's totally legal, which is kind of bizarre.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.940]   So I think that figuring that out when I look back
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.920]   and the culture in the SEAL teams was very,
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.780]   there was very alcohol centric.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.220]   And part of that is because, you know,
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.820]   that you got like, it's just like a fraternity
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:55.680]   is alcohol centric or a football team is out.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.800]   'Cause you've got a bunch of young dudes
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.340]   that are gonna drink and have a good time.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.680]   So it just sort of a young dude kind of thing.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:07.460]   And unfortunately it ends up ruining a lot of people's lives
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:10.060]   and they make bad decisions and they do stupid things
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.860]   and it's just not good.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.620]   And I think the culture is moving away from that
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.180]   a little bit in the SEAL teams.
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:21.820]   You know, my alcohol brief used to say,
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.220]   you know, I used to tell my guys, if you go out,
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.180]   you get a DUI, you get put in jail for a fight,
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.580]   you get hurt because you're doing something drunk,
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.400]   you just did Al-Qaeda's job for them.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.340]   You just did Al-Qaeda's,
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:37.780]   they wanna take you off the battlefield
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.140]   and you just took yourself off the battlefield.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:40.340]   You can't go on deployment now.
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:43.220]   And that would always hit guys.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:45.380]   And I think that that's, you know,
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.840]   the SEAL teams kind of leaning in that direction more,
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.460]   realizing the negativity of alcohol.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.500]   I wish I would have realized that earlier.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.020]   I wish I would have been a better leader
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.940]   and recognize that at an earlier stage
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.300]   and recognize that just because I was kind of getting away
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.980]   with it, meaning it didn't really,
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:05.460]   I didn't wake up in the morning going,
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.300]   man, I can't wait to get drunk.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.160]   I never really had that feeling.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:12.580]   I wish I would have realized that there's other guys that do
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.220]   and you know, there's people that can operate
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.700]   and be functional and it doesn't really impact their lives,
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.980]   but there's a lot of people that don't.
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.940]   And I don't think it's worth the dice roll
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:23.480]   to start drinking.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:24.780]   I just don't think it's worth the dice roll.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.260]   What do you get out of it?
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.060]   So I think that overall, that's why,
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.340]   if when I think about alcohol,
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.340]   I just think about all the lives that it's ruined
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:36.620]   and I don't like it.
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:38.700]   And I wish I would have done a better job of saying,
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.940]   you know what, this is probably not good
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.340]   and we shouldn't do this.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:43.860]   And unfortunately I didn't.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.420]   And I try and convey that message as much as I can now.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.040]   And it did bring me back to my roots
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.260]   because when I was a kid, it was like, alcohol is weak.
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.500]   And you look at these guys,
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.900]   they don't know what they're doing.
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:57.260]   They're acting like idiots.
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:59.260]   I'm not going to be like that.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.260]   And so, you know, as I got older,
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:04.680]   once I got all the SEAL teams, I kind of went back to that.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:09.400]   As far as kind of where I became me,
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.100]   I just actually have to kind of give a lot of credit
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:14.860]   to the music that I grew up listening to
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.360]   and the attitude that we had back then.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.680]   Listening to hardcore music,
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.100]   being able to stand up against what other people were saying,
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:28.540]   which is what you're doing when you're in that scene
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:31.300]   and the whole DIY nature of it.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.660]   Hey, we can just do this ourselves.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.420]   We can just make this happen for ourselves.
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:37.460]   We don't need anybody else.
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.020]   We can do this.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:41.740]   And that hardcore attitude and sticking by your friends
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:43.980]   and standing up and getting in fights
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:45.640]   and like, that's what you're going to do.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.780]   That's kind of my attitude.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:52.540]   And I got interviewed for a documentary
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:54.460]   that they're making about Harley Flanagan
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:56.220]   and the Cro-Mags.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:00.860]   And you know, when I was a kid,
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.900]   and actually through my whole life,
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:05.500]   like that was, that music is the soundtrack to my life.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:08.580]   And so I always would have that music running in my head.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:12.380]   But to your question, I had something in me
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:16.180]   that when I heard that music for the first time,
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.580]   I was like, okay, here it is.
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:19.420]   You know, here it is.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:21.780]   This is, you know, I hear the Beatles.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.140]   I hear the Grateful Dead.
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.460]   I hear the Rolling Stones.
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:25.740]   I hear the whoever.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.860]   And you go, okay, that's fine.
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.400]   But when I heard hardcore music for the first time,
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.180]   when I heard the Cro-Mags, when I heard Agnostic Front,
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.540]   when I heard the Bad Brains,
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:37.500]   I thought it was, that was just like,
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.800]   it was part of me already.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.680]   And then it was the attitude.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.660]   And again, you can listen to my podcast
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.060]   with Harley Flanagan.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.740]   The way I viewed Harley Flanagan,
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.220]   the way I viewed the Cro-Mags
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.820]   was not the way they actually were.
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:54.780]   I mean, you know, Harley was doing drugs.
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:55.940]   I mean, horrible drugs.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.420]   He was on heroin, everything else.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:02.420]   But his image was like straight edge, kind of spiritual.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.640]   They had all that stuff going on.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.860]   And I thought, okay, well, that's what they have.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.860]   I didn't know.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.300]   I'm like a kid living in the woods in Connecticut.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.860]   I'm just kind of hearing what I'm hearing.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.380]   He listened to the lyrics,
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.260]   listened to the lyrics of Minor Threat,
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:16.100]   listened to the lyrics.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.300]   And you go, okay, this stuff, I agree with this stuff.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:24.300]   And I just think that that kind of set a datum in my head
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:30.220]   of being okay with being outside,
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.880]   being okay with saying no,
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.980]   being okay with being a rebel,
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:37.020]   being okay with not going along
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:38.380]   with what everyone else is doing.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:43.060]   And that became very important when I was in the military
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.660]   and I looked at what leadership might be telling me to do
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.500]   and might think to myself,
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.860]   hey, that doesn't seem like a good idea.
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:51.780]   And having the wherewithal to say,
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:53.260]   hey boss, I'm not sure this is a good idea.
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.620]   Not to be a jerk about it,
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.840]   but just to say,
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.020]   there might be a better way to get this done.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:57.860]   What do you think of this?
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:59.700]   Or, hey boss, can I ask you a question about that?
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.620]   So I think if I had to trace it back,
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:06.420]   having black flagged my war side two on my record player
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.940]   for like a year and a half straight,
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:11.260]   that's gonna leave a mark, man.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:12.900]   And I think it left a mark on me.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:16.420]   - I love what you just said.
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:18.180]   And when I say love, I really mean it
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.900]   because as we both know,
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.660]   we share a common love for certain music
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.780]   in particular, Minor Threat
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:25.140]   and some stuff from the punk rock scene.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.220]   In particular for me, the Northeast punk rock scene,
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.140]   the Bruisers, Al Barr from the Bruisers.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:30.300]   Now people know him as the lead singer
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.220]   for the Dropkick Murphys,
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:32.940]   but before that was the Bruisers.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:35.780]   We run the risk of going deep down a rabbit hole of music
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.900]   that most people may or may not be familiar with.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.340]   Although most people have heard of the Dropkicks,
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:41.100]   but yeah, I'm right there with you.
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:42.380]   I mean, I remember the first time hearing
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.380]   Stiff Little Fingers or Rancid
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.180]   and even Bouncing Souls for New Jersey,
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.460]   not even Bouncing Souls, sorry, sorry Brian and Greg.
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:53.820]   No, the Bouncing Souls and going, yes, that.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.940]   That's me, that's it.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.900]   But as you said, it was already kind of in you.
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.260]   It's like a recognition.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:01.060]   And I bring this up and I wanna highlight it
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.940]   not because we share this,
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.540]   although I do find that to be an amazing kinship
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.740]   that we felt right away
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:08.940]   and was like, we could probably riff for 25 hours
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:10.320]   just on that.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.780]   But it brings me back to this idea
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:13.860]   that certainly is not my idea.
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:15.760]   Actually, the first time I heard about it
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.020]   was from Robert Greene who wrote the book Mastery
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.980]   and some important writings, various, what was it?
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:25.140]   I think it was the, I forget how many laws of power,
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:26.700]   but those books, Robert Greene.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.620]   Mastery is actually a book
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.660]   that I highly recommend people read
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.340]   because it talks about mentorship and finding mentors
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.600]   and the fact that we're supposed to break up
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.700]   and move on from mentors
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:36.380]   and that mentors aren't always people that we know
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:39.500]   or that know us, et cetera, amazing book really.
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500]   But he was the first person I ever heard
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:44.040]   describe this idea that if we think back long enough,
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.340]   there's some seed moment,
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:47.020]   maybe it was shopping for the pants, it sounds like it was,
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.420]   but also music where you see something and it's like, yes,
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.400]   that's me and I'm that.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.480]   And then that becomes a sort of soundtrack or visual image
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.680]   or something for your life that you carry forward with you.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.260]   The neuroscientist in me wants to say
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:03.960]   that that is the first time
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:08.400]   that we really tap into this dopamine system
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.160]   in a way that is unique to us
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.660]   because every child responds to food
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:15.220]   with a little bit of dopamine
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:18.060]   when we're hungry, responds to warmth when we're cold,
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:21.740]   responds to a warm, dry diaper after we just wet ourselves,
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.620]   which we all did.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.680]   I don't know, maybe Jocko, you changed your own diapers.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.660]   (laughing)
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.140]   But I'm guessing that someone changed your diaper
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:31.980]   at one point, not an image path we need to go down.
[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:34.580]   But the idea is that we all have these universal sources
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.460]   of kind of having our needs met,
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.600]   going from discomfort to comfort and back again,
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.120]   which is basically childhood.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.300]   But at some point, something comes along
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.180]   that we really feel like is unique to us.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.820]   And it may be the thing that everyone else likes.
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.020]   Maybe it's top 40 or whatever it is.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.700]   Maybe it's the shoe that everyone's wearing
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.060]   and that seems good.
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:54.520]   But I do think that there are certain people
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.200]   who are kind of 10 or 20 or maybe even 180 degrees off
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.380]   from what everyone else likes.
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:02.460]   And they're like, that thing is what's really cool.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.260]   And it's a felt thing.
[01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:07.040]   And so along the lines of felt things,
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.200]   as opposed to things that everyone values,
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.880]   what are your sources of motivation?
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   And I'm going to guess that some of them are internal.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.840]   We could point to head or we could point to heart,
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.640]   doesn't really matter.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.200]   But when you think of sources of motivation,
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.280]   do you have a palette of them that you can dip into?
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.480]   Do you even feel the need to dip into them?
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.520]   Or is it really just all about action steps
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.740]   throughout your day?
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:39.740]   Or if I can even venture into the somewhat harder stories
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.120]   that I've heard you talk about,
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.760]   do you sometimes think back and listen,
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.040]   I'm going to do this because there are a bunch of guys
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.440]   that are dead now that can't.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.060]   And so I'm going to do it because I can.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:53.560]   What are the paints on your motivation palette, if you will?
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:46:02.240]   - Well, you probably heard me say that
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:07.240]   motivation isn't something that I am going to count on
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.020]   because it's just an emotion that's going to come and go.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:14.820]   And it's just like feeling happy.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:15.960]   You feel happy right now,
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.580]   maybe you won't feel happy in 15 minutes.
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.800]   You feel sad now, maybe you won't feel sad in 15 minutes.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.120]   You feel motivated right now,
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.720]   you might not feel motivated in 15 minutes.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.600]   Therefore, I can't rely on it.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.600]   So I'm not going to put any money on just being motivated
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.440]   because it doesn't really matter to me.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:39.440]   So the daily actions that I take aren't from motivation,
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.520]   they're just from discipline.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.480]   Like I said earlier, I'm not going to get up
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.440]   and go through some big debate about,
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.580]   well, really, do I really feel like doing this?
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.420]   No, I don't feel like doing this, but it doesn't matter.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:51.880]   So I'm just going to go do it.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:58.960]   Now, if we start to look at sort of a broader
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.940]   movement through life and continuing to try and move forward
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:13.080]   and move on, you know, my buddy Seth died
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:20.080]   and he was the Delta platoon commander in tasking a bruiser.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:25.080]   And he died in 2017 and it was in a parachute accident.
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:33.280]   And it was, I mean, it's definitely unexpected.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:39.160]   And also he'd already been through multiple deployments,
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.900]   was with us, with me in the Battle of Ramadi.
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:45.560]   He then went back into Sadr City
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.880]   and led a ton of very dangerous operations.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:53.960]   And then he did other deployments
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.540]   and was kind of done with his deployments, kind of done.
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:01.620]   And now he's just talking about when he's going to retire
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:03.880]   and he's a couple of years away from retirement.
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.280]   And, you know, I'm talking about,
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.680]   hey, we're going to work together again.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:11.540]   And it all seems like we're on a pretty good path
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:13.580]   to just move forward.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:17.000]   And then he ends up dying in a parachute accident.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.200]   And he's a guy that, you know, was really just kind of,
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:24.500]   you're not going to be able to replace any,
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:29.380]   any, you can't, there's a uniqueness to him
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:31.440]   that is, you're not going to find.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.480]   And, you know, I've got some stuff that he wrote.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.180]   He was an incredible writer.
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:40.400]   And I'll like try and write something like him.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:44.000]   I can't, we can't do it 'cause he had a bigger vocabulary
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.580]   and a more articulate way of writing.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.480]   And so I can't write anything as well as he wrote it.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.480]   He was incredible at guitar.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:54.360]   He played guitar, played ukulele, like sick,
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:57.320]   like an incredible at playing guitar.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.880]   And he's a total knuckle dragger,
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.720]   like a total meathead knuckle dragger.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:05.320]   You know, his nickname was Unfrozen Caveman
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.440]   because he just, he just, you know,
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.420]   looked like a big caveman.
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:14.240]   And yet he spoke French and, you know,
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.400]   could recite French poetry
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.940]   and was really good at learning languages.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:21.240]   And he was an artist.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.880]   And he had, do you know what synesthesia is?
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.160]   Do you know what that is?
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.360]   - Emerging of the senses.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.280]   So people that can see colors and.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.120]   So he didn't know what it was.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.020]   - Oh, sorry, I see colors.
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:32.480]   I hope most people can see colors.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.000]   Sorry, that can hear colors
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.600]   and can associate particular colors with sound
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.580]   with like particular keys on the piano.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.360]   It's pretty rare.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.420]   Some people think they have it,
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.620]   but true synesthesics are pretty rare,
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.800]   but they don't have to fight for this trait.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.480]   It just kind of emerges for them.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.440]   - He didn't know it.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.800]   But one day he was talking to me
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.360]   and he was embarrassed to tell me.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.640]   He's like, you know, what's weird is
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.440]   when I think of numbers,
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.940]   I have colors in my head.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.240]   And I go, what do you mean?
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.480]   And he says, hollow was zero.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.880]   And I remember seven is yellow.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:09.720]   I don't remember any of them,
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.320]   but he just rattled off like one, two, three,
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.160]   four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.720]   You know, he says, you know, hollow, white, clear,
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.960]   all of, you know, just rattled off these colors.
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.260]   So he had this, he had that synesthesia
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.920]   and it gave him some kind of weird ability
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.240]   to memorize numbers.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:25.400]   So, you know, he'd be in a bar
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.440]   and talk to some girl and he'd say, what's your number?
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440]   And he would just, he would know it for two years.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.880]   He would just know it.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:34.040]   And that also made him incredibly good at playing guitar
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:37.720]   because now like the scale and the fret board of a guitar
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.520]   is this, it's a mathematical thing
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.760]   that he has all in this weird,
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:45.340]   this weird coloration scenario going on.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:50.240]   So there's, so he's this guy and, you know,
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:53.200]   and very, a very emotional guy,
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:56.240]   a very emotional guy who would, you know,
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:59.320]   I was talking earlier about being a balance for someone.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:02.760]   I had to balance this dude out on a daily basis sometimes.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:05.280]   You know, he'd be so mad about something.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.480]   You know, one day he'd be, I hate the teams.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:08.920]   I hate all these guys.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.600]   And I'd say, yeah, I get it, man.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.560]   And the next day, I'm never getting out of the teams.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.280]   You know, he would oscillate that bad.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.520]   And I would tell him, hey, bro, you're oscillating again.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.280]   And just would do anything.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:25.280]   And he loved his guys and would do anything for his guys.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:31.280]   And so when he died, you know,
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:36.800]   we're at his, it's not his funeral.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.840]   It's before the funeral.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:41.560]   It's like the open casket thing, the wake thing.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.560]   And myself, his brother, Alex,
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.680]   Leif Babin, who I wrote "Extreme Ownership" with,
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:55.600]   and JP Dinnell, who's one of my brothers,
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.440]   who works with us at Echelon Front now,
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.200]   is with us in Ramadi and was very close to Seth.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.760]   And we're, like, everyone kind of cleared out for us.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.760]   And we go in there, and I think JP gave him,
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:16.440]   JP had one of those memorial bracelets
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.280]   with guys' names on it that had died,
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.520]   and JP gave that to him.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.160]   And I think Leif gave him some surf wax
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.160]   'cause also Seth was a surfer.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:28.920]   And I gave Seth his black belt
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.880]   'cause he started training jiu-jitsu with me.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.080]   And he had his purple belt.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.200]   He'd gotten his purple belt.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.720]   I gave him his black belt.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.280]   And everyone was just quiet.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:43.640]   And, you know, JP was telling this story the other day.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:50.360]   And I just said, "We will not fail him."
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:53:01.480]   Meaning that him,
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:07.360]   Mark, Mikey, Chris, Seth,
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.680]   and countless other guys,
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:14.160]   they're not here.
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.960]   They don't have the opportunity to do the things we do.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:20.200]   They don't have the opportunity to get up in the morning.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.040]   So,
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:26.400]   that's what it is, man.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:29.920]   I won't fail those guys.
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.920]   - Thanks for sharing that.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:39.800]   Yeah, I think anyone listening to this
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.600]   feels what I feel right now, which is
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.280]   it's very clear that the depth of emotion
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.760]   for people that we care about and lose
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:53.640]   has everything to do with our love for them.
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:55.200]   There's just no question about it, right?
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.360]   That grief and love are so intimately tied.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:02.040]   They are a direct reflection of one another.
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:04.200]   And I, you know,
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.920]   I hesitate to kind of stay on hard themes,
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.520]   but I think it's really important.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.840]   For a couple of reasons.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:17.800]   Last time we spoke, it was in your office
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.880]   and your podcast.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:21.120]   And after we wrapped up,
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:23.240]   we started talking about some people we know
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.280]   and some things that had happened in your community
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.760]   and kind of spooled into some discussions
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.920]   about things that happened in nearby communities
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.160]   and civilian culture.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:36.760]   And, you know, one of the things that's so perplexing,
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.160]   I think, to people,
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:44.160]   including me, but maybe with time less so,
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:49.000]   and this actually came up last night in a discussion at home
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.400]   'cause of some recent events, not close to me,
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.160]   but just that, you know,
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:57.320]   some people go through things where there's loss,
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.120]   they go through life and there's hardship.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.840]   I think most people experience some hardship,
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:03.320]   certainly some more than others.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:08.120]   And every once in a while and far too often,
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.160]   and even in the SEAL team community,
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.780]   and even in the various communities
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:14.920]   within the SEAL team community
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:18.280]   where one would never expect it, all right?
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:23.280]   These are highly trained, tight community, hard guys, right?
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.600]   That's the language we sometimes hear.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.320]   But as you pointed out,
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:31.880]   these are people often that have tremendous emotional depth.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:34.120]   I am so glad that you brought that up
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:39.120]   'cause I think we sometimes think of emotion as weakness,
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:44.620]   but there was a time not long ago, 40, 50 years ago,
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:48.120]   where emotions like jealousy and intensity,
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.720]   think the character Sonny and the Godfather,
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.800]   like he would get so pissed,
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:54.440]   he would fight his own fist, right?
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.240]   That was a pretty emotional response
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:59.880]   where intensity and emotion
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.320]   were kind of interchangeable words, right, at some level.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.760]   I'm going to be direct.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.880]   There have been a lot of guys
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.200]   coming out of the SEAL teams I've been surprised to hear
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.940]   that kill themselves.
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:15.200]   And yesterday there was a major suicide.
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.200]   I didn't know this guy.
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:18.160]   And presumably we actually followed each other on social media,
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:20.920]   but I admittedly was not close to him, didn't know him,
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:21.760]   didn't know him at all.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.480]   In fact, his name was Twitch or something.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.880]   And maybe this guy was a public facing figure.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.940]   But listen, happens all too often.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:31.680]   And it even happens in former operators.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.300]   And suicide's something that fascinates me and intrigues me
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:38.360]   and scares the hell out of me.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:39.680]   Because for the life of me,
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:44.280]   I cannot map it to any specific thing in the brain or body
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.080]   that we're aware of.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.000]   And yet I've had several friends commit suicide,
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.660]   had my undergrad advisor committed suicide.
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:54.920]   The point is not them or their story.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:59.740]   The point is what in the world dictates
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:02.520]   whether or not somebody who has a community,
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.840]   who's doing well and then less well,
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.740]   decides to off themselves to end their own life
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:16.260]   versus decide I'm going to keep going.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.680]   I mean, this is, I'm raising this as a question.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.600]   I wish I had an answer.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.700]   I used to have ideas like, oh, it's time perception.
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:22.860]   You know, where these people are feeling so miserable
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.440]   that they feel it's going to go on forever.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.520]   But then you start reading the literature on suicide.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.040]   And I've started to go into this.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.220]   For those of you that can stomach it,
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:30.880]   and I don't know that I want to recommend this movie,
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.460]   but I'm just going to say it exists.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:33.300]   The movie, "The Bridge,"
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.280]   where they fixed the camera on the Golden Gate Bridge
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:38.200]   for a year, it turns out one person a day on average
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:39.400]   tries to jump off.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:41.240]   We talked to a guy who survived it.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.160]   By the way, he jumped off.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.260]   The moment he went off there, he thought,
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:45.880]   I wish I hadn't done that.
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:46.720]   He survived.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.400]   This kid with bipolar disorder, especially males,
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.060]   20 to 30 times higher incidents of suicide.
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:56.820]   Massive increase.
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.280]   The point is that there's something that happens
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:04.340]   in the brain where somehow people also will get the idea,
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:06.800]   and you hear this, that this is like something
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:08.740]   they're excited to do.
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:11.140]   Or that they're going to right the world somehow
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:11.980]   by doing this.
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:15.080]   Or that somehow it's like a gift to themselves.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.700]   Again, I'm not encouraging anybody to do this.
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:17.540]   I want to be very clear.
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.060]   But these are the things that you hear.
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:22.540]   And sadly, your community has lost a number of people
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:25.380]   through suicide.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.000]   And yet there are a lot of guys that thrive.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.180]   And so more as a template for trying to understand
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:33.500]   mental health and depression and suicide,
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   what are your thoughts on why some people seem to thrive
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:43.940]   and some people just go all the way down?
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:47.260]   - Clearly, that's a very complex question.
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:50.660]   And there's probably a lot of different answers.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:54.740]   And I certainly am not one to be able to answer
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:57.220]   that question, however.
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:59:04.580]   Probably where my thought has gone on this lately,
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:07.540]   because I've known some guys that have killed themselves
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:10.360]   and I've been totally shocked.
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:14.860]   But I've just been completely and totally shocked
[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:17.820]   that guys that I knew killed themselves.
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:21.420]   Guys that you would think, oh, this guy would never do this
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:22.900]   in a million years.
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:25.640]   And that's the feeling I've had a lot about a lot of the guys
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.880]   that I know that have killed themselves.
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:32.940]   I had a woman on my podcast named Sarah Wilkinson,
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:35.380]   and she's an awesome woman.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:37.740]   And she was married to a seal.
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:38.700]   His name was Chad.
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:39.580]   I didn't know him.
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:43.420]   He killed himself.
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:50.360]   And to hear her describe the story,
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:54.180]   the shocking thing about the story is
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:59.300]   that the guy that she knew and the guy that she married
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:06.080]   was not the same guy that killed himself.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.300]   Something happened to him
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:14.620]   that made him a different person.
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:20.700]   And look, they're getting all this information now
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:25.700]   about CTE and the brain trauma that you go through,
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:29.500]   and people are exposed to that.
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:34.460]   And I think if you've ever seen George Foreman,
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:36.640]   he seems totally normal and good to go, right?
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.380]   And Muhammad Ali, not so much.
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:40.540]   And I've known fighters,
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:43.000]   and you can look at any number of boxers
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.160]   that have had a career, and some of them are fine,
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.520]   and some of them have some real significant,
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.880]   what is it, pugilistic,
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:53.740]   there's a pugilistic syndrome, right?
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:56.180]   They've been punched too much and they have problems.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:57.700]   So different people,
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:02.700]   you can expose different people to blast impact,
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:04.740]   and it's gonna have a different impact over time.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:09.740]   And I think that, again, to hear Sarah explain that story
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:14.200]   and what she saw from her husband
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.120]   and how different he was when they got married
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.160]   compared to where they ended up, it's totally different.
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.520]   A totally different person.
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:28.200]   I had another friend of mine on who named Marcus Capone,
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:32.320]   and his wife came on with him, and she said the same thing.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.320]   Like the guy that she married was not the same guy
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.320]   that was ready to kill himself, and he didn't, thankfully.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.120]   It was a different person.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:48.120]   And it's not, look, if Fred is married to some woman
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:52.440]   and Fred and Jessica grow apart over time
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.440]   and he ends up with some other girl,
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.600]   it's still the same guy, right?
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.920]   It's still the same guy that is now,
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.800]   look, they grew apart, they're getting divorced, we get it.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:06.300]   But the way that both of them described their husbands
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:11.300]   as being different people, that's what stuck with me.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:12.820]   More than anything else.
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:18.700]   So I, you know, again, I'm throwing this out there
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:21.220]   only because it's what I've observed
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.620]   through the people that I know,
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:27.300]   and seeing and hearing those stories
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:31.300]   of people being totally different.
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:33.420]   And I've known a few people.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.740]   One of my friends, Dave, killed himself.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:36.740]   I never would have guessed in a million years
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:38.700]   that Dave would have killed himself.
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:41.020]   It just, it doesn't compute.
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:42.780]   It doesn't compute.
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:47.780]   And so my suspicion is there has to be something going on
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:51.940]   mechanically or chemically with the brain
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:56.360]   that causes them to get into a mode
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:59.860]   where they're depressed and they don't see a way out,
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:01.480]   and that that's the way they feel now.
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:03.540]   And again, what's interesting about this
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:06.740]   is we already talked about the fact that the selection,
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:08.860]   the selection process weeds out guys
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:12.300]   that are gonna take a loss and not be able to get up again.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:13.380]   No, you've got SEALs.
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:15.500]   SEALs can take a loss and get back up again.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:17.020]   That's what you learn how to do in bed.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.420]   Or that's what you, you don't learn how to do it.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:19.900]   You have it.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:21.060]   And if you make it through that training,
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.420]   you have that ability to take a loss.
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.880]   All right, cool, shake it off, get back up, keep going.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:27.980]   They're gonna do that to you.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.380]   So now you've got guys that are taking a loss
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:31.920]   and they don't see a way out anymore.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.140]   In fact, to such a point
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:35.140]   that they're gonna take their own lives.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:39.780]   It's, my suspicion is at some point
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:42.340]   they're gonna figure out that this exposure
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:47.340]   to the adrenaline, the explosions all the time.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:51.420]   I mean, you go out to a range, just in peace time.
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:53.980]   You go out to a range and you shoot a Carl Gustoff
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:56.260]   and you're a range safety officer.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:57.480]   So you go out there with every guy
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:58.420]   that's shooting a Carl Gustoff.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:01.340]   It's a big giant like bazooka looking weapon.
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:02.340]   And every time you shoot it,
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:04.180]   it kind of rattles your cage a little bit.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.120]   Well, if you're a range safety officer
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.340]   and you're out there and you're gonna watch everyone
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.420]   in the platoon shoot three of those,
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:12.820]   it's gonna have an impact.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:15.700]   Then you go overseas and you're a breacher
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:17.420]   or you're part of a breach team.
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.120]   I mean, at a time where one of my guys,
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.560]   we're doing an assault on a compound.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:24.580]   I'm on the ladder.
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:26.900]   Like most buildings in Iraq have a wall around them.
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.700]   So the way we would conduct these raids,
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:30.460]   put the ladder up, the assault,
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:32.580]   the breach team would climb over the ladder
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:34.560]   and I would go right behind the breach team
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:35.780]   and I would stand on the ladder.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.500]   So I'm looking at the building, observing,
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.800]   making sure there's no one waking up,
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.600]   make sure there's no threats.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.140]   And then as I'm watching this guy in particular,
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:46.380]   he puts the breach on the door, explosive breach.
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.660]   So he's gonna blow the door up.
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:49.500]   He's got his little team with him.
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.360]   He puts the breach on the door.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.640]   He starts to back away and there's like an obstacle there.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:56.180]   It was like a freaking table or a lawn chair or something.
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:58.220]   And he couldn't get around it.
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:04:59.140]   And I'm sitting there, it's dark.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:00.100]   I mean, it's the middle of the night,
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:01.020]   it's two o'clock in the morning.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.660]   And I'm like, I wonder what he's gonna do.
[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:05.060]   I see him kind of stuck for a second.
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:06.740]   And I just see him lay down and I'm like,
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:08.340]   oh, he's just gonna take this thing.
[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:11.020]   And sure enough, three or four feet away
[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:13.860]   from this breach point, he lays down
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:17.020]   and just clacks off this explosive charge.
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:19.340]   And I jump over the wall and as I'm going in,
[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:21.380]   I'm trying to get the rest of the platoon
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.300]   to go and commence this assault.
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:26.300]   I look at him, he looked like he just got
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:28.680]   hit in the head with a baseball bat.
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.260]   And guess what he did the next night?
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:31.740]   Another breach on another target.
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.680]   And guess what he did the next night?
[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:34.820]   Another breach on another target.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:39.160]   So you get guys that have that exposure,
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.580]   which is, I mean, every SEAL is eating a breach.
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:43.800]   I mean, you're eating flashbangs,
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.380]   you're eating breaches, you're shooting 50 cows.
[02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:50.120]   Like you're eating some traumatic brain injury.
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:52.540]   But then you must have some people
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:56.520]   that have some sort of genetic propensity
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.860]   to have this negative thing happen.
[02:05:58.860 --> 02:06:01.420]   And I can only guess, man,
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:03.460]   that this has something to do with it.
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.180]   Because otherwise, we wouldn't be hearing
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:08.620]   so many of these stories.
[02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:10.660]   And of course, we're just talking about the SEAL teams.
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:13.300]   We're not talking about the military writ large,
[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.580]   which is in the same exact boat.
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:21.540]   I'm also nervous about the social contagion of suicide
[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:24.580]   within the veteran community.
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:26.600]   I'm nervous about that.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.500]   It's one of the things that makes me apprehensive
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.340]   about talking about it.
[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:30.860]   But obviously I've talked about,
[02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:33.620]   I've had people on my podcast to discuss these things.
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:39.040]   But I am worried about that social contagion of,
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.980]   man, Fred did it.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:43.020]   He got all this attention
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:45.620]   and he doesn't have to deal with anything anymore.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:46.980]   I'm going to do it too.
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:50.620]   There's got to be some level of that going on as well.
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:53.720]   So it's a horrible situation.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.940]   - Yeah, the social contagion part
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:57.700]   is one that hits home from a different dimension.
[02:06:57.700 --> 02:06:58.720]   The high school I went to,
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:00.700]   which is, name isn't important,
[02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:02.660]   like Gunn High School, G-U-N-N.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.260]   Gunn High School is famous
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:06.900]   for being one of the better public high schools,
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:08.900]   not that I attended as much as I should have.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:10.620]   I could tell you more about the curbs in the parking lot
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:12.620]   than I could tell you about the classes I took.
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:14.340]   And that's just not encouraging people
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:15.200]   to not attend high school.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:16.040]   Please do.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:18.680]   It took a lot of really hard work to climb back up
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:20.220]   to where I should have been when I graduated.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:24.020]   But it has an infamous reputation,
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:25.820]   or I should say a reputation as an infamous school
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:27.340]   because it's one of the highest suicide rates
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:28.860]   in any of the schools in the country
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:30.580]   because there's train tracks that run through town
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:32.540]   and there was a kind of a contagion of kids
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:34.040]   throwing themselves on the train tracks.
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:36.260]   This was happening a lot.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:38.500]   This was written up in various newspapers, et cetera.
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:40.220]   Fortunately, it seems to have died down.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:43.000]   Again, I'm also hesitant to like talk about this
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.300]   because no one wants to spark this,
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:48.100]   but there does seem to be something about lack of ability
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:50.160]   to see into a future, obviously,
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:53.060]   or the future that people are seeing into is so dark
[02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:54.840]   that somehow they lose touch with the idea
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.140]   that emotions come and go.
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:58.500]   You said it about emotion, about motivation.
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:07:59.560]   Emotions come and go.
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:01.620]   But somehow people lose touch with that.
[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:04.280]   And then I will venture a guess,
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:06.120]   and here I'm hoping someone's going to figure this out
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:08.920]   at some point so we can have a more concrete conversation
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.840]   about the mechanisms and what to do about it.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:13.540]   But I think there's also something about identity,
[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:17.460]   about loss of a place to put one's energy,
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:20.160]   something useful in the world.
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:21.820]   If you're a, what you're talking about here
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:24.280]   are guys that are generators, right?
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:25.820]   They are not projectors.
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:26.660]   They're generators.
[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:31.500]   They live to have effective action on the world for good
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:33.840]   and then end up killing themselves.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:36.100]   In youth, it's a little more complicated
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:39.740]   to put a finger on 'cause what's going on there.
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:41.140]   We assume depression.
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.380]   But then in learning more about suicide,
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:45.560]   there's also this kind of like excitement
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.440]   for certain people about solving something
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:49.200]   that seemed unsolvable any other way.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.320]   And again, I'm certainly not encouraging this.
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:53.240]   I'm strongly discouraging people
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:55.620]   from taking their own life, obviously.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:58.320]   But there's something about time
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:59.740]   and the loss of perception about time.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:01.280]   And one thing that we know for sure,
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.220]   here we can really hang our hat on something,
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:06.500]   is that if you do the forensics on somebody
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:10.840]   that was suicidal, attempted, or took their life,
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:14.260]   in the preceding days and weeks,
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:17.960]   their sleep-wake schedule was completely whacked.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.560]   They exit the normal routine of most people.
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.520]   They isolate through inversions of time.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:27.120]   And I do wonder sometimes whether or not
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:28.960]   the vampire shifts, as they're sometimes called,
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.960]   the nighttime deployments and the back and forth.
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.520]   I mean, that's a lot for a system to take.
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:34.860]   Shift workers kill themselves
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.160]   far more than non-shift workers.
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:39.000]   So I do think there's something there.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.160]   And again, I'm not saying everyone needs
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:41.920]   to be in bed by nine and up by four,
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.280]   and although that would be a great schedule for most people.
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:47.940]   But I do think that there are some universal laws
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:51.700]   of what makes the human body and brain healthy.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:54.540]   And if you violate those laws long enough,
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:57.600]   with CTE or with disruption in your schedules,
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:58.640]   you run the risk,
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:00.560]   especially if there's a predisposition there,
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:02.760]   and then other factors start to layer in.
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.660]   Again, and I have to apologize
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.140]   'cause I don't have any real answers
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:09.500]   or more biology or psychology to firmly throw at this,
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.920]   except the warning for people who are bipolar
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:12.960]   and know somebody with bipolar.
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.760]   They are 20 to 30 times more likely to kill themselves.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:18.080]   And males in particular are more likely to use methods
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:20.720]   that will kill them the first time as opposed to survive.
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:23.080]   There's a big sex difference there.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.920]   - Yeah, you throw alcohol in there too, you know?
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.460]   And Marcus has run an organization now
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:34.360]   where they're taking vets down to do the psychedelic,
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.060]   what they call it, a journey.
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:38.420]   - This is Veterans Solutions.
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:41.200]   Yeah, they're a great organization.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:43.420]   And I should mention, very bipartisan organization.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:45.480]   I attended one event on Coronado
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:47.220]   and there were people from the far left,
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:49.320]   the far right, politicians and everything in between
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:50.800]   talking about how critical this is.
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:52.000]   So this is not a political issue.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.880]   This is a mental health issue.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:58.000]   - Yeah, and even when I reflected on Marcus talking to me,
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.020]   he was talking about how he's kind of
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:01.640]   in this downward spiral.
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:03.640]   Part of the downward spiral, he's drinking every day.
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:07.640]   And I'm thinking to myself, man.
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.120]   I didn't think of it during the show.
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.320]   I kind of was thinking about it afterwards.
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.740]   I was thinking, man, if you're drinking all the time,
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:17.640]   you're on a downward spiral.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.540]   That's one thing you should just stop.
[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.840]   Let's stop that immediately.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:25.880]   So I just wanted to throw that out there.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:30.440]   I think when that's another sign from the outside looking in,
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.240]   if someone's self-medicating with alcohol,
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:35.500]   it's not a good place, not a good place.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:36.340]   They're not in a good place
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:38.740]   and they could probably use some help.
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:39.760]   - I appreciate you saying it.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:41.240]   Again, we did this episode on alcohol.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.680]   I went into it totally open-minded.
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:43.680]   I've never been a big drinker.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.440]   I've had it, I can drink or not drink.
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:49.040]   Was never really into drugs at all.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:50.720]   You know, dabbled a little bit when I was younger.
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.020]   I regret it, frankly.
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:53.220]   Brain is plastic early on.
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:54.060]   I didn't need that.
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:56.400]   Never did hard drugs, never touched cocaine, amphetamine
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.240]   or anything like that.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:59.900]   So, and if I had, I would say, right?
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:01.880]   I think I'm comfortable enough in my position in life
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.420]   that if I had, I'd certainly say.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:07.420]   But I think that it's pretty clear
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:08.600]   that alcohol is bad for us.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.640]   It's certainly past a certain, you know, to drink.
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:13.620]   We limit people, especially with the propensity
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:16.200]   for alcoholism or who are dealing with other issues.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.480]   That's especially the case for not drinking, right?
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:22.420]   And I guess, you know, we got into some hard territory here,
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:27.420]   but I think if this conversation cues up an awareness
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:30.080]   to anybody, which I hope it would,
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.480]   either people that are in that space of wondering
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:33.640]   if they should continue or not,
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:35.400]   or that know somebody who might be,
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.320]   I do think that the takeaway is very clear,
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:42.600]   which is that, you know, there are ways
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.700]   to avoid these traps and to avoid making these traps worse.
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:49.000]   And I think regular sleep-wake schedules,
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.280]   understanding that, and I wrote this down,
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:55.080]   that, you know, you in particular have said several times
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:57.960]   that rather than looking for sources of things outside you,
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:00.660]   like a job or a relationship, which are all great,
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:03.180]   but as sources of energy or motivation or inspiration
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:06.520]   to use action as a positive action as a source of energy,
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:09.520]   I think is just a, if I could like put that up
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.280]   on a billboard in Times Square, I would, right?
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.200]   And I put your name next to it,
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.380]   which is that action is a, positive action
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:19.160]   is a source of energy that then you can recycle
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:20.000]   into more things.
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.620]   I think going back to the fundamentals, right?
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.060]   - Yeah, and positive action is
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:26.660]   when you have to contend with something,
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:28.500]   when there's something that you're afraid of, right?
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.780]   Step into it, move towards it,
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:32.420]   that's how you're gonna solve that problem.
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:35.380]   You don't solve problems by running away from them.
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:38.060]   You solve them by moving towards them
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:39.820]   and figuring out what's going on.
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:42.120]   And I mean, alcohol is obviously a clear way
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.820]   to avoid the problem, at least for the next four hours.
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:47.700]   And you wake up and that problem's still there
[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.500]   and that's not good.
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:51.420]   But you know, when you've got some kind of a problem,
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.140]   and listen, then we could go down the whole path
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:56.540]   of talking about the indirect approach,
[02:13:56.540 --> 02:14:01.540]   which is a theory of combat, which I completely believe in,
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:03.900]   but it also applies to, you know,
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.080]   interacting with other people.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:07.300]   If you have a problem with some other person,
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:09.260]   to think to myself, well, I got a problem with Andrew,
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:11.120]   I'm gonna go confront him on it.
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:13.060]   And that might not be the best solution.
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:14.900]   In fact, it's probably not the best solution
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:16.660]   for me to go confront you with the problem,
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:18.460]   'cause now we're gonna have a confrontation.
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:21.380]   It might be better for me to take an indirect approach
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:24.100]   and not confront you, but instead engage in a conversation
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:26.740]   with you about something that's maybe adjacent
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:27.980]   to the problem that I have.
[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:30.260]   And then eventually that builds our relationship
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.340]   to a point where you start to recognize,
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:35.200]   oh, I bet Jocko feels something about this thing.
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:38.100]   And we can move towards a solution instead of me
[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:41.260]   trying to punch you in the face with some truth
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:43.540]   that I believe versus the truth that you believe.
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:46.460]   And now we're engaged in combat and that's bad.
[02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:47.620]   There's gonna be casualties.
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:49.620]   I'd rather take an indirect approach
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:51.780]   and build a relationship where we can solve problems
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:52.940]   in a more positive way.
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:55.100]   - I love that.
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:57.780]   And I love it because it really speaks to the power
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.680]   of thinking carefully and being patient
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:03.340]   and a little bit slower at times.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:04.760]   I also heard you say something earlier
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.900]   that's still flagging in my mind, which is,
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:10.440]   you know, not thinking too much.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:13.800]   I think it seems to be a time where thinking too much
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.360]   is very dangerous.
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:18.120]   And again, we can keep the discussion that we were having
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.680]   about mental health or we could even just call it
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:21.640]   what is mental illness.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:24.500]   I think everyone would agree suicide is some reflection
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:25.760]   of an unhealthy state.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.320]   We can keep that in the backdrop as we talk about this,
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:32.560]   but this isn't necessarily only about that.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.640]   You seem to have an ability to engage in things
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:37.720]   without thinking too much.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:42.060]   And yet also to sit back and be pretty observant.
[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:45.160]   And you've talked about third person-ing of the self.
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:46.640]   I'd love to talk a little bit more about this,
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.120]   even though it's a topic you've delved into before.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.200]   And in particular, the topic of meditation.
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.000]   I've been reading more about meditation.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.400]   I've meditated for different stretches in my life,
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.120]   different amounts of time.
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.540]   And there are two basic forms of meditation
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:03.800]   that I only recently learned about.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:06.480]   One is a focused attention meditation.
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:08.960]   You're sitting, closing your eyes, focusing on your breath,
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:11.600]   body, body surface, or even a visual target
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:13.380]   in your environment and just focus.
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:17.040]   And we know that that enhances one's ability to focus.
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:17.980]   If you do it too late in the day,
[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:21.560]   it also enhance your ability to not fall asleep.
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.960]   A lot of people don't realize the meditation
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.820]   too late in the day, if it's a focused meditation,
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:26.320]   you're just ramping up the activity
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:27.560]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:31.560]   It's a great tool for getting better at focusing.
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:34.140]   But then there's also this type of meditation
[02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:36.120]   called open observer meditation,
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.080]   where you purposefully don't include a target
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.880]   in your mind or in your vision or in your hearing.
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.560]   And you just sit there, eyes closed or eyes open,
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:48.000]   and you go into a place of whatever comes up,
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.720]   but you don't hover there too long.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.900]   The goal is to not hover on any one thing,
[02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:57.320]   which sounds like deliberate attention deficit disorder,
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:00.520]   but it's actually a pretty cool method, it turns out,
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:03.920]   for restoring our ability to engage in focus,
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:06.200]   but also for one particular thing
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:07.040]   that you mentioned earlier,
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:10.360]   which is creativity and creative problem solving,
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:12.400]   which of course requires accessing,
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.360]   let's just say more colors on the palette
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:16.160]   than your vision might be on realizing,
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:18.040]   oh, there's also all these other colors
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:19.520]   over here in the periphery that I'm missing
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:20.720]   'cause I'm hyper focused.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:22.960]   Do you meditate?
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.240]   If you do meditate, is it more of an open monitoring
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:27.720]   or a focused meditation?
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:30.200]   And if you don't do a kind of standard meditation,
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.520]   are there times throughout your day
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:33.480]   and your routine and your week where,
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:34.920]   as I'm describing this,
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.600]   it maps to something that kind of feels like
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:40.320]   open monitoring or focused meditation?
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.520]   - Yeah, so no, I don't meditate.
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.880]   I haven't ever, I don't think I've ever actually meditated
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:48.640]   for one second in my life, and I...
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:49.560]   - And I refuse to.
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:50.840]   - No, no, it's not that at all.
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:52.840]   I know Sam Harris sent me his app
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:55.020]   and we were gonna do a podcast and I said,
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:57.280]   I'll do it for two weeks and we'll do a podcast
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:59.200]   and I'll be more enlightened and everything,
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:01.040]   and I didn't even give Sam Harris two weeks, you know?
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:03.600]   So I still owe Sam Harris two weeks
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:07.180]   on his app of meditation so we can see how it impacts me.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:08.900]   But no, I've never done it before.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:10.640]   I've never tried to do it.
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:15.640]   And that being said, if the goal is to take a step back
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:17.920]   and detach from what's going on,
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:20.080]   I do that all day, every day.
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.760]   So that is something that I've talked about.
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:25.680]   It's something that I tried to teach.
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:28.680]   I tried to teach the young SEAL leaders
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:30.520]   not to get caught up in what's happening
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:32.640]   right in front of them, but to take a step back,
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:35.640]   detach from the situation, detach from their emotions,
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.160]   see more of what's happening.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:41.180]   You're talking about seeing more colors of the palette.
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:43.900]   Well, on the battlefield, I want people to be able to see
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:48.040]   more angles, more maneuvers, more opportunities,
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:50.400]   more of what the enemy might do, more perspective.
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:53.400]   That's what I always tried to achieve.
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.480]   And so I'm sorry, I apologize.
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:58.960]   I can't give you any good discussion on meditation
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.960]   'cause I haven't tried it.
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:03.040]   - No apology necessary.
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:05.160]   But I will ask, when you go surfing
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:07.560]   and you're sitting in the water waiting for a wave,
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:10.440]   are you focused on one particular location on the horizon
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:13.200]   or are you kind of in kind of a open monitoring,
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.640]   just enjoying, just bouncing up and down in the water?
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:19.200]   Like where is your attention during activities like that?
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.760]   - Yeah, so surfing, oftentimes surfing, you're a monkey mind
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:25.060]   and you're just not thinking about anything.
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:26.060]   Same thing with jiu-jitsu.
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:28.880]   Also with surfing, you know, if you're waiting for a wave,
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.960]   your mind is just going.
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:33.560]   I mean, it's in another universe sometimes
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:34.840]   as you're sitting there waiting
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:36.760]   'cause you're just looking out at the horizon.
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.640]   And your mind, I mean, my mind,
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:40.720]   I'm thinking about all kinds of,
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:44.000]   I have to come home sometimes and like write notes
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.760]   because I thought of this, I thought of an idea,
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:46.880]   I thought of a perspective.
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:47.960]   That happens to me at jiu-jitsu,
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:50.240]   that happens to me talking to people
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.600]   where someone's talking about something,
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:52.800]   I'm like, oh, I gotta get an idea right now.
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:53.800]   I'm gonna go write that down.
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.000]   Have to go and write it down.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.360]   I have notes in my phone, you know,
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:00.460]   like pages and pages and pages of notes in my phone
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:03.660]   of ideas that I had and I write them down.
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:04.960]   - Do you voice memo things?
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.020]   - No, I type them.
[02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:06.860]   - Yeah.
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:09.640]   - I only need to type like seven words on,
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.980]   and then I have the whole ideas in my head.
[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:12.820]   So.
[02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:14.960]   - Yeah, I put a lot into the notes in my phone as well.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:17.080]   And it probably looks like gibberish to a lot of people,
[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:20.240]   but I go back through them when I'm on the plane,
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:22.480]   especially problems I was challenged with
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:23.600]   10 years ago or something.
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:24.440]   And I look like, oh my God,
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:27.000]   I'm just dealing with the same thing, different situation,
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.540]   same me, right?
[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:35.000]   There's that, we had a amazing psychiatrist on the show,
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.480]   but I'd love to hear a conversation between the two of you.
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:39.760]   His name is Paul Conte.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:41.320]   He was trained at Stanford and Harvard.
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:42.600]   He's an amazing guy.
[02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:46.620]   Actually talks openly about the tragedy
[02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:47.760]   that his brother killed himself,
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:50.000]   which was what drove him into psychiatry.
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.340]   And he's an interesting guy because he's obviously
[02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:54.320]   highly educated, incredibly smart.
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:55.880]   He wrote a book on trauma,
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.000]   but he has incredible knowledge
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.960]   about a number of other areas of psychology,
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:01.280]   including narcissism, sociopathy.
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:03.480]   He's worked in a lot of really interesting domains
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:05.640]   with interesting people that everyone listening
[02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:07.720]   on his podcasts would recognize.
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:09.560]   Of course, he's not going to reveal who those people are,
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:14.560]   but, and, you know, he talks about the fact that,
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:19.440]   you know, you can look at different people, right?
[02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:20.760]   He was actually the one that shared with me
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:23.900]   this notion of generators and projectors
[02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:25.600]   and directed me towards that literature.
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:28.240]   But when he came on the podcast, he, you know,
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:31.080]   he talked a little bit about that stuff,
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:33.360]   but he talked mostly about trauma.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.040]   But then, you know, we were talking about
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:38.280]   ways in which people engage in the world
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.880]   and different archetypes and how you start looking
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:43.420]   at stories throughout history and you start seeing
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:45.780]   the same themes over and over, right?
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:48.840]   Westerns, you know, this idea of a guy rides into town
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:53.880]   and does some repair work, like defeats the sinister person
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:55.160]   or things that are imposing all the time,
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:56.440]   then rides to the next town.
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:58.600]   It's always like, it ends with, it's going to keep continuing
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:00.160]   and then, but then when we got into this discussion
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.820]   of relationship, he talks about, you know,
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:04.160]   he said this on the podcast of a patient who, you know,
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:08.840]   said, you know, I've been in 10 abusive relationships.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.440]   And he'd say to that patient,
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:13.380]   no, you've been in one relationship 10 times, right?
[02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:17.080]   Which is essentially, it's all about your issue, right?
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:19.580]   That's not you, I'm not, I purposely didn't point at you
[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:20.640]   for those listening.
[02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:24.260]   And I think that those features of ourselves
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:27.400]   that we bring from condition to condition can be negative
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.620]   or they can be positive.
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:31.100]   One thing that's interesting, and here I'm not trying
[02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:34.160]   to solve or understand the SEAL team community per se,
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.240]   but I think they represent an important archetype
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.200]   because they are selected for this ability
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:42.500]   to take hard conditions and failures
[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:43.640]   and turn them into wins.
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:47.080]   That's one of the selection criteria seems to be.
[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:49.420]   They're finding who has that capability.
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:53.000]   I see a lot of, and happen to know a few people
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.740]   from the SEAL teams who get out and do really well.
[02:22:57.740 --> 02:22:58.640]   You know, the great businesses,
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:01.280]   you're a shining example of this and you have a family
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:02.840]   and you know, you've got German Shepherd too.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.280]   Yeah, we'll talk about animals in a little bit.
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.360]   You got a dog and it's like you surf and you train.
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:09.020]   And like, I'm sure you have your dark places,
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:11.120]   dark moments and challenges like anybody else,
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:13.680]   but things look to me like they're going pretty well.
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.020]   And then I also know people from the SEAL teams.
[02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:19.040]   Okay, they don't go down the path of suicide, fortunately,
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:21.800]   but it's sort of like, they don't do as well
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:23.720]   as I would have thought.
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.620]   And I'm certainly not picking on this community.
[02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:28.000]   I also see this from people who were professional athletes.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000]   I know kids that were phenomenal in high school.
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.320]   I mean, these were like early admission
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:33.620]   to all the Ivy League schools,
[02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:36.360]   'cause that was what happened in the town that I grew up in.
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:40.640]   And I look at them now and I'm like, wow, like gosh,
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.760]   somehow it's not working out.
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:44.440]   And I think it's important for people to hear that,
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:46.720]   that you know, yes, winning creates the propensity
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:50.100]   for more winning, but then why do you think it is
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:53.900]   that in a community where people are trained
[02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:57.160]   to solve problems, adapt and make things work,
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:24:00.280]   some people flourish outside the military
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:03.800]   and some flourish less and some we already talked about
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:06.600]   really, you know, go down the dark traps.
[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:08.340]   What do you think is the quality
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:11.080]   that allows people to be really adaptable,
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:14.120]   in particular, 'cause most of us live in a landscape
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:17.220]   where we have to deal with people who are not us,
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:20.680]   like people that are not good at what we're good at.
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:22.500]   And sometimes that's an asset, sometimes it's not.
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:23.980]   You seem to be particularly good
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:26.520]   at like understanding the human animal
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.360]   and working with that.
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:30.440]   So again, this is a broad question.
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.680]   We're going very broadband here
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:33.380]   and we'll get narrower again in a little bit,
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:35.900]   but I'd love your thoughts on like, why is it,
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:39.620]   how is it, what determines whether or not somebody thrives
[02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:40.840]   in novel environments?
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:43.820]   - I have to start off by just by saying
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:45.640]   I wrote a note as you were talking,
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:48.800]   I just put seal and then I put the not equals sign,
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:50.800]   you know, like, 'cause you can't say
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:52.880]   that a seal equals anything.
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:53.720]   - Excellent point.
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:56.200]   - It's, I mean, there's guys,
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:57.920]   there's guys that have been in the SEAL teams
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:01.640]   that are murderers, like there's-
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:02.480]   - Like real life murderers.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:05.280]   - Like murderers, like rapists and murderers
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:07.360]   that went through SEAL training, rapists, murderers,
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:08.880]   and they're in prison for the rest of their lives.
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.140]   Like that's a thing.
[02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:12.220]   There's people that have been in the SEAL teams
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:15.480]   that, you know, got kicked out of the SEAL teams for drugs
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:18.880]   and I mean, you name it and we've got that
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:20.280]   and we've got guys that are just lazy
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:22.680]   and we've got guys that it just-
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:24.800]   - And physicians, you could say this about physicians,
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:28.160]   there've been sociopathic, you know,
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:30.520]   serial killer physicians and then there are ones
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:32.600]   that are in third world countries right now
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:36.000]   that would not accept a billion dollars
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.760]   to stop serving people at the level of the basic medicine
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:40.740]   that they deserve.
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:43.040]   - So there's the, yeah, there's the SEALs that get out
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:46.240]   and just volunteer to go help in the worst places
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:49.480]   in the world, so you've got a full spectrum of people.
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.880]   So to say a SEAL equals success in any domain,
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:56.620]   the only domain you can say that they're successful
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.200]   is they made it through basic SEAL training
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:59.560]   'cause guys make it through basic SEAL training
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.160]   and they're not good SEALs, right?
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:02.500]   That happens, you know?
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:05.920]   So you get guys that make it through basic SEAL training
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:08.000]   and they make it through SEAL qualification training
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.400]   and they make it to a SEAL team
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.880]   and they get kicked out of the SEAL teams
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:12.520]   'cause they're not good SEALs.
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:15.000]   They weren't meant to do that job.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000]   That happens.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.200]   So all they've proven by making it
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:20.200]   through basic SEAL training is they can kind of suck it up
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:22.540]   for a while and there's also guys that make it
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:24.480]   through basic SEAL training 'cause they learned
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:26.360]   how to maneuver through the system.
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:28.740]   They learned what to do and what the minimum requirements
[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:29.880]   were and how they could skate through this.
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:31.400]   There's guys like that.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.320]   It's not a huge number but they're absolutely there.
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.820]   - We see them in science.
[02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.980]   You know, people that go to a lab, figure out
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:41.480]   who the director of the lab is at the level of psychology
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:43.580]   and this is actually one of the more dangerous aspects
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:44.420]   of science.
[02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:46.480]   It actually negatively impacts all of society.
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:47.760]   I'll just say it.
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:49.560]   And any scientists will know what I'm talking about.
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:51.320]   They find the big famous labs.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:53.460]   They figure out who that leader of the lab is
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:55.900]   and they get that person the data they want.
[02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:58.160]   They might not make the data up
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:02.080]   but they will certainly discard the data that don't fit,
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:05.360]   right, which is one way of making data up by exclusion,
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:06.200]   right?
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:08.080]   It's not literally like painting pictures of cells
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.600]   that aren't there or something but that happens a lot
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:12.200]   and those people often go far.
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:15.440]   They rarely go all the way because pretty soon
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:18.740]   their reputation expands to the point where people go like,
[02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:20.560]   yeah, no one can repeat that result like that.
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:22.800]   But these people sit in very high positions,
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.240]   not at Stanford, right?
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:26.840]   I will say, I don't know any of my colleagues at Stanford
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:31.700]   that meet those criteria but you see them
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:33.440]   and you see what they're doing
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:36.400]   and they're basically solving a social engineering thing.
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.460]   They just happen to be doing it in science.
[02:27:38.460 --> 02:27:40.540]   Now, why anyone would do that in science, I don't know
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:41.740]   because you don't get rich in science,
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:43.980]   you certainly don't get famous but for whatever reason
[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:45.880]   they figured it out that that's where they're going to do it
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.060]   and I'm sure you see it in law firms,
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:50.360]   I'm sure you see it in every single domain of life.
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.440]   - Now, you pointed out that there's some people
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:54.800]   that make it to the Ivy League schools
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:55.980]   and they graduate from an Ivy League school
[02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:57.400]   and then they don't do well.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:59.400]   And to me, that's very similar to someone
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:00.880]   that might make it to the SEAL teams,
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:02.640]   do well in the SEAL teams and then they get out
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.320]   and they don't do well.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.600]   It's probably 'cause what I talked about earlier
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:08.660]   when I went to Navy bootcamp,
[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:09.680]   here's what you got to do.
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.820]   If you do it well, you'll be rewarded.
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:13.640]   Well, if you're in high school and your dad,
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:16.900]   your mom and dad say, hey, if you do good in high school,
[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:18.640]   you're going to get into this Ivy League school
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:20.000]   and you get into that Ivy League school
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.680]   and here's what you need to do in high school.
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.640]   You need to get good grades.
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:24.260]   You need to be part of the glee club.
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:26.200]   You need to, whatever the things are that you got to do,
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:27.840]   you got to speak a different language.
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:31.320]   You got to go volunteer in Guatemala in the summertime.
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:32.160]   You got to do these things
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:33.560]   and then you'll get into the good college.
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:34.620]   Once you get in the good college,
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:35.580]   you got to get this degree.
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:36.560]   Once you get that degree.
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:40.360]   So they've had a path laid out for them of boxes to check
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:43.160]   and they go and check the boxes and when they get done,
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:45.320]   no one has put any more boxes out in front of them
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:46.760]   so they don't know what to do.
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:51.360]   And that can certainly happen from someone in the SEAL teams
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:53.720]   or someone in the military that what they've been,
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:54.800]   hey, this is your mission.
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:55.680]   This is what you got to do.
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:57.560]   Here's what you need to do to do it well.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:59.220]   Check the box, check the box, check the box,
[02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:00.720]   check the box and it's time to retire
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:03.560]   and there's no one putting a box in front of them to check.
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:07.280]   And so unless someone, some guys get out of the SEAL teams
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:09.160]   and they go into a big corporate structure
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:10.320]   and they kick ass because there's someone
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:11.860]   in the corporate world saying,
[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:13.960]   hey, here's what you got to do next year and they do great.
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:15.400]   And that's super good for them
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:16.960]   and they actually really like it.
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:18.000]   I was talking to a guy the other day,
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.440]   he's like a full on in a corporation,
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:22.040]   he's doing a great job, he likes what he's doing.
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:23.580]   It's awesome.
[02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:25.480]   So, but I think you get some guys
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:30.400]   that they don't really have the open minds
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:32.280]   to see where opportunities are
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:34.000]   and they, you know, one thing that's nice
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.260]   about the SEAL teams is there's a lot of,
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:40.280]   you get a lot of freedom of maneuver, right?
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:41.840]   You can really do a lot of stuff
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:43.760]   that you kind of want to do.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:45.360]   And so when they look at the corporate world,
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:46.800]   they don't see that and they think,
[02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.040]   I'm not going to do that,
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:52.320]   but then they're not quite sure how to take the next step.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:53.800]   So I think that's why you might see some guys
[02:29:53.800 --> 02:29:56.280]   that aren't super successful
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.860]   because they don't really know what to do
[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:02.660]   and they don't really have a mind
[02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:05.820]   that's open to look for opportunities.
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:09.840]   And also you got some guys that success for them
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.020]   is they're going to hang out with their family
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:13.360]   and they're going to, you know, get in good shape
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:14.720]   and they're going to run some triathlons
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:16.860]   or competing, whatever they're going to do,
[02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:17.700]   they're going to go do it
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.800]   and that's what they're looking to do, you know,
[02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:21.360]   which is also awesome.
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.740]   Go take time, go enjoy your family, man.
[02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:24.920]   You gave enough to your country,
[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:26.920]   go hang out with your kids.
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:29.560]   That's success as far as I'm concerned too.
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:30.480]   - I agree there.
[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:32.640]   I know far too many people who are successful
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:33.680]   in their professional lives,
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:35.720]   but who have very diminished personal lives
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:37.840]   and it is not a pretty picture.
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:42.240]   You know, you mentioned the parent kind of driving the kid,
[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:43.380]   do this, do that.
[02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:45.880]   In that scenario, I sense tones of fear.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.840]   It's all about not being a failure.
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:50.560]   It's not actually about love of your craft
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:52.100]   or what you enjoy.
[02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:53.640]   Pretty early in my science career,
[02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:54.760]   I learned that there are certain people
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:56.240]   who are just ambitious.
[02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:57.080]   They just like to win.
[02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.500]   And I used to joke around, it's not polite,
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:00.520]   but I used to go, you know what?
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:03.040]   We should all just tell that person
[02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:04.520]   that like the new cool thing
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:07.020]   is like trying to understand the biology of like,
[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:08.800]   and I would say like feces or something.
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:09.920]   And they'd probably work on it.
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.440]   And they'd be like, yeah, it's like the greatest thing.
[02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:13.040]   'Cause they actually don't care what they're working on.
[02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:14.660]   For them, it's just the hunt.
[02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:16.640]   And I learned that actually people like that
[02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:19.980]   can serve an important role because like,
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.400]   well, there's actually a whole microbiome.
[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:23.120]   There are actually labs that do work on feces.
[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:25.760]   So forgive me, my colleagues that work on microbiomes,
[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:28.880]   but in all seriousness, you know,
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:31.480]   people who are just ambitious can be very effective
[02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:32.880]   because you put a problem in front of them.
[02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:34.560]   It's like a dog that will just retrieve.
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:36.120]   It's like to just go,
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:40.060]   as opposed to love of retrieving for retrieving sake.
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:41.880]   It's like you give it that same dog,
[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:43.840]   the analogy here would be give that same dog a high jump
[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:45.280]   and they're like into high jumping, right?
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.680]   Or whatever it is or diving underwater.
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:51.100]   But I think of people more like animals
[02:31:51.100 --> 02:31:53.080]   and more like different dog species.
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:56.380]   Like we, as your case was with music,
[02:31:56.380 --> 02:31:59.000]   particular music and communities,
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.920]   or the example of shopping for the pants
[02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:02.720]   and that experience of like the first time
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.320]   you tap into something that really feels
[02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:05.500]   kind of unique to you.
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:07.300]   You're like, there's something here.
[02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:11.000]   To be able to find work that includes that,
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.100]   but also is hard and also allows you to evolve over time.
[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:17.460]   I mean, I think that's the real gift
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:19.800]   that I think most people are seeking.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.240]   And of course, there's no shortcut to that
[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:25.060]   except perhaps one, which is to be able to sense
[02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:26.940]   the difference between ambition
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:28.760]   and there's no better word for it,
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.440]   let's just call it what it is, which is love.
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:31.960]   Like I love this.
[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:34.200]   And the reason I think that love is so powerful
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:35.900]   and here I'm sounding like Lex Friedman,
[02:32:35.900 --> 02:32:38.320]   but I don't mean inter-relational love.
[02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:40.640]   I mean like sort of the being able to sense
[02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:44.920]   what that feels like is that I do believe
[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:49.280]   that it allows us to tap into an enormous number of things
[02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:52.860]   that fear alone and ambition alone
[02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:55.360]   and just being a hard driving person alone
[02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:57.360]   will not allow us to tap into.
[02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:00.680]   Things like adaptiveness, creativity.
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:03.020]   And I think there's a really obvious reason for it,
[02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:05.780]   which is that the one thing we know about our species
[02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:07.720]   is that we want to make more of ourselves
[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:09.320]   and to take good care of our young.
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:11.320]   Whether or not everyone has kids or not is irrelevant.
[02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:14.120]   The point is that every species not only wants to do that,
[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:15.200]   but need to do that.
[02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:17.980]   And the feeling of love is really what allows us
[02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:18.960]   to be adaptable.
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:22.040]   I don't think there's anything that trains up adaptability
[02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:23.680]   as much as being around kids.
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:26.220]   You just have to be adaptable, right?
[02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:28.440]   'Cause one moment they're up, then they're down,
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:29.680]   then they're disappointed.
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:33.760]   So, you know, and you shared a really important story
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:36.680]   about loss of somebody that clearly you loved.
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:40.800]   And that clearly loved the community he worked in.
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:43.300]   It wasn't just that you guys loved him,
[02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:45.400]   it's that he loved you guys.
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:48.820]   And I think that being able to tap into these feelings
[02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:52.240]   of love for things, for people and for experiences,
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:53.840]   I think is so critical.
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:57.080]   And, you know, I don't meditate much these days,
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:33:59.760]   but I have heard of this like love and kindness meditation.
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:01.480]   And I would sound so soft to me.
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:03.120]   I was thinking like, gosh, what am I supposed to do?
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:05.560]   Then float, like levitate at the end and like wear a,
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:08.000]   you know, a moo moo or whatever it's called.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.440]   I don't know what's the thing.
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:12.280]   But my friend who I'm fortunate to call a friend,
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:13.280]   not trying to name drop here,
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:14.580]   but I'm very fortunate to call Rick Rubin,
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:16.240]   the music producer, a friend.
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:18.780]   And he was the one who started turning me on
[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:20.100]   to different forms of meditation.
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:21.500]   The ones I mentioned before in this idea
[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:23.380]   that there are forms of meditation,
[02:34:23.380 --> 02:34:27.780]   which put us in touch with what he calls the source.
[02:34:27.780 --> 02:34:29.380]   Now this is really getting a little mystical,
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:31.820]   but I think this all maps back to the same thing,
[02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:34.620]   which is that there are sources of dopamine
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:36.740]   and the other neurotransmitters in us
[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:41.740]   that give us kind of a superpower to adapt to anything.
[02:34:41.780 --> 02:34:46.780]   And I think it's at least includes love
[02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:49.680]   because that's the most adaptable emotion by definition
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:51.540]   because of what's required for evolution.
[02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:55.360]   So the question therefore is in yourself
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.540]   and in your observation of people that you've worked with,
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:01.760]   did you ever sense that just being hard driving
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.780]   was kind of, it was great, but it was limiting?
[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:07.060]   Like, did you ever sense that like,
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:08.680]   by liking the people you work with,
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:10.260]   you could perform much better?
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:14.620]   Even if they perhaps were not as hard
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:17.960]   to kind of borrow the common parlance around this,
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:19.700]   they weren't as hard as everybody else
[02:35:19.700 --> 02:35:22.900]   that because you like each other so, so much
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:24.880]   that you can kind of do anything?
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:28.880]   - Well, if you have a team of 10 people
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:30.400]   and you all have a great relationship
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.600]   and you get along well, and you're going against my team
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:35.500]   and we all hate each other and who's going to win?
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:36.960]   - The team that loves each other is going to win,
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:37.800]   I would hope.
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:38.800]   - It's not even close.
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:41.340]   As a matter of fact, if you work for me
[02:35:41.340 --> 02:35:43.100]   and you don't like me,
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.880]   what kind of performance are you going to give me?
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:45.780]   - It's going to be tough.
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:48.560]   - What if you love me and I've looked out for you
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:50.860]   and I've done everything for you and I've taken care of you,
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:52.280]   what kind of performance are you going to give me?
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:54.120]   - I'm like a dog, I'd die for you.
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:58.200]   - So yeah, and you know, earlier you asked about
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.120]   the human animal and human nature
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:03.800]   and this is part of leadership.
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:05.680]   I got asked this question the other day by,
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:07.920]   I was working with a company and the guy says,
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.960]   how do I identify,
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:12.500]   what are the characteristics of someone that can execute
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:16.680]   and how do I identify those characteristics in a person
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:18.820]   so that I can get those people?
[02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:22.560]   And I said, well, first of all,
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:24.320]   the characteristics are the characteristics
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:26.280]   that everybody's obviously someone that's driven,
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:27.280]   someone that can communicate well,
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:28.480]   someone that's going to make things happen.
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:31.480]   Those are pretty simple to know, we know what they are.
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:32.360]   How do you identify them?
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:34.060]   It's pretty simple as well.
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.520]   I give you a task, I give Andrew a task.
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:37.880]   It's a pretty simple task.
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:39.520]   If you get it done, cool.
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:41.680]   Give you a little bit more complex task.
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:42.520]   Do you get it done?
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:43.360]   Yes.
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:45.540]   I give the same task to Fred, he doesn't get it done.
[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:46.960]   He comes back with a bunch of questions.
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:49.640]   He slow rolls, he's got all kinds of excuses and problems.
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:51.320]   I give you an even more complex task.
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:53.200]   You come back, you get it done.
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:54.520]   And then I'm going to realize,
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:56.760]   okay, Andrew's the guy that makes things happen.
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:59.480]   He's a guy that can actually execute.
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:02.440]   And a little bit what you said,
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:03.900]   I mean, there's certain breeds of dogs,
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:08.900]   but even that is, they're not as different
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:12.860]   as human beings are, right?
[02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:15.360]   And there are some, so now there are some guys,
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:18.220]   I've got Andrew who will make things happen.
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:19.860]   Here's the problem with Andrew.
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:24.300]   When I say, hey Andrew, here's this nebulous idea
[02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:26.800]   that I have, can you turn this into a reality?
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:29.180]   And you're like, where do I start?
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.980]   I'm not sure where you want me to go.
[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:32.200]   Meanwhile, I gave it to the guy
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:34.000]   that didn't make anything happen
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.120]   with specific tasks that I gave him.
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:37.440]   And he comes back and says,
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:38.880]   you know, I say, hey, I got this nebulous idea.
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:40.640]   Can you see what you, he goes, oh yeah.
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:42.280]   And all of a sudden he takes it and he says,
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:43.960]   hey, I figured out a way to make this happen.
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:46.640]   So you might have someone that's very good at executing,
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:47.820]   but they're not very creative.
[02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:49.480]   I might have somebody that's very creative,
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.320]   but they're not very good at executing.
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:52.480]   So what do I do?
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:54.880]   I build a team where I've got Andrew and Fred
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:56.060]   and they work together.
[02:37:56.060 --> 02:37:58.020]   And Fred comes up with good ideas
[02:37:58.020 --> 02:37:59.200]   and we bring them to Andrew
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:00.780]   and Andrew goes and executes them.
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:04.000]   So that's what we're doing from a leadership perspective
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.740]   is we're letting people's nature
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:12.360]   execute and we're putting people into roles
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:15.200]   where their nature is beneficial.
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:18.600]   I'm not gonna take someone that's shy and introverted
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:19.960]   and put them out in the lead sales role.
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:21.820]   I'm not gonna take somebody that's boisterous
[02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:24.460]   and extroverted and put them into a cubicle
[02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:27.060]   where they're gonna be looking at spreadsheets all day.
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:28.620]   Clearly I'm not gonna do that.
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.180]   So what we have to do as leaders
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:32.720]   is we have to find the right people for the right role
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:34.340]   and we place them into those roles.
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:36.980]   Now, does it mean that I abandon all hope
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:38.260]   that the guy that's an introvert
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:41.340]   will ever develop more communication skills?
[02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:42.720]   No, I'm still gonna work with him.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:44.680]   And over time, we'll get him a little bit
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:46.540]   moving in the right direction,
[02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:51.320]   but I'm not gonna take somebody that's a total introvert
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:53.040]   and turn them into a lead sales guy.
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.360]   That's not going to happen
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.340]   any more than I'm gonna change a tiger stripes.
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:57.960]   So that's what we have to do
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:01.360]   is we have to help people, as leaders,
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:03.120]   we have to help people find the role
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.520]   and find the thing that they're good at.
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:10.340]   Now, does that mean if I have someone that loves their job,
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:12.000]   they're gonna do better at it?
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.400]   Absolutely.
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:16.360]   Does it mean that if I have somebody that's driven
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.200]   just by achievement,
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:20.960]   that they're gonna be good at their job?
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:23.240]   No, in fact, well, they can be.
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.400]   There's gonna be certain roles I can put them in, right?
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:26.940]   If I've got a sales number I need to hit
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:29.340]   and Andrew's super into achievement.
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:31.140]   He wants to be the golden child
[02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:34.140]   and wants to have his picture on the, you know,
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:37.120]   magazine that we put out about our industry.
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:39.700]   Cool, I can throw this task at you
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:42.160]   and you're gonna go and get it.
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:44.640]   The problem is if there's something
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:46.840]   that's gonna take more perseverance
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:50.240]   and the reward isn't that high or it's a long-term goal,
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:52.680]   you're probably not the right guy for the job.
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:57.680]   So liking your job is absolutely critical
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:58.660]   and if you love your job,
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.920]   you're gonna be able to most likely excel at it.
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:03.380]   Now, you could be an unfortunate person
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:05.960]   that loves your job and is not good at it.
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.380]   That happens occasionally, right?
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:10.300]   - Yeah, but it seems pretty rare.
[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:12.100]   - It reminds me of your skateboarding career.
[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:13.500]   - Yeah. - You love skateboarding,
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:14.940]   but you just weren't that good at it.
[02:40:14.940 --> 02:40:15.780]   - I wasn't that good at it. - Unfortunately.
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:18.160]   - But you know what I loved more than skateboarding?
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:19.940]   I loved the community I was in.
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:21.460]   I loved the community I was in
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:24.100]   and I probably would have gone to the industry side
[02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:25.520]   or worked on a company side
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:27.680]   and not been on the actual skateboard side
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:29.280]   or just skateboard for fun.
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:30.900]   So there's a guy in the skateboard community,
[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:31.900]   his name is Jim Thiebaud
[02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:35.300]   and he's kind of the not so hidden secret in that community.
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:38.380]   He's an amazing guy and he's sort of early on
[02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:41.180]   left professional skateboarding to run a company,
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:42.700]   Real Deluxe, a bunch of other companies.
[02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:44.540]   He's an amazing guy and he told me,
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:46.220]   we'd become friends recently and he said,
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:48.700]   he realized he wasn't gonna be one of the big guys,
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:50.400]   but he knew he wanted to be in this community
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:51.780]   so he found his place.
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:53.620]   And I think everyone in skateboarding looks to Jim
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:55.380]   as like the guy who cares.
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:57.260]   He's, you know, he cares,
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:41:00.280]   he truly cares about the sport and about the people.
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:02.060]   And so he learned to kind of just wrap his arms
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:04.420]   and his heart around the whole thing and it just works.
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:08.680]   And so I do think everyone has a certain place
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:10.360]   in a community or in a team.
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:11.940]   I think that as you're describing this,
[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:13.540]   I have to imagine that people are listening
[02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:18.540]   and thinking like, wow, this team thing is awesome.
[02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:19.980]   Like, it's just amazing.
[02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:21.440]   I wish I had that, right?
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:23.240]   I'm fortunate to have that in my podcast.
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:26.140]   I've had that in my lab, certainly in my podcast team.
[02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:29.580]   I always say, these guys go, I go.
[02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:32.580]   Like it's not just the people that press buttons
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:34.520]   and run equipment, take photos, like they go, I go.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:36.820]   Like they go, it's over and I'm fine with that.
[02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:39.000]   I actually love that because it's, yes,
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.340]   it's about the podcast and about the information
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:43.780]   and getting it out there, but it's as much about the team
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:45.840]   and working together just like it was with skateboarding.
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.880]   So hopefully I'm better at podcasting
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:48.720]   than I was at the skateboarding.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.400]   I'm kind of getting broke off as the skateboarders say
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.400]   and skateboarding too often.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:54.320]   But I want to ask, like in your family life,
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:55.740]   do you look at that as a team?
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:57.740]   Like, do you think like this is my team
[02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:00.320]   and they're different and how can we synergize?
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:02.360]   - Yeah, and you've got to look at every team like that.
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:04.360]   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the team
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:06.080]   and who's going to be good at what
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:08.480]   and how do you put people in positions
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:10.360]   where they're going to be able to excel?
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.640]   I mean, what's his name, Tebow?
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:13.480]   - Jim Tebow.
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:14.760]   - Jim Tebow.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:18.340]   Imagine if he had a mentor that was only saying,
[02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:20.680]   listen, you got to be a pro skater.
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:21.960]   This is your only opportunity.
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.060]   There's nothing else.
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:25.380]   And he didn't have the ability to take a step back
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:26.880]   and say, you know what, man?
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.780]   Like, I'm not going to be good enough,
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:31.520]   but I really love this industry.
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:36.360]   So luckily for him, he figured that out.
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:38.440]   And you know, you talked about the superpower
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:40.340]   of being like loving your job.
[02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:42.560]   The one thing I claim to be a superpower
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:45.040]   is the ability to take a step back and detach,
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:46.920]   which I guess is going back to your meditation thing.
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:51.400]   But being able to take a step back and look at your life
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:54.340]   and say, man, I've been skateboarding longer than that guy
[02:42:54.340 --> 02:42:55.320]   and he's better than me.
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:56.940]   And I've been skateboarding longer than that other guy
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:58.140]   and he's better than me.
[02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:00.500]   I'm probably not going to be,
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:02.420]   this is probably not the right job for me.
[02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:05.780]   What could I do where I could use my skillset?
[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:08.620]   And obviously he had some entrepreneurial spirit
[02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:10.060]   and was able to figure that out.
[02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:12.940]   So being able to be a part of a team,
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:15.540]   and it goes to what I was saying earlier about the mob,
[02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:17.020]   being able to be part of a team,
[02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:18.940]   part of the mob, part of the gang,
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:20.660]   but still have the ability to take a step back,
[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:24.700]   detach from that and assess what is the best way
[02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:26.720]   for this team to move forward.
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:29.240]   I mean, you could have this brilliant idea
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:33.140]   that from now on, you're going to make all of your podcasts
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:37.360]   about the molecular structure of whatever.
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:40.940]   And you know, the rest of the team
[02:43:40.940 --> 02:43:42.680]   probably need to pull you aside and say, hey man,
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:45.300]   like I know you really care about that and that's awesome,
[02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:49.700]   but everyone really wants to hear about this other stuff.
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:51.420]   So let's tie it in together.
[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:54.640]   Let's expand this specific thing you want to talk about.
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:56.940]   So being able to take a step back, detach,
[02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:58.340]   and see the bigger picture,
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:03.340]   to me is the true superpower of life, of life.
[02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:06.700]   And it's a lot harder than it sounds.
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:10.060]   And you know, this goes back to when you start talking
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:12.660]   about people that are having,
[02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:14.860]   going through struggles in life, right?
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:17.540]   And I've described this before as, you know,
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:22.040]   if I'm looking at you and you're in a bad state, right?
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:25.120]   You're depressed, you're sad, you're moping around,
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:26.820]   you're not getting anything done.
[02:44:26.820 --> 02:44:30.300]   And I'm looking at you from the outside
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:31.780]   and I'm thinking for me,
[02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.040]   I see this storm cloud around your head, right?
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:38.660]   I see the storm cloud around your head and you're in there.
[02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:43.100]   And all you see, no matter what direction you look is storm.
[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:44.980]   All you see is darkness.
[02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:46.140]   I'm outside and I'm looking and I'm like,
[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:48.660]   "Hey man, this guy's got a great education, he's healthy.
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:50.420]   He's got a good team around him.
[02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:52.020]   Like he's got all these things going for him."
[02:44:52.020 --> 02:44:57.020]   But you in that state, you literally cannot see anything
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:00.100]   but the darkness of the storm.
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:04.940]   And that's what's so scary about when people enter that mode
[02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:07.560]   is you can look, I can look at it from the outside
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:10.480]   and be like, "Andrew, you just got to move like four feet
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:13.000]   forward and you're going to be through this thing."
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.260]   And yet you might hear me say that and you go,
[02:45:15.260 --> 02:45:16.400]   "No, Jaco, I'm looking ahead.
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:18.440]   There's nothing but darkness."
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:21.900]   So helping people move forward, take action
[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:24.660]   and be able to get that perspective, detach
[02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:28.400]   and get outside themselves, get outside their own heads.
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.400]   Tim Ferriss said, "Get out of your head, get into your body.
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:33.540]   That's one way to do it, take action, go do things."
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:37.220]   But it's very scary and I'm sure you've had this experience
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:39.260]   where you're talking to someone that you know
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:43.600]   and they're bogged down in whatever problem it is,
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:47.240]   whatever stress they're under and you're looking at them
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:49.720]   going, "Hey man, it's going to be okay."
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:54.480]   Like you can clearly see that whatever is bothering them
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:57.040]   and dragging them, now you can clearly see,
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:58.840]   a lot of times it's a relationship, right?
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:01.960]   The girl, the guy, they got dumped and you go,
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:03.900]   "Hey man, that person was a disaster anyways.
[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:05.520]   You're better off without them."
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:07.600]   And they cannot compute that.
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:10.140]   They are stuck there or maybe it's the school
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:12.420]   that they didn't get into or the job that they didn't get
[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:14.420]   and they get so wrapped up in that,
[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:17.200]   they can't get out of that storm.
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:22.000]   And it's such a helpless feeling to sit there
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:27.000]   and tell someone, "Hey, you just move a little bit
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.840]   towards me and you're going to get out of this storm."
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:33.560]   And it's so much easier said than done.
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:36.060]   And that's why trying to engage with people
[02:46:36.060 --> 02:46:38.400]   and trying to give people that super power of detachment
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:39.500]   where they can take a step back and say,
[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:41.200]   "You know what, you're right, man.
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:45.000]   That girl, she wasn't who I really thought she was.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:45.840]   I should move on."
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:50.600]   Yes, but easier said than done.
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:51.720]   And that's one of the biggest challenges,
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:55.320]   I think that we have as friends and in parents
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:00.320]   and teammates is helping people learn to detach,
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:04.120]   learn to see the bigger picture,
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.520]   learn to see that the problem that you have,
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:10.660]   that your whole world is actually not that big of a deal.
[02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:12.500]   You know what I wrote, I've written a bunch of kids' books
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:16.400]   and one of the things that triggered me to write kids' books
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:20.240]   is realizing that, you know, one day my daughter came home,
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:23.840]   it's my oldest daughter and she came home from school
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.840]   and she's like, she says, "I'm stupid."
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:28.240]   What do you mean you're stupid?
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:30.280]   I'm stupid, I'm dumb, why do you think that?
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:31.400]   You know what, whatever grade it is
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:33.220]   when you're supposed to know your times tables.
[02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:34.880]   I don't know my times tables.
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:37.580]   I said, "Oh, well, how much have you studied?"
[02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:40.960]   She kind of gave me the confused look.
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:43.220]   What do you mean studied?
[02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:45.300]   I said, "Have you studied yet?
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:48.000]   Have you made flashcards to learn them?"
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:49.800]   And she didn't, she hadn't.
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:51.440]   She thought she should just know them.
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:52.860]   From, you know, the teacher went over what they are
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:53.700]   and now she should know them
[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:55.400]   like some other kids in the class did.
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:58.640]   And so I'm sitting there going, "Oh yeah, cool.
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:00.300]   We'll just, you know, we'll make some flashcards."
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:01.140]   And she made flashcards
[02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:03.180]   and she learned her times tables in 45 minutes
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:04.120]   and we were good.
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.920]   But what struck me was, to me, I was like,
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:08.780]   "Oh, no big deal."
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:10.220]   To her, it was her whole life.
[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:12.560]   And then I got to see that with my other kids.
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:13.960]   You know, somebody said something to them
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:16.820]   in the recess yard and I'm like, "Oh, screw that kid.
[02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:19.220]   They don't know what the, don't worry about them."
[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:23.700]   But when you're, that's their whole world.
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:27.460]   And that unfortunately doesn't only apply to kids.
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:29.360]   It applies to adults as well.
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:33.540]   And they get this problem in their world
[02:48:33.540 --> 02:48:37.340]   that seems so insurmountable and so massive
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:40.140]   because that little ecosystem that they're stuck in
[02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:41.420]   is their world.
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:43.580]   And they run into this problem in that
[02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:45.880]   and it's disruptive in that world
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:47.220]   and they don't know how to get out of it.
[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:50.280]   You know, I did a podcast talking about these ecosystems
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:51.460]   that people get into, right?
[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:52.460]   And there's all these ecosystems.
[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:53.800]   You're in an ecosystem.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.060]   We're both in a shared ecosystem of podcasting.
[02:48:57.060 --> 02:49:00.800]   And we could be like, "Oh my gosh, you know,
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:03.200]   Lex just came out with a new podcast
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.200]   and it's been the biggest success.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:08.600]   And what can I do to catch up with Lex?"
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:10.240]   And all of a sudden I could get really bothered.
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:11.180]   You could get really bothered.
[02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:12.480]   We could be bothered by that
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:14.380]   and think, "Man, I'm a failure."
[02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:17.220]   Meanwhile, there's people that don't listen to podcasts.
[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:19.680]   There's people that don't even know what a podcast is.
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:22.580]   And yet it's our whole world, if we let it be.
[02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:23.960]   You're in the academic world.
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:28.000]   Hey, you go, you're a professor at Stanford,
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.100]   which is a big deal in that world.
[02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:34.840]   I know people that don't give a rat's ass.
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:37.160]   They couldn't, they don't know where Stanford is.
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:38.100]   - I get that all the time.
[02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:39.040]   - They don't know where Stanford is.
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:39.880]   It's no big deal.
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:41.240]   In the SEAL teams, same thing.
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:43.680]   Somebody has a problem in the SEAL teams
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:47.440]   and they think this is the whole world and I blew it.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:49.180]   And now what are they gonna do?
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:52.420]   When you're facing a significant problem in life,
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:54.460]   a relationship, a problem with a job,
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.680]   you gotta remember that you're in one ecosystem.
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:58.480]   And if you step outside of that ecosystem,
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:00.360]   no one really cares.
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:03.660]   And you could go move into a totally different ecosystem
[02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:05.560]   and find happiness there.
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:09.400]   But at least utilize that to get out of that storm cloud
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:11.400]   that you're in and you're gonna find
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:13.280]   that there's plenty of light out there in the world.
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:16.800]   Move towards that and it's gonna be a much better situation.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:20.040]   - In the spirit of authenticity,
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:24.220]   everything you're saying hits directly home for me.
[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:26.040]   I don't know what people's perceptions of me are.
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:27.600]   I actually try not to spend too much time
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:29.200]   thinking about that and just really try
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.480]   and stay in touch with the source.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:33.740]   And I really do believe in this notion
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:36.520]   that our love of things is what can generate energy.
[02:50:36.520 --> 02:50:38.640]   And I try and use action to generate energy,
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:40.560]   but also I happen to also love exercise.
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:41.960]   So that's an easy one there for me,
[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:44.080]   but I try and stay in that mode.
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:48.400]   But to be quite honest, I've spent much of my adult life
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:53.400]   and probably too much of my teenage life in twenties,
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:55.320]   you're not quite an adult, right, in your twenties,
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:51:00.320]   at least I certainly wasn't, in challenging relationships.
[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:03.960]   That admittedly were challenging
[02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:07.540]   because of my role in them also, of course, right?
[02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:10.680]   And each and every time I remember thinking
[02:51:10.680 --> 02:51:14.180]   moving on from this is like this insurmountable thing.
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:17.040]   In part because I'm a caretaker and I cared
[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.400]   and it wasn't just about me and a selfishness,
[02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:21.240]   it was about wanting to right all the wrongs
[02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:23.440]   of that person's past.
[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:26.120]   I found myself trying to be a time machine for people.
[02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:28.280]   I found myself trying to fix their family lives.
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:30.320]   I found myself doing all of that
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:32.620]   and also ignoring all the things I needed to focus on
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:33.860]   in terms of bettering myself
[02:51:33.860 --> 02:51:38.020]   and making sure I was showing up correct and on and on.
[02:51:38.020 --> 02:51:40.840]   And there are data in the world
[02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:43.920]   in the form of these people that know me very, very well
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:47.660]   that I think would say that and a whole lot more, right?
[02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:49.600]   The point isn't those specific relationships,
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:54.600]   but each and every time, someone would come along and say,
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:57.900]   listen, if this isn't good for you, it's not good for them,
[02:51:57.900 --> 02:51:59.380]   or this is a bad situation,
[02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:00.860]   or this isn't serving either of you well.
[02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:03.920]   But I was like myopic, this big in the,
[02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:05.540]   not even so distraught view of the world,
[02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:09.040]   like sand speck of the world and trying to solve,
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:09.880]   'cause that's my nature.
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:11.060]   Like I'm going to solve this, I'm going to solve it,
[02:52:11.060 --> 02:52:12.200]   I'm going to solve it.
[02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:14.580]   And sometimes things were solved for some period of time
[02:52:14.580 --> 02:52:15.900]   and sometimes they weren't.
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:20.260]   And I think one thing that just as a confessional,
[02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:24.900]   like I will say, I could really learn
[02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:26.780]   the art of detachment.
[02:52:26.780 --> 02:52:31.100]   I could really learn to focus on that more,
[02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:32.300]   if that's the proper language word.
[02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:35.180]   I think I'm pretty good at adapting.
[02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:37.420]   I think I'm pretty good at finding good people.
[02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:39.520]   I'm certainly love my team
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:41.820]   and that all feels like natural synergy,
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:44.300]   although it's hard work in lab and in the podcast.
[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:49.300]   But I think the tendency that I have as a problem solver
[02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:51.660]   is to assume that every problem can be solved
[02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:53.220]   and therefore staying on this problem
[02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:55.900]   until it is solved is the answer.
[02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:58.980]   And maybe the art of detachment
[02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:00.300]   and getting some perspective would help,
[02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:01.640]   because if I look back,
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:04.300]   I certainly don't regret the experiences that I've had,
[02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:06.360]   but I wasted far too much time.
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:08.320]   And frankly, I probably wasted far too much
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:10.960]   of other people's time trying to solve problems
[02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:12.820]   that could not be solved.
[02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:17.180]   And I think without going into this in any more detail,
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:22.380]   and of course, you can send me a bill at the end, by the way,
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:23.220]   I think this is-
[02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:24.060]   - Confessions are free, man.
[02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:26.660]   - Yeah, so I think that being a problem solver is great.
[02:53:26.660 --> 02:53:28.120]   Being forward center of mass is great.
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:30.540]   I think learning the systems of the brain and body
[02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:34.460]   and understanding psychology and learning about oneself,
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:36.720]   the oracle had it right, know thyself,
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:39.900]   in ways that you can maneuver functionally in your life
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:41.920]   and career and relationship, et cetera, great.
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:46.100]   But I think there's also a downside to being overly fixated.
[02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:47.380]   It was like my bulldog, Costello,
[02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:49.100]   used to be chewing on something, chewing on something.
[02:53:49.100 --> 02:53:51.660]   Next thing I know, he's chewing on his foot.
[02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:52.500]   And you're like, hey,
[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:54.000]   and you'd have to rip him off his own foot
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:55.700]   and he'd be like, ah, ah, ah,
[02:53:55.700 --> 02:53:57.700]   'cause that chew reflex was just so strong
[02:53:57.700 --> 02:53:59.520]   that sometimes it would turn on himself.
[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.540]   That's kind of how it feels.
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:03.060]   - Yeah, I wrote a book called
[02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:04.340]   "Leadership Strategy and Tactics,"
[02:54:04.340 --> 02:54:06.660]   and one of the things that I wrote about in that book
[02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:09.400]   is understanding what's important and what's not.
[02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:12.740]   And this is very similar to what you're talking about.
[02:54:12.740 --> 02:54:17.020]   Looking at a problem and taking a step back and going,
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:19.700]   well, A, is this important or not?
[02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:21.980]   And B, is this solvable or is it not?
[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:24.100]   And C, what's the ROI on getting it solved
[02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:25.120]   and what's the effort it's gonna take
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:25.980]   to get this problem solved
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:29.300]   and how much is it really gonna impact my world and my life
[02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:31.620]   if I focus on it?
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:35.380]   So knowing and understanding when something's important
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:38.060]   or not is a very good skill.
[02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:39.900]   And again, it's a skill that's directly related
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:41.400]   to attachment, detachment,
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:43.760]   because when you're in that relationship,
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:45.180]   this is another thing I've been telling people lately,
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:48.320]   the solution to your problem
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:50.320]   is not gonna be found in the problem.
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:51.600]   It's not gonna be found in there.
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:53.400]   You have to get out of the problem
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:56.040]   so that you can look at it, make an assessment,
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:57.800]   and you can assess how to solve the problem
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:00.040]   or whether you need to solve the problem or not.
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.220]   I mean, there's a lot of things in my life right now
[02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:07.220]   where I shrug my shoulders and go, okay, okay.
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:10.140]   Someone's saying this, okay.
[02:55:10.140 --> 02:55:15.140]   Roger that, like carry on, no factor, move on.
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:17.940]   And then occasionally you go, okay,
[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:19.220]   this is something I need to contend with.
[02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:20.140]   This is something I need to deal with.
[02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:22.220]   This is something I need to shape or adjust or move
[02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:26.160]   or solve, to use your word.
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:28.300]   The reason I laugh when I say that
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:33.300]   is because problems, you have to get in there,
[02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:36.380]   but if you take a step back, you can usually say,
[02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:38.580]   oh, a little adjustment here, a little adjustment there.
[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:40.700]   And that thing's gonna sort itself out.
[02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:43.440]   So detachment is a super power, man.
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:45.540]   - Certainly is.
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:47.820]   And it's certainly one that I need to focus on more.
[02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:51.220]   I'm grateful for bringing that up.
[02:55:51.220 --> 02:55:56.100]   This is the biologist in me, but you know,
[02:55:56.100 --> 02:55:58.980]   what is your process for engaging detachment
[02:55:58.980 --> 02:56:00.420]   or for disengaging?
[02:56:00.420 --> 02:56:02.260]   Is it an active process where you go,
[02:56:02.260 --> 02:56:04.060]   you know, I'm gonna detach from this.
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:05.520]   I'm gonna put myself in a situation
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.180]   that is pulling on me.
[02:56:07.180 --> 02:56:08.660]   There's this gravitational force
[02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:11.300]   and I'm gonna create some imagery in my mind
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:12.480]   of walking away from it.
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:14.480]   Do I physically walk away from it?
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:15.940]   Do I outsource it to somebody else?
[02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:18.340]   What are some tools for detachment?
[02:56:18.340 --> 02:56:19.980]   - Yeah, this is one of those situations
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:22.800]   where you and I had a discussion about the science
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:26.180]   and the practical application aligned.
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:31.060]   So my original experience with detachment was,
[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:33.000]   and this is one of those moments where, you know,
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.580]   I said a lot of times things are just small moments over time
[02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:36.740]   and you make a little adjustment.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:39.940]   This is one of those moments in my life.
[02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:41.620]   And I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:46.220]   where I recognized like in a moment
[02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:48.820]   what detachment was and how helpful it was.
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:53.380]   I'm on an oil rig doing a training mission.
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:56.340]   My whole platoon is in a skirmish line
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:56:59.980]   looking at a large area of the oil rig
[02:56:59.980 --> 02:57:01.180]   that we're supposed to be clearing.
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:03.100]   Again, this is not combat, this is in the 90s,
[02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:05.360]   there's nothing going on, we're just doing training.
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:07.840]   And I'm standing in this skirmish line.
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:09.080]   And by the way, I'm the youngest
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:10.420]   and most junior guy in my platoon.
[02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:14.000]   And I'm standing there looking down the site of my weapon
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:15.640]   and I'm waiting for someone to make a call
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:16.740]   and tell us what to do.
[02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:20.260]   And I wait for five seconds and I wait for 10 seconds
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:22.840]   and I wait for 20 seconds and no one's saying anything.
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:25.920]   And we're waiting for a leader in my platoon
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.040]   to make a call to tell us what to do, tell me what to do.
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:31.860]   And finally after like 30 seconds,
[02:57:31.860 --> 02:57:35.620]   which seems like an eternity, I can't take it anymore.
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:40.620]   And so I take a step like a foot, one foot step, 12 inches,
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:43.580]   I take a step off the skirmish line.
[02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:45.300]   I look to my left, I look to my right
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:48.080]   and what I see is every other guy in my platoon
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:49.660]   is staring down their weapon.
[02:57:49.660 --> 02:57:51.540]   Staring down the site of their weapon
[02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:54.920]   which means their field of view is tiny.
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:56.660]   It's like a 20 degree field of view.
[02:57:56.660 --> 02:57:58.660]   You're looking down the scope of your weapon
[02:57:58.660 --> 02:58:00.140]   or the site of your weapon
[02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:01.500]   and that's how big their field of view is.
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:04.500]   I'm looking, I'm thinking, oh, there's my platoon commander,
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:06.800]   he's looking down the scope, the site of his weapon.
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:07.640]   There's my platoon chief,
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:08.660]   he's looking down the side of his weapon.
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:09.660]   There's my leading petty officer,
[02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:10.940]   he's looking down the side of his weapon.
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:11.980]   There's my assistant platoon commander,
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:14.020]   he's looking down the, so everyone in the platoon
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:15.340]   is looking down the side of their weapon
[02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:20.340]   which means they all have a very narrow field of vision.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:23.460]   Well, when I take a step back and look to my left
[02:58:23.460 --> 02:58:24.300]   and look to my right,
[02:58:24.300 --> 02:58:25.540]   guess what kind of field of vision I got?
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:26.720]   I got a massive one.
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:29.480]   I can see the whole scene and I can see exactly
[02:58:29.480 --> 02:58:31.720]   what it is we need to do.
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:34.300]   And at that moment, look, as a new guy,
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:35.560]   you need to keep your mouth shut.
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:37.400]   You don't say anything.
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:40.540]   And I'm thinking, well, but no one else is saying anything.
[02:58:40.540 --> 02:58:43.640]   So I muster up all the courage I can
[02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:47.560]   and I open my mouth and I say, hold left, clear right,
[02:58:47.560 --> 02:58:50.400]   which is a basic tactical call.
[02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:51.800]   Nope, nope, nope.
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:54.360]   This is not a patent level genius maneuver.
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:56.200]   It's just a normal call to make in a situation
[02:58:56.200 --> 02:58:57.040]   that we were in.
[02:58:57.040 --> 02:58:58.360]   I say, hold left, clear right.
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:00.880]   And I'm expecting to get kind of slapped,
[02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:02.480]   told, shut up, new guy.
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:04.180]   But instead, everyone just repeats the call,
[02:59:04.180 --> 02:59:05.960]   hold left, clear right, hold left, clear right.
[02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:08.660]   And we execute the maneuver and we finish the clearance
[02:59:08.660 --> 02:59:11.120]   of this oil rig and we get done.
[02:59:11.120 --> 02:59:12.900]   We get to the top of the oil rig,
[02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:13.840]   which means we cleared the whole thing.
[02:59:13.840 --> 02:59:17.060]   We're on the helo deck at the top and we go into a debrief.
[02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:19.120]   And now I'm expecting, okay, now I'm gonna get told,
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:20.280]   hey, what were you doing?
[02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:22.360]   You need to keep your mouth shut.
[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:23.680]   And instead, the platoon chief goes,
[02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:27.760]   hey, Johnco, good call on the cellar deck down there.
[02:59:27.760 --> 02:59:30.880]   And I was kind of like, yeah, that's right.
[02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:32.780]   But then I thought to myself, hold on a second.
[02:59:32.780 --> 02:59:36.740]   Why, if I'm the youngest, most junior guy in this platoon,
[02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:39.280]   why was I able to see what we needed to do
[02:59:39.280 --> 02:59:40.120]   and make that call?
[02:59:40.120 --> 02:59:41.440]   Why did that just happen?
[02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:45.400]   And then I realized it was 'cause I took a step back,
[02:59:45.400 --> 02:59:50.360]   to use your term, I broadened my field of view,
[02:59:50.360 --> 02:59:52.760]   which allowed me to think more clearly,
[02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:55.180]   'cause instead of being hyper-focused and narrowly focused,
[02:59:55.180 --> 02:59:57.240]   I broadened my range of vision.
[02:59:57.240 --> 03:00:00.060]   I took a breath before I made my call, right?
[03:00:00.060 --> 03:00:04.720]   I had to take a nice breath to speak clearly.
[03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:09.100]   And I realized that taking a step back and detaching,
[03:00:09.100 --> 03:00:11.560]   I got to see infinitely more
[03:00:11.560 --> 03:00:14.820]   than even the most experienced guys in my platoon.
[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:16.920]   And I started doing it all the time.
[03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:18.900]   And I started doing it in land warfare.
[03:00:18.900 --> 03:00:20.540]   I started doing it in urban combat.
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:23.640]   I started doing it in all these tactical training scenarios.
[03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:25.000]   These are just training, this is the 90s.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:26.140]   Started doing these training scenarios,
[03:00:26.140 --> 03:00:31.140]   and it always allowed me to see what we needed to do.
[03:00:31.140 --> 03:00:35.020]   And then I started doing it
[03:00:35.020 --> 03:00:37.000]   like when I was having conversations with people
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.580]   and having a conversation with my platoon chief,
[03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:39.700]   and I can see that he's starting
[03:00:39.700 --> 03:00:40.860]   to turn a little red in the face,
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:43.180]   and we're about to argue about something.
[03:00:43.180 --> 03:00:44.140]   I said, oh, wait a second.
[03:00:44.140 --> 03:00:45.220]   I'm taking a step back, look and go,
[03:00:45.220 --> 03:00:48.300]   he's getting mad right now, and he's the platoon chief.
[03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:51.580]   You better just deescalate this thing real quick.
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:53.200]   And I'd say, hey, you know what, chief, that sounds good.
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:56.940]   Let me go take a, let me go relook at the plan or whatever.
[03:00:56.940 --> 03:01:01.860]   And so I started to do this kinda with my normal life,
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:04.460]   was to not get wrapped up in my own emotions,
[03:01:04.460 --> 03:01:06.980]   not get wrapped up in the gunfight
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:09.060]   that was happening right in front of my face,
[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:12.580]   not to get wrapped up in the details of what was going on,
[03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:17.580]   but instead take a step back, detach, look around,
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.920]   and then you can make a much, much better decision.
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:24.660]   And it's not, it's exponential.
[03:01:24.660 --> 03:01:28.220]   If you're looking down the sights of your weapon
[03:01:28.220 --> 03:01:31.040]   and you take a step back and you look around,
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:33.480]   it's exponential how much more you can see.
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:36.000]   Now, listen, if you are the only person in a gunfight,
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:37.240]   it's gonna be harder for you to do that
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:39.580]   'cause you gotta be focused on whatever you're shooting at.
[03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:41.840]   But when you have 16 guys or 20 guys,
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:43.340]   they're all looking in the same direction,
[03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:44.960]   it's very easy to be the guy that goes,
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:48.980]   I'm gonna take a step back, look around, make a call.
[03:01:48.980 --> 03:01:52.020]   So when you talk about the mechanics,
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:56.480]   when I teach this to people now, the mechanics of it,
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:01:57.900]   take a step back.
[03:01:57.900 --> 03:02:00.240]   Literally, you and I are at a meeting,
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:01.080]   there's a bunch of people,
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:02.680]   this starts to get heated argument,
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:06.080]   I will literally push my chair back away from the table,
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:11.080]   change my perspective, open, widen my field of view.
[03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:15.140]   The other thing, like in the SEAL teams,
[03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:18.480]   you don't wanna sound panicked on the radio
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:21.040]   for a couple reasons.
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:22.820]   Number one, because when you panic on the radio,
[03:02:22.820 --> 03:02:23.900]   it's gonna cause other people to panic.
[03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:25.680]   Number two, if you panic on the radio
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:27.280]   and you sound panicked, everyone's gonna make fun of you.
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:29.020]   So when you get back from the mission,
[03:02:29.020 --> 03:02:32.080]   everything's gonna go, you sounded like a baby out there.
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:35.340]   So what would I do before I would key up my radio?
[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:38.000]   Take a breath.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:41.800]   And so here I'm manually slowing down my breath,
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:43.400]   I'm broadening my field of view.
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:48.400]   So if you're in a meeting or you're at the supermarket
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:52.140]   parking lot and someone starts to yell at you,
[03:02:52.140 --> 03:02:55.960]   take a step back, take a breath, broaden your field of view,
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:02:58.500]   detach from those emotions that you're having
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:01.060]   and make some space.
[03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:04.840]   And that's how I go through the mechanics of detachment.
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:07.000]   Now I can tell you right now,
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.440]   I mean, when you do this all the time,
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:12.160]   which I kind of do this all the time,
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:14.040]   I don't really have to like step back,
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:16.080]   but when you're starting to be able to try and do this,
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:18.200]   absolutely, make them, and I'll tell you,
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:20.560]   here's another like weird little nuance thing.
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:26.640]   Lift your chin up and put your hands down.
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:28.600]   Now this isn't, not in a combat situation,
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:30.440]   not in a fight, but here's the thing.
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:34.640]   When I get defensive, what am I gonna do?
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:36.080]   I'm gonna raise my hands up and put my chin down.
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:37.320]   That's like a fighting mode.
[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:39.000]   So if you and I are having a discussion
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.040]   and I'm starting to get heated and I'm starting to like,
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:42.800]   oh, he's not listening to me,
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:46.720]   instead of me putting my chin down and putting my hands
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:49.480]   like up to where I can put them in your face a little bit,
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:50.920]   no, I'm actually gonna take a step back.
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:53.200]   I'm gonna say, put my chin up.
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:54.880]   It changes my perspective a little bit more,
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:56.560]   changes my visual perspective,
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:58.720]   just changing the angle of my head.
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:00.600]   Take a step back, put my hands down.
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:01.600]   I'm not being in a defensive mood.
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:04.440]   I actually wanna hear what you have to say.
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:06.960]   And if I start listening to what you have to say
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:09.440]   and not talking, it's very hard to be detached
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:10.600]   when you're talking.
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:12.080]   It's another key component.
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:14.600]   You wanna detach, shut your mouth.
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:16.560]   So I'm in meetings, you know,
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:18.520]   in a bunch of different companies.
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:19.800]   I'm running, I have a bunch of,
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:21.220]   I own a bunch of different companies.
[03:04:21.220 --> 03:04:23.040]   I'm in a meeting in my companies.
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:24.600]   I'm not the one that's doing all the talking.
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:26.500]   In fact, I'm doing mostly listening.
[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:29.520]   When I'm in task unit bruiser, my task unit,
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:32.160]   I'm not sitting there giving the entire brief.
[03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:34.000]   No, I'm letting the platoon chief and the platoon
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:35.900]   commanders give those briefs.
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:37.960]   And that way I'm detached.
[03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:39.920]   I'm listening to what they have to say.
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:44.280]   I'm more capable of seeing what holes there are
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:47.600]   in their plans by not moving my mouth,
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:50.180]   not talking, I'm listening.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:52.800]   So those are some of the methodologies that I use
[03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:54.320]   and that I advise people to use
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:59.000]   in order to effectively start down the pathway
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.600]   of being able to detach in various scenarios.
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:03.880]   - I love it.
[03:05:04.720 --> 03:05:06.800]   Again, I'm saying I love it because I do love it.
[03:05:06.800 --> 03:05:07.640]   And thank you.
[03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:09.000]   I think it's a wonderful technique.
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:10.620]   We've talked before on your podcast
[03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:13.920]   and some of my listeners, maybe not all to this podcast,
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:16.600]   will be familiar with the fact that when we narrowly focus
[03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:19.400]   our gaze on one target, a number of things happen.
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:22.000]   Our visual world becomes constricted, of course,
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.760]   but also that we start slicing time more finely
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:27.640]   and the dopamine system tends to start doing a kind
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:30.640]   of anticipation and trying to guide and direct things
[03:05:30.640 --> 03:05:32.400]   in that narrow tunnel of view.
[03:05:32.400 --> 03:05:35.360]   Whereas when we literally take on panoramic visions
[03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:36.620]   and not necessarily moving our head around,
[03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:38.600]   although one could, but broadening our field of view
[03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:41.300]   or looking at a horizon, especially if we're walking,
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:42.520]   but getting that kind of,
[03:05:42.520 --> 03:05:44.880]   not kind of getting a broader field of view,
[03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:47.280]   we slice time differently.
[03:05:47.280 --> 03:05:50.340]   Things don't feel as imposing on us.
[03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:52.440]   This is the physiological substrate
[03:05:52.440 --> 03:05:54.000]   underlying what you're describing.
[03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.800]   And I think it goes a step further
[03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:00.980]   because in that open, larger aperture
[03:06:00.980 --> 03:06:04.200]   of visual understanding, there's an open larger window
[03:06:04.200 --> 03:06:08.120]   of cognitive understanding and new options start to surface.
[03:06:08.120 --> 03:06:09.580]   Right, I mean, I think this is,
[03:06:09.580 --> 03:06:12.140]   I've long been fascinated by the fact that this actually,
[03:06:12.140 --> 03:06:13.780]   I'll tell this real quick story.
[03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:17.740]   In 2015, I was, I went over to Spain
[03:06:17.740 --> 03:06:20.060]   to do some mountaineering with Wim Hof.
[03:06:20.060 --> 03:06:21.580]   Okay, this wasn't because I wanted a podcast.
[03:06:21.580 --> 03:06:22.520]   I didn't have any social media.
[03:06:22.520 --> 03:06:24.340]   I just went over there 'cause I'd heard this guy, Wim,
[03:06:24.340 --> 03:06:26.680]   contacted him, somehow arranged a trip for myself
[03:06:26.680 --> 03:06:29.080]   and I went over there and we did some crazy,
[03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:31.900]   dangerous mountaineering that I had no business doing.
[03:06:31.900 --> 03:06:35.520]   Almost ripped my left leg off in a stunt
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:37.800]   that was organized by others there
[03:06:37.800 --> 03:06:38.800]   that I never should have done.
[03:06:38.800 --> 03:06:43.020]   In any case, one day, I look and Wim is like crouched
[03:06:43.020 --> 03:06:44.860]   on the ground next to like a curb
[03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:46.880]   in this parking lot before a hike.
[03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:49.240]   He's down there on the ground with a little stick.
[03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:50.420]   And I was like, "What are you doing?"
[03:06:50.420 --> 03:06:51.720]   And he's like, "Look."
[03:06:51.720 --> 03:06:53.520]   And there were ants climbing up this thing.
[03:06:53.520 --> 03:06:58.520]   And he's like, "They're mountaineering this curb."
[03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:02.600]   And I thought, this guy's different, right?
[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:05.340]   But then I realized we were about to do the same thing
[03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:06.680]   up this big face.
[03:07:06.680 --> 03:07:09.040]   And I thought, wow, like he's able to think
[03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:11.140]   at these different scales and see similarities.
[03:07:11.140 --> 03:07:11.980]   I thought, that's pretty cool.
[03:07:11.980 --> 03:07:13.360]   I would have never stopped to look there
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:14.960]   and I still remember it, right?
[03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:16.320]   And was it profound?
[03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:17.160]   No.
[03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:17.980]   Was it interesting?
[03:07:17.980 --> 03:07:19.920]   Yeah, in the sense that things are happening
[03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:21.640]   at all scales all the time.
[03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:25.440]   And we think we know the scale to pay attention to
[03:07:25.440 --> 03:07:27.820]   and we think that that's the one that matters most.
[03:07:27.820 --> 03:07:29.400]   And I think it's fair to say that in a gunfight,
[03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:31.080]   like there is a scale that matters most,
[03:07:31.080 --> 03:07:34.360]   but new options, new perspectives actually come
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:35.960]   from that broader field of view,
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:37.180]   which is what you're describing.
[03:07:37.180 --> 03:07:38.920]   And later that day, it's interesting
[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:40.040]   because this group going up,
[03:07:40.040 --> 03:07:44.220]   some of them were really challenged in the climb.
[03:07:44.220 --> 03:07:47.220]   And we went back to this example
[03:07:47.220 --> 03:07:49.460]   of how the ants would stack on top of one another.
[03:07:49.460 --> 03:07:50.780]   And he used an analogy from that
[03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:52.060]   to help people through this climb.
[03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:53.420]   And there was a beautiful pool at the top,
[03:07:53.420 --> 03:07:54.380]   et cetera, et cetera.
[03:07:54.380 --> 03:07:56.860]   Anyway, I think that these examples
[03:07:56.860 --> 03:07:58.140]   are in fact meaningful,
[03:07:58.140 --> 03:07:59.440]   especially the ones that you gave,
[03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:01.920]   because they don't just relate to military.
[03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:03.560]   I mean, you can imagine around the dinner table,
[03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:04.400]   I've had this, you know,
[03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:06.240]   kids are there and partners there.
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:08.360]   And sometimes it's really nice to sit back
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:11.220]   and just kind of hear it all and bask in it all.
[03:08:11.220 --> 03:08:14.640]   But oftentimes like new information will surface.
[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:15.480]   Like you said, you know,
[03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:17.900]   like all I'm hearing is worries out of this person
[03:08:17.900 --> 03:08:19.000]   or they're not even really here.
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.160]   They're all talking about what we're going to do next,
[03:08:21.160 --> 03:08:22.600]   next time, next time, next time.
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:24.520]   And kind of like you re-anchor people to like,
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:27.040]   hey, like maybe let's focus on what we're doing here.
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:28.660]   Or sometimes people are hyper-focused
[03:08:28.660 --> 03:08:29.500]   on what's happening there
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:31.320]   and they need to think about something in the future.
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:32.160]   I love this.
[03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:33.160]   I need to practice detachment
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:35.440]   in a number of different domains in my life.
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:38.340]   One thing that I'm realizing after hearing you
[03:08:38.340 --> 03:08:40.440]   describe the process that I really need to do
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:45.440]   is I need to start taking some time away from my work,
[03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:50.000]   maybe even a little bit of time parallel to relationship
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000]   to sort of get better perspective on it.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.800]   Because I think the problem solving nature in us
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:57.760]   really makes us myopic, really makes us nearsighted.
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:00.620]   - Yeah, that's, you see this a lot.
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:02.300]   I mean, I get to see this a lot.
[03:09:02.300 --> 03:09:05.700]   We do events with companies, businesses,
[03:09:05.700 --> 03:09:10.700]   and we go offsite somewhere where they're detached.
[03:09:10.700 --> 03:09:14.080]   They're just, they're de facto detached
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:16.680]   from their day-to-day business.
[03:09:16.680 --> 03:09:18.200]   You pull someone out of their business for two days
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:20.960]   and all of a sudden they start seeing the solutions.
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:22.600]   They never see them.
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.200]   It's a lot harder for them to see them
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:26.200]   when they're in the firefight.
[03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:27.360]   You get them out of the firefight.
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:28.460]   It's hard for them to see it
[03:09:28.460 --> 03:09:31.400]   when they're in that acquisition that they're doing.
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:33.000]   How are we gonna merge these two cultures?
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:34.280]   This is gonna be impossible.
[03:09:34.280 --> 03:09:35.560]   Boom, pull them out.
[03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:37.480]   All right, let's talk about the two cultures.
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:40.000]   And let's talk about what possible outcomes there are.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.740]   And all of a sudden when you get them to take a step back,
[03:09:42.740 --> 03:09:45.400]   the solutions will appear.
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:47.000]   And it is true in a gunfight.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.360]   Now listen, if it's a one-on-one gunfight,
[03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:53.080]   even then the ability to take a step back
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:56.320]   and look around or use your peripheral vision,
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:09:58.000]   you have to be able to do this.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.480]   It's gonna increase, it's exponential how much it,
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:02.880]   that's why it's like a superpower.
[03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:04.040]   It's like cheating.
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:05.520]   It's like cheating.
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:08.080]   You know, I was speaking of Seth Stone.
[03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:12.560]   Seth Stone took over, he became a task unit commander,
[03:10:12.560 --> 03:10:15.240]   a troop commander when we got back from Ramadi.
[03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:16.440]   And so now he's the guy in charge
[03:10:16.440 --> 03:10:18.520]   and now I was running the training.
[03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:22.780]   And a couple months into his training, he broke his neck,
[03:10:22.780 --> 03:10:26.320]   broke his vertebrae in his neck.
[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:28.220]   His spinal cord was okay.
[03:10:28.220 --> 03:10:31.040]   So he was, you know, the guy with the big neck brace on
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:33.220]   and he couldn't do any arduous training.
[03:10:33.220 --> 03:10:37.000]   And his SEAL task unit, which is two platoons,
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:40.080]   was going through their land warfare training.
[03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:41.120]   And he couldn't do it.
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:42.580]   He couldn't carry a rucksack,
[03:10:42.580 --> 03:10:44.640]   couldn't carry a machine gun, so he couldn't do it.
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:45.800]   So I said, hey, I'm coming out.
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:48.080]   Let's go out and you can observe your guys
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:49.880]   and see how they're doing.
[03:10:49.880 --> 03:10:51.840]   And so there we are, we're out in the desert.
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:54.760]   His troop is going through field training exercise
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:56.140]   or full mission profile.
[03:10:56.140 --> 03:10:57.600]   So it's like a big fake operation.
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:10:59.300]   There's a fake target, there's fake bad guys.
[03:10:59.300 --> 03:11:00.520]   We're using these laser,
[03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:02.880]   these high-speed laser guns to shoot.
[03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:06.520]   And we're kind of standing on this little berm.
[03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:10.180]   And at a certain point in the operation,
[03:11:10.180 --> 03:11:13.280]   his whole task unit, like 40 guys,
[03:11:13.280 --> 03:11:16.000]   gets pinned down in this little ravine.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:17.640]   And so we're kind of standing in the ravine
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:21.040]   with these guys and no one's making any decisions.
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:23.780]   And the enemy with these laser guns
[03:11:23.780 --> 03:11:25.560]   are starting to maneuver and starting to,
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:28.400]   they're killing guys 'cause these laser guns, you can die.
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:32.000]   And Seth, like, he hits me on the arm.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:33.400]   He's like, can I tell him what to do?
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:35.840]   And I was like, no, let him figure it out.
[03:11:35.840 --> 03:11:38.460]   So another 30 seconds pass,
[03:11:38.460 --> 03:11:41.000]   another guy gets killed with laser.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.760]   He hits me again, bro, let me say something to him.
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:46.080]   And I was like, no, let him figure it out.
[03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:49.980]   Another minute goes by, two more guys are now dead,
[03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:52.520]   just laser dead, but they're dead.
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:55.200]   And he hits me again and he's like, bro, let me tell him.
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:57.460]   And I go, all right, go ahead and tell him.
[03:11:57.460 --> 03:11:59.640]   And so he just crouches down next to one of the guys
[03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:02.460]   and bangs him on the shoulder, go, peel right.
[03:12:02.460 --> 03:12:06.840]   And which is, again, it's just a fundamental basic call.
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:08.520]   And the guy shouts it out, peel right,
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:09.360]   and they start peeling right.
[03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:10.520]   And another minute later,
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:13.640]   they're all out of the kill zone and everything's okay.
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:16.120]   And then Seth looks at me and he goes,
[03:12:16.120 --> 03:12:19.140]   man, this is so easy way up here.
[03:12:19.140 --> 03:12:23.960]   And I said, bro, look at where we are.
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:26.820]   We're in the ravine with the guys.
[03:12:26.820 --> 03:12:30.020]   We're, now we're on a knee and the guys are laying down,
[03:12:30.020 --> 03:12:33.960]   but it's not this, we weren't on some elevated position.
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:38.440]   And I said, hey, it's not that we're in an elevated position.
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.960]   It's just that we're detached and looking around.
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:41.940]   And he goes, oh my God.
[03:12:41.940 --> 03:12:43.320]   And I said, hey, you remember when you and I
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:44.360]   went through this training?
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:45.200]   And he goes, yeah.
[03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:48.040]   And I go, this is what it was like for me all the time.
[03:12:48.040 --> 03:12:50.400]   I was constantly just looking around.
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:53.360]   So that's why it seems like a magic power, right?
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:56.440]   It's like a superpower 'cause Seth's down there
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:57.760]   with his gun and he's shooting.
[03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:00.760]   I'm like, hey bro, move your guys over to that,
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:02.480]   go to that ridge line right there, set security, boom.
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:05.320]   And how did Jaco see that?
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:06.640]   Jaco must be a tactical genius.
[03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:08.320]   No, I'm not a tactical genius.
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:10.880]   I'm just taking a step back and looking around.
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:13.520]   And like you just said, it applies to everything
[03:13:13.520 --> 03:13:16.240]   that we do if you're having a conversation
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:18.120]   with your significant other and you
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:20.620]   start to see that they're getting
[03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:22.180]   frustrated about something.
[03:13:22.180 --> 03:13:26.220]   Now look, if you're in the conversation 100%,
[03:13:26.220 --> 03:13:27.640]   you're going to get frustrated too.
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:29.200]   You're going to get frustrated, they're frustrated.
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:33.040]   Next thing you know, you've got an emotional argument going on.
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:35.920]   Whereas if you can take a mental step back and say, wait a minute,
[03:13:35.920 --> 03:13:38.320]   why are they frustrated right now?
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:41.100]   Oh, because I'm trying to solve their problem
[03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:43.020]   when really what they're looking to do is vent.
[03:13:43.020 --> 03:13:44.200]   OK, got it.
[03:13:44.200 --> 03:13:44.800]   Let them vent.
[03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:45.480]   OK, cool.
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:47.080]   Oh, that sounds horrible.
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:48.640]   What do you think you're going to do?
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:49.880]   Instead of saying, well, if that's the problem,
[03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:50.500]   here's what you should do.
[03:13:50.500 --> 03:13:52.760]   Because people are always looking for that.
[03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:55.040]   So yeah, this thing, this ability is--
[03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:57.640]   and it's something that can absolutely be trained.
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:00.840]   And that's what's cool about it, can absolutely be trained.
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:03.240]   It's not a natural gift.
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:05.520]   Some people will be better at it than others.
[03:14:05.520 --> 03:14:07.280]   But it's something that you can train.
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:08.760]   And I used to see guys develop it.
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:10.920]   And I see people develop it now in the business world
[03:14:10.920 --> 03:14:13.840]   where they'll report back to me.
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:15.960]   You know, oh, we had a meeting with the union today.
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:19.000]   And the union started escalating what they wanted to do.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.080]   And I just detached.
[03:14:21.080 --> 03:14:22.640]   And we ended up de-escalating.
[03:14:22.640 --> 03:14:23.840]   And now we've got a solution.
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:27.360]   So this is an absolute skill set that can be learned.
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:31.680]   And that's what makes it especially nice.
[03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:36.520]   Because there's some people-- look, if you're very articulate,
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:39.040]   born very-- some people are born more articulate
[03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:40.040]   than other people.
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:43.280]   Some people are born with an ability
[03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:45.240]   to simplify things more than others.
[03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:46.040]   And you can train.
[03:14:46.040 --> 03:14:47.440]   You can become more articulate.
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:51.100]   You can learn to simplify things more.
[03:14:51.100 --> 03:14:53.800]   And some people are going to be naturally good at detaching.
[03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:56.040]   But everyone can get better at it.
[03:14:56.040 --> 03:14:57.800]   And that's a beautiful thing.
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:14:58.780]   It is a beautiful thing.
[03:14:58.780 --> 03:15:00.520]   And I'm highly incentivized to do this.
[03:15:00.520 --> 03:15:01.940]   I mean, there are areas of my life
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:05.040]   that are going really well that I also want to apply it there.
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:08.560]   I think that I've tended to rely on people close to me as a way
[03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:11.520]   to access this detachment.
[03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:14.740]   I will be very direct in saying that I am not
[03:15:14.740 --> 03:15:16.280]   the leader of my podcast.
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:17.340]   There is a leader.
[03:15:17.340 --> 03:15:18.920]   It is not me.
[03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:20.320]   I'm part of the team.
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:21.500]   But it is not me.
[03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:25.240]   And I often rely on his input.
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:27.260]   And sometimes that input is solicited.
[03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:28.960]   And sometimes it's not.
[03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:31.880]   One place, for instance, where you see people getting really
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:34.720]   myopic is on social media.
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:38.640]   And I've experienced this.
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:41.080]   I'd love to say that I'm always non-reactive.
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:45.160]   And I think, in general, I take the stance that I have filters.
[03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:47.480]   So I have filters.
[03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:48.960]   I know why I'm there.
[03:15:48.960 --> 03:15:50.800]   I'm interested in being a teacher and a giver
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:54.420]   and informing people about the beauty and utility of biology.
[03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:56.160]   That's why I say it's not a mission statement.
[03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:57.220]   It's a fact.
[03:15:57.220 --> 03:15:58.680]   That's what I care about.
[03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:01.060]   Anything that doesn't fit through that filter,
[03:16:01.060 --> 03:16:02.640]   I don't really have any business doing.
[03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:04.800]   But occasionally, I like to make a joke or something.
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:06.800]   But occasionally, something comes through.
[03:16:06.800 --> 03:16:08.680]   And I find myself, wait a second.
[03:16:08.680 --> 03:16:11.480]   And you get sucked into that tunnel.
[03:16:11.480 --> 03:16:14.180]   And sometimes it's observing other people in tunnels.
[03:16:14.180 --> 03:16:15.600]   And when you're not in the tunnel,
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:17.840]   it's so obvious what's happening.
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:19.760]   You're watching, in some cases, people just
[03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:21.300]   dragging their lives, in some cases,
[03:16:21.300 --> 03:16:22.500]   sinking their entire careers.
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:24.480]   I mean, the former chair of psychiatry
[03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:26.640]   at Columbia University in New York
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:32.080]   made an absolutely foolish, truly insensitive, totally
[03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:33.880]   inappropriate tweet.
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:34.880]   That's my opinion.
[03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:37.000]   And I think it was the opinion of all the people that
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:38.020]   fired him from his job.
[03:16:38.020 --> 03:16:40.680]   This person who was at the apex of his career
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:44.560]   lost his job for saying something terrible.
[03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:46.920]   And in retrospect, was like, said something like,
[03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:49.060]   I don't know what I was thinking, you know?
[03:16:49.060 --> 03:16:51.520]   And so this guy's a psychiatrist.
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:55.520]   So he lives in the study and the treatment of the mind, which
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:16:57.160]   just goes to show that everyone, I
[03:16:57.160 --> 03:17:00.440]   think, is susceptible to being pulled into these tunnels.
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:03.840]   And fortunately, everyone is susceptible to learning
[03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:06.720]   to teach themselves how to ratchet themselves out of it.
[03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:08.860]   So I love this idea of a teachable skill.
[03:17:08.860 --> 03:17:10.880]   I'm certainly going to practice it in one-on-one
[03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:14.920]   and in group situations and in a variety of situations.
[03:17:14.920 --> 03:17:19.200]   I think that the tunnel has a gravitational pull.
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:20.900]   There's an allure to that tunnel.
[03:17:20.900 --> 03:17:23.120]   And I always just go right back to the neurochemistry.
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:24.960]   I think that there's something about solving
[03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:28.440]   a problem inside of a tunnel, like an animal on a chase.
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:31.040]   But at some point, that animal could
[03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:33.480]   get picked off by a run over by a truck
[03:17:33.480 --> 03:17:36.080]   because it didn't have enough situational awareness.
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:40.320]   I'm definitely going to practice this through opening the gaze
[03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:41.760]   and broadening gaze.
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:43.840]   And I think I also do for a couple of days
[03:17:43.840 --> 03:17:47.080]   off from things to just walk and think about work.
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:49.880]   On these retreats, do people work on work?
[03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:51.560]   Or are they just there to do other things?
[03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:53.280]   And that's where the ideas surface.
[03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:54.920]   We'll do a little bit of both.
[03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:57.580]   So we'll do some stuff that is focused on work,
[03:17:57.580 --> 03:17:59.260]   but then we'll pull out and do things
[03:17:59.260 --> 03:18:03.400]   that are completely unrelated to work for that very reason.
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:05.560]   Whether we do something physical,
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:07.920]   whether we do some kind of a mental exercise,
[03:18:07.920 --> 03:18:09.360]   but we do things that are completely
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:14.020]   unrelated to their work and take those breaks in order for them
[03:18:14.020 --> 03:18:17.240]   to free their mind.
[03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:21.360]   You know what bothers you about social media?
[03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:24.940]   When you say there's some things that kind of make you mad?
[03:18:24.940 --> 03:18:26.440]   I mean, not me, but could be.
[03:18:26.440 --> 03:18:27.800]   No, of course, of course.
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:30.380]   Like I'm a human, you know, little things, little things.
[03:18:30.380 --> 03:18:31.580]   It's not the things that are obvious.
[03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:33.480]   It's actually not direct critique of me.
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:36.620]   It's when people exploit misunderstandings
[03:18:36.620 --> 03:18:39.580]   to try and create a greater misunderstanding that
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:40.400]   doesn't exist.
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:41.360]   That's what gets me.
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:44.160]   Because to a scientist, that's like the most irritating thing.
[03:18:44.160 --> 03:18:46.540]   I don't know what the analogy would be in the SEAL teams,
[03:18:46.540 --> 03:18:49.360]   but it's like someone like hijacking something that like,
[03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:51.400]   they didn't mean that, but then they kind of,
[03:18:51.400 --> 03:18:52.880]   they distort the argument.
[03:18:52.880 --> 03:18:55.200]   The word gaslighting gets thrown around a lot now.
[03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:56.840]   A lot of people actually think that anytime someone
[03:18:56.840 --> 03:18:58.840]   states a boundary, like, no, I don't believe that's that,
[03:18:58.840 --> 03:18:59.880]   that that's gaslighting.
[03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:01.960]   Trust me, the psychiatrists who are all professionally trained
[03:19:01.960 --> 03:19:03.420]   tell me that is not gaslighting.
[03:19:03.420 --> 03:19:05.840]   Gaslighting is a very particular thing where you're trying
[03:19:05.840 --> 03:19:08.560]   to alter someone's reality in a very active,
[03:19:08.560 --> 03:19:10.340]   almost like sociopathic way.
[03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:13.740]   So I just want, that's a little editorializing right there.
[03:19:13.740 --> 03:19:17.560]   What bothers me is when people hijack,
[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:21.340]   you know, sometimes someone in an argument
[03:19:21.340 --> 03:19:23.520]   is in a sophisticated with their language to somebody else.
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:25.840]   So someone will hijack that lack of sophistication
[03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:27.440]   and try and flip them on their back.
[03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:29.780]   That sort of thing really gets under my skin
[03:19:29.780 --> 03:19:33.040]   because I feel that creates unnecessary divide.
[03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:35.640]   There are a few other things, but you know,
[03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:37.660]   I always joke in my lab and I'll say, you know,
[03:19:37.660 --> 03:19:40.440]   I have 3000 pet peeves, but I also have like 3000 flaws
[03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:43.280]   to match each one of those pet peeves, so.
[03:19:43.280 --> 03:19:46.840]   - Yeah, whenever I'm, and this is not just social media,
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:50.640]   but it's just life, you know, when somebody says something
[03:19:50.640 --> 03:19:54.220]   about me or to me that I don't like.
[03:19:54.220 --> 03:19:55.880]   What I realized years ago is like,
[03:19:55.880 --> 03:19:57.760]   the reason I don't like it is 'cause there's some truth
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:19:58.800]   in what they're saying.
[03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:02.640]   And the best thing to do is to say either to yourself,
[03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:06.900]   if you're by yourself or to them, is to say, yeah, yeah,
[03:20:06.900 --> 03:20:10.440]   yeah, you're right, I am kind of a knucklehead sometimes.
[03:20:10.440 --> 03:20:14.540]   Or yeah, you're right, I sometimes do jump to conclusions.
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:15.900]   Or yeah, yeah, you're right,
[03:20:15.900 --> 03:20:18.360]   I was completely wrong about that.
[03:20:18.360 --> 03:20:23.360]   And that is just so much more liberating and healthy
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:27.720]   than saying, you don't know what you're talking about.
[03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:31.360]   Or no, I don't, just going into that defensive mode
[03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:33.880]   and trying to close your mind instead of opening your mind
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:36.160]   up to listen to what somebody else has to say and say,
[03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:39.720]   yeah, that's a good point, you're spot on with that one.
[03:20:39.720 --> 03:20:44.520]   Next question, next comment, let's go.
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:46.440]   - One thing I appreciate about you on social media
[03:20:46.440 --> 03:20:50.960]   is the limited number of words in each of your responses.
[03:20:50.960 --> 03:20:54.080]   It's a great thing and forcing you to be efficient
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:56.600]   and concise actually is a huge advantage.
[03:20:56.600 --> 03:20:59.440]   It also forces you to be precise,
[03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:01.480]   at least about category, right?
[03:21:01.480 --> 03:21:03.480]   I think there's something to be said for that.
[03:21:03.480 --> 03:21:05.320]   - Well, there's a good example.
[03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:07.880]   So I was on social, on Twitter the other day
[03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:12.880]   since Twitter's getting a lot of traction right now,
[03:21:12.880 --> 03:21:14.700]   there's a lot of mayhem going on in Twitter.
[03:21:14.700 --> 03:21:15.560]   - The other gunfight.
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:17.240]   - And somebody asked me, somebody said,
[03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:18.980]   hey, I'm going to bootcamp soon,
[03:21:18.980 --> 03:21:20.320]   what advice do you have for me?
[03:21:20.320 --> 03:21:22.320]   And I wrote back, enjoy, boom.
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:23.760]   And like you said, I mean, it's Twitter,
[03:21:23.760 --> 03:21:25.840]   I'm responding to a bunch of people.
[03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:28.680]   And then somebody else chimed in and said,
[03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:32.280]   might as well not even answer Jocko,
[03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:34.460]   that's not helping this guy at all.
[03:21:34.460 --> 03:21:37.440]   And look at your face, for those of you that are watching,
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:39.140]   your face just got a little bit mad, right?
[03:21:39.140 --> 03:21:41.040]   You got a little bit defensive for me.
[03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:43.040]   - Yeah, well, I think that's my nature.
[03:21:43.040 --> 03:21:45.560]   I don't like seeing other people sort of attacked.
[03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:46.540]   I think that's just my nature.
[03:21:46.540 --> 03:21:49.200]   - I had a split second of who the hell is this guy?
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:51.200]   And then I said, you know what, he's right.
[03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:53.840]   And then I tweeted again, back then I said,
[03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:55.520]   sorry, man, you're right.
[03:21:55.520 --> 03:21:56.920]   What I should have said was,
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:22:01.480]   hey, read the book Leadership Strategy and Tactics.
[03:22:01.480 --> 03:22:04.560]   It's a good book for someone that is going to be
[03:22:04.560 --> 03:22:06.840]   in an environment that's going to be challenging
[03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:09.360]   and we're going to be faced with leadership challenges
[03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:14.160]   and enjoy bootcamp because if your mindset is,
[03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:17.260]   this is sucks and this is terrible,
[03:22:17.260 --> 03:22:20.040]   it's going to be terrible and it's going to suck.
[03:22:20.040 --> 03:22:21.560]   And if you go with a mindset of,
[03:22:21.560 --> 03:22:25.520]   hey, this is a cool experience and I should enjoy it,
[03:22:25.520 --> 03:22:27.320]   you're going to have a much better time.
[03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:29.480]   That's my full answer, I'm sorry, I didn't give you.
[03:22:29.480 --> 03:22:30.920]   And it's perfectly fine.
[03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:33.660]   Like that guy was right to critique me.
[03:22:33.660 --> 03:22:35.600]   And he was right in saying that.
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:37.400]   And there was a bunch of, what's funny is a bunch of other
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:39.520]   people came to my defense and said, this guy,
[03:22:39.520 --> 03:22:40.360]   that's really great.
[03:22:40.360 --> 03:22:43.400]   And so, but my point is instead of me getting defensive
[03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:45.880]   and crazy and letting it drive me crazy,
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:47.240]   opened my mind a little bit,
[03:22:47.240 --> 03:22:48.840]   listen to what they have to say,
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:51.020]   accept that there's got to be some level of truth in it.
[03:22:51.020 --> 03:22:55.880]   And there was, I gave a guy a very, very terse response
[03:22:55.880 --> 03:22:57.760]   and I could have expanded on it more.
[03:22:57.760 --> 03:23:01.120]   And I did, no big deal, good times.
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:03.880]   - A few minutes ago, I was thinking to myself,
[03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:06.440]   I wonder where your mind is at like in the few moments
[03:23:06.440 --> 03:23:07.480]   before you fall asleep.
[03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:10.920]   Like, are you able to make yourself go mind blank
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:12.920]   pretty easily?
[03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:14.700]   It's something I've been practicing more
[03:23:14.700 --> 03:23:16.060]   because I tend to, again, ruminate.
[03:23:16.060 --> 03:23:17.760]   I like to drill into problems, obviously.
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:20.320]   Yesterday I did a solo episode, which when we do those,
[03:23:20.320 --> 03:23:24.200]   they're usually anywhere from five to 20 hours of prep.
[03:23:24.200 --> 03:23:26.520]   And then the recordings, I won't say how long they take,
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:29.320]   but I love going into the tunnel, right?
[03:23:29.320 --> 03:23:32.360]   The tunnel is like the, that's where the juice is for me.
[03:23:32.360 --> 03:23:35.040]   And finding the structure and I have the benefit
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:36.920]   of an amazing producer who helps me sort through it.
[03:23:36.920 --> 03:23:38.720]   And when I kind of like came out of this thing
[03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:41.400]   and then went home, couldn't eat.
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:42.700]   So I was just like, I don't want dinner.
[03:23:42.700 --> 03:23:44.560]   And then I was explaining a call I had
[03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:45.720]   with a colleague the other day.
[03:23:45.720 --> 03:23:49.000]   And, you know, my partner, she, my girlfriend,
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:50.880]   she was just like, you know, like, okay,
[03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:51.800]   like I'm going to sleep.
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:53.720]   And I was like up and like thinking of texting
[03:23:53.720 --> 03:23:54.960]   and like thinking of writing notes out.
[03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:56.920]   And I thought, oh man, like I'm like Costello,
[03:23:56.920 --> 03:23:59.360]   like chewing on the stick and like chewing into my paw.
[03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:00.200]   I need, I need sleep.
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:01.220]   I need to go to sleep.
[03:24:01.220 --> 03:24:04.800]   So I think I have a bit of a harder time disengaging
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:09.440]   clearly and this is why I never touched cocaine or amphetamine
[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:12.500]   because I think that some of us have a love
[03:24:12.500 --> 03:24:15.040]   of the dopamine circuitry that I always sensed
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:17.360]   if I were to have tried drugs like that,
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:22.080]   that they might've been the, the thing
[03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:25.020]   that would like hit my neural circuits just right.
[03:24:25.020 --> 03:24:26.440]   You know, some people talk about alcohol that way.
[03:24:26.440 --> 03:24:28.480]   I've read books by alcoholics, like the book "Dry"
[03:24:28.480 --> 03:24:31.340]   and a few other, Rich Roll talks about this,
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:33.120]   that he drank alcohol for the first time in college.
[03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:35.240]   And it was like this elixir that filled his body
[03:24:35.240 --> 03:24:37.760]   that made him feel right for the first time.
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:39.820]   Like that is not how I feel after a couple of drinks.
[03:24:39.820 --> 03:24:43.200]   I feel a little relaxed, but I can do without it.
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:47.620]   But this drilling into something is really, that's my,
[03:24:47.620 --> 03:24:50.140]   I guess maybe that's my, I don't think it's the superpower,
[03:24:50.140 --> 03:24:51.800]   but I have some, some strength there,
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:53.320]   but I think it's also the thing that cut,
[03:24:53.320 --> 03:24:54.760]   that can cut on the other side.
[03:24:54.760 --> 03:24:57.080]   - Yeah, when you started off this conversation early,
[03:24:57.080 --> 03:24:59.220]   you talked about, you know, getting up in the morning
[03:24:59.220 --> 03:25:00.480]   and do you just get up and you have these,
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:02.560]   and I was about to go down the path of like,
[03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:06.280]   it's at nighttime when I'm trying to go to sleep
[03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:09.160]   and I have some random thought about something
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:10.760]   that that can be a hard,
[03:25:10.760 --> 03:25:14.280]   I have a visual thing that's going on.
[03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:16.180]   It seems like I'm on a rollercoaster
[03:25:16.180 --> 03:25:18.400]   and I'm going in like a new idea comes
[03:25:18.400 --> 03:25:21.120]   and I'm just like on this awesome ride
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:22.860]   and it's not gonna stop and I can't,
[03:25:22.860 --> 03:25:24.320]   I don't know how to stop that.
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:28.720]   - Oh no, I mean, I think it goes with people
[03:25:28.720 --> 03:25:32.640]   who are very driven and like to master different crafts.
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:34.400]   I have a colleague, his name is Carl Deisseroth,
[03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:36.320]   he's a bioengineer, he has five children
[03:25:36.320 --> 03:25:38.680]   and he's a psychiatrist.
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:39.600]   He's like an incredible,
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:41.640]   like one of these people that does a ton,
[03:25:41.640 --> 03:25:43.440]   very likely will win the Nobel Prize.
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:45.300]   I mean, he's an amazing scientist, amazing guy,
[03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:47.160]   and he does this practice that he does,
[03:25:47.160 --> 03:25:48.080]   which is not a meditation,
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:50.640]   which is he sits for an hour late at night
[03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:52.200]   after his kids have gone to sleep
[03:25:52.200 --> 03:25:53.640]   and he forces himself,
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:56.140]   forces himself to think in complete sentences
[03:25:56.140 --> 03:25:58.900]   with punctuation about some problem.
[03:25:58.900 --> 03:26:02.940]   I tried doing that for about five minutes and I fell off.
[03:26:02.940 --> 03:26:05.060]   But it's something that he's cultivated in himself,
[03:26:05.060 --> 03:26:06.840]   which helps him in his career, right?
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:07.680]   I don't think this,
[03:26:07.680 --> 03:26:08.840]   there's certainly not something I recommend.
[03:26:08.840 --> 03:26:11.420]   If I did that at one or two in the morning,
[03:26:11.420 --> 03:26:13.240]   I think that would be bad for my sleep
[03:26:13.240 --> 03:26:14.720]   because falling asleep actually requires
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:16.740]   drifting into these kind of liminal states.
[03:26:16.740 --> 03:26:18.340]   It's one of the reasons why I'm a big proponent
[03:26:18.340 --> 03:26:20.560]   of things like non-sleep deep rest
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:22.020]   or these yoga nidra practices,
[03:26:22.020 --> 03:26:23.460]   which are basically body scans
[03:26:23.460 --> 03:26:25.680]   where you're trying to learn to detach
[03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:27.840]   from the sensory world.
[03:26:27.840 --> 03:26:29.620]   And they're very effective at,
[03:26:29.620 --> 03:26:31.120]   certainly for me they've been very effective
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:33.480]   at teaching me to kind of turn off thinking,
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:35.800]   which is an interesting notion in its own right.
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:37.960]   But I like the idea of detachment
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:40.000]   by stepping back and getting perspective.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:42.080]   My father is much better at that.
[03:26:42.080 --> 03:26:45.080]   He's a very calm guy in the world of confrontation.
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:46.400]   I always knew it when I was a kid
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:47.340]   'cause he would blink,
[03:26:47.340 --> 03:26:48.800]   which meant like something was gonna happen,
[03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:50.360]   like I was gonna get it.
[03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:52.680]   And now, but I've always noticed
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:56.720]   he can control his responses and his behavior.
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:26:58.520]   Others of us in the family,
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:26:59.520]   the side from New Jersey,
[03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:01.080]   we're more like go to loggerheads.
[03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:02.260]   So I don't know.
[03:27:02.260 --> 03:27:03.240]   This raises a question.
[03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:06.560]   And I think it's one that I and several other people
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:09.160]   I talked to in anticipation of this podcast were asking.
[03:27:09.160 --> 03:27:12.160]   I think one reason why people are drawn to people
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:14.280]   who have been in the SEAL teams
[03:27:14.280 --> 03:27:19.240]   and you in particular are that I think everybody,
[03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:21.580]   not just males, but females too,
[03:27:21.580 --> 03:27:24.380]   I think everybody wants to know
[03:27:24.380 --> 03:27:29.680]   their calibration point on their level of toughness.
[03:27:29.680 --> 03:27:30.680]   I think people wonder.
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:32.640]   You know, I think when people talk about Buds and all that,
[03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:33.600]   I think a lot of people wonder,
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:35.360]   would I make it through, right?
[03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:36.320]   I've certainly wondered it.
[03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:37.760]   I haven't spent hours on it.
[03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:38.600]   I went my path.
[03:27:38.600 --> 03:27:40.080]   I'm happy for the path I went.
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:42.660]   But I think people wonder,
[03:27:42.660 --> 03:27:46.360]   like, do I have this thing that supposedly Buds selects for?
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:50.120]   And if I don't, how tough am I or not tough am I?
[03:27:50.120 --> 03:27:54.280]   I think that we all can look at other people physically.
[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:55.860]   And I'm not somebody that does a lot of this.
[03:27:55.860 --> 03:27:57.480]   I know some people are really obsessed by this.
[03:27:57.480 --> 03:27:59.320]   Like, oh, that person has like an eight pack
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:00.580]   with like veins on there.
[03:28:00.580 --> 03:28:02.620]   Like, I don't understand that.
[03:28:02.620 --> 03:28:03.460]   That's not me.
[03:28:03.460 --> 03:28:04.820]   But I understand some people do that
[03:28:04.820 --> 03:28:06.900]   even to the point of pathology.
[03:28:06.900 --> 03:28:11.740]   But I think most people wonder like, how resilient am I?
[03:28:11.740 --> 03:28:14.020]   And they can look to experiences that they've survived
[03:28:14.020 --> 03:28:17.380]   and say, I made it through or I'm resilient or not.
[03:28:17.380 --> 03:28:20.420]   But is there a way that like we can,
[03:28:20.420 --> 03:28:22.940]   certainly that we can train it by doing hard things,
[03:28:22.940 --> 03:28:24.300]   cold showers, this kind of thing,
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:26.500]   or like small examples of those.
[03:28:26.500 --> 03:28:31.380]   But do you think it's even an important question to ask?
[03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:35.180]   And if it is, you know, how does one go about thinking?
[03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:37.940]   Like where, like how resilient am I?
[03:28:37.940 --> 03:28:41.100]   Should we put ourselves into situations of discomfort
[03:28:41.100 --> 03:28:42.260]   just to test that?
[03:28:42.260 --> 03:28:44.060]   Because I will say, I think a lot of people
[03:28:44.060 --> 03:28:47.500]   look to SEAL teams and team guys in particular
[03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:51.620]   as kind of a calibration point of like, okay,
[03:28:51.620 --> 03:28:52.740]   they know how to do hard things.
[03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:55.420]   They were selected for the ability to carry logs
[03:28:55.420 --> 03:28:57.980]   and get into cold water over and over and roll in the sand
[03:28:57.980 --> 03:29:00.580]   and go without sleep for a week or so.
[03:29:00.580 --> 03:29:02.180]   But that's probably not what they were doing
[03:29:02.180 --> 03:29:03.140]   when they were on deployment.
[03:29:03.140 --> 03:29:07.500]   It's clearly a pressure test for something else.
[03:29:07.500 --> 03:29:10.020]   - Yeah, it's a strange, strange thing,
[03:29:10.020 --> 03:29:12.860]   the basic underwater demolition SEAL training.
[03:29:12.860 --> 03:29:17.860]   And quite frankly, going and getting wet and cold
[03:29:17.860 --> 03:29:24.120]   and being miserable is actually nothing
[03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:31.640]   compared to like being on deployment.
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:34.620]   And a good example that I use to compare this to
[03:29:34.620 --> 03:29:39.500]   is when I was on deployment in 2006 in Ramadi,
[03:29:39.500 --> 03:29:44.500]   there was, as you were driving off base to go to the city,
[03:29:44.500 --> 03:29:49.600]   to go into the city and conduct operations,
[03:29:49.600 --> 03:29:53.860]   as you drove out of the compound, on your right
[03:29:53.860 --> 03:29:58.860]   was this area that was called the vehicle graveyard.
[03:29:58.860 --> 03:30:01.780]   And the vehicle graveyard was exactly what it sounds like.
[03:30:01.780 --> 03:30:06.780]   It was probably 75 or 100 vehicles that were blown up,
[03:30:08.740 --> 03:30:13.740]   destroyed, burned in various twisted conditions
[03:30:13.740 --> 03:30:18.040]   that had been dragged back through the city
[03:30:18.040 --> 03:30:19.620]   and put into this vehicle graveyard.
[03:30:19.620 --> 03:30:22.660]   And as you drove by that vehicle graveyard,
[03:30:22.660 --> 03:30:25.540]   you know without question that every one of those
[03:30:25.540 --> 03:30:32.200]   twisted vehicles represented one, two, three, four,
[03:30:32.200 --> 03:30:38.720]   five American casualties, wounded, horribly wounded,
[03:30:39.400 --> 03:30:44.400]   killed and there you are in a vehicle about to roll out
[03:30:44.400 --> 03:30:50.960]   into that city where what you're looking at
[03:30:50.960 --> 03:30:54.360]   can easily be you in the next three minutes.
[03:30:54.360 --> 03:30:56.480]   And you're gonna do that today.
[03:30:56.480 --> 03:30:57.720]   You're gonna do that tomorrow.
[03:30:57.720 --> 03:30:59.440]   You can do that the next day and the day after that
[03:30:59.440 --> 03:31:00.600]   and the day after that.
[03:31:00.600 --> 03:31:05.260]   That compared to, and by the way,
[03:31:05.260 --> 03:31:06.620]   this isn't just SEALs that are doing that.
[03:31:06.620 --> 03:31:09.360]   This is Marines, this is the army guys that are over there.
[03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:13.000]   This is what everyone is doing and they do it.
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:15.260]   They do it.
[03:31:15.260 --> 03:31:19.280]   I talk about Mark Lee, he was one of my guys,
[03:31:19.280 --> 03:31:24.280]   first SEAL killed in Iraq and he was the lead turret gunner
[03:31:24.280 --> 03:31:26.180]   in the lead Humvee.
[03:31:26.180 --> 03:31:32.000]   And like in Vietnam, if you were the point man in Vietnam,
[03:31:32.000 --> 03:31:33.780]   if you're on an infantry patrol,
[03:31:33.780 --> 03:31:35.900]   you were the point man in Vietnam, you were at risk.
[03:31:35.900 --> 03:31:39.520]   Booby traps, ambush, so they rotated you out.
[03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:41.820]   Like you didn't have to stay up there all the time.
[03:31:41.820 --> 03:31:43.920]   You do an hour up at the last point, man,
[03:31:43.920 --> 03:31:45.520]   they get someone else up there.
[03:31:45.520 --> 03:31:49.000]   And that guy, the lead turret gunner
[03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:54.880]   in a Humvee column of four or five or six vehicles,
[03:31:54.880 --> 03:31:56.600]   you hit an IED, that's the vehicle
[03:31:56.600 --> 03:31:58.540]   that's gonna hit it, right?
[03:31:58.540 --> 03:31:59.720]   If you go into an ambush,
[03:31:59.720 --> 03:32:00.560]   that's the guy that's gonna get hit.
[03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:05.120]   It's the guy that's standing up in a 50 caliber turret
[03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:07.700]   that's the guy that's gonna die.
[03:32:07.700 --> 03:32:13.220]   And Mark was, you know, he was a new guy,
[03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:16.700]   so he's in that lead turret, 50 cal
[03:32:16.700 --> 03:32:20.620]   and he never asked to get rotated out.
[03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:26.100]   And I remember, he's a very, like to say very,
[03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:30.180]   he was extremely charismatic, funny,
[03:32:30.180 --> 03:32:33.840]   gregarious comedian.
[03:32:35.100 --> 03:32:38.100]   And, you know, we got all kinds of stories about Mark,
[03:32:38.100 --> 03:32:39.680]   but one of them, you know, we were in Vegas
[03:32:39.680 --> 03:32:40.860]   and we're all gambling.
[03:32:40.860 --> 03:32:44.120]   And like, I come down from my hotel room
[03:32:44.120 --> 03:32:46.800]   and like, I see Mark across the,
[03:32:46.800 --> 03:32:48.440]   he's playing blackjack, you know, he sees me,
[03:32:48.440 --> 03:32:51.280]   he goes, "Hey, sir, when are the new Cadillacs coming out?"
[03:32:51.280 --> 03:32:54.380]   Like, he's just lighting up everybody,
[03:32:54.380 --> 03:32:56.160]   just having a fantastic time.
[03:32:56.160 --> 03:32:57.400]   But I remember one night, you know,
[03:32:57.400 --> 03:32:58.680]   he's getting ready to roll out.
[03:32:58.680 --> 03:33:01.680]   And if I wasn't going out with the platoons,
[03:33:01.680 --> 03:33:03.640]   I'd like go out, you know, like see the guys off,
[03:33:03.640 --> 03:33:05.120]   give them a hand salute as they're leaving.
[03:33:05.120 --> 03:33:08.600]   And I'm like, "How are you doing, Mark, you good to go?"
[03:33:08.600 --> 03:33:10.440]   And he's like, "Feeling lucky, sir."
[03:33:10.440 --> 03:33:13.100]   You know, like that was his attitude.
[03:33:13.100 --> 03:33:17.040]   And he's a guy that's gonna drive by that vehicle graveyard,
[03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:18.520]   drive right out on that city.
[03:33:18.520 --> 03:33:19.540]   And he's gonna do it the next day
[03:33:19.540 --> 03:33:21.080]   and the day after that and the day after that.
[03:33:21.080 --> 03:33:26.080]   So, and like I said, that's what the army guys are doing.
[03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:27.860]   That's what the Marine Corps guys are doing.
[03:33:27.860 --> 03:33:29.500]   They're doing it.
[03:33:29.500 --> 03:33:34.100]   And so as much as the mythology around basic SEAL training
[03:33:34.100 --> 03:33:39.100]   goes, to me, that's that experience in combat
[03:33:39.100 --> 03:33:46.740]   and what guys do is infinitely harder
[03:33:46.740 --> 03:33:48.240]   and infinitely more important.
[03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:53.700]   Now, all that being said, basic SEAL training
[03:33:53.700 --> 03:33:58.160]   is a very strange laboratory for human beings.
[03:33:58.160 --> 03:34:00.860]   It is a very strange laboratory for human beings.
[03:34:00.860 --> 03:34:01.700]   And it's a,
[03:34:01.700 --> 03:34:09.340]   it's kind of crazy the way it works.
[03:34:09.340 --> 03:34:12.100]   It's very, it's obviously extremely difficult,
[03:34:12.100 --> 03:34:14.740]   but there's no, like you, I wouldn't put money.
[03:34:14.740 --> 03:34:18.500]   You could put odds on somebody making it through.
[03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:19.860]   You know, like, hey, that guy seems like
[03:34:19.860 --> 03:34:20.760]   it's gonna be good to go,
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:22.940]   but I wouldn't put a bunch of money on it, right?
[03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:24.700]   And I wouldn't take like 100%.
[03:34:24.700 --> 03:34:27.320]   I would never take 100% bet on anybody.
[03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:28.940]   'Cause there's no one that's 100% gonna make it
[03:34:28.940 --> 03:34:30.140]   through that training.
[03:34:30.140 --> 03:34:33.860]   And there's just random, you know, some people say,
[03:34:33.860 --> 03:34:35.100]   it's well, it's 'cause of your wife.
[03:34:35.100 --> 03:34:36.420]   There's people that make it through SEAL training
[03:34:36.420 --> 03:34:39.260]   'cause their ex-girlfriend said they couldn't make it.
[03:34:39.260 --> 03:34:40.780]   There's some other guy that makes it through
[03:34:40.780 --> 03:34:44.100]   because they promised God that they would make it.
[03:34:44.100 --> 03:34:45.620]   There's some other guy that made it through
[03:34:45.620 --> 03:34:47.500]   because, you know, their dad said they could have it.
[03:34:47.500 --> 03:34:48.900]   There's like every one of these examples
[03:34:48.900 --> 03:34:49.740]   you can come up with.
[03:34:49.740 --> 03:34:52.380]   And it's good enough for some random dude
[03:34:52.380 --> 03:34:53.260]   to make it through.
[03:34:53.260 --> 03:34:55.360]   And it doesn't matter what your pedigree is,
[03:34:55.360 --> 03:34:56.660]   doesn't matter where you're from.
[03:34:56.660 --> 03:34:59.620]   There's guys from Iowa, there's guys from Florida,
[03:34:59.620 --> 03:35:03.720]   there's guys from wherever that make it.
[03:35:03.720 --> 03:35:05.460]   And there's guys from Iowa, and there's guys from Florida,
[03:35:05.460 --> 03:35:06.900]   and there's guys from wherever that don't make it.
[03:35:06.900 --> 03:35:10.380]   Guys from farms, guys from silver spoon in their mouth,
[03:35:10.380 --> 03:35:12.000]   and you just can't predict it.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:15.240]   And I mean, it has to have something to do with the fact
[03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:18.200]   that how bad you actually wanna do it.
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:23.060]   That's, it's a strange thing.
[03:35:23.060 --> 03:35:26.180]   And I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't try and,
[03:35:26.180 --> 03:35:28.400]   you know, if I was in the world,
[03:35:28.400 --> 03:35:30.080]   if I didn't do that training,
[03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:32.140]   I wouldn't be trying to figure out if I could make it or not
[03:35:32.140 --> 03:35:35.440]   'cause you don't know, you don't know.
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:39.280]   It's a very strange thing.
[03:35:39.280 --> 03:35:44.280]   And it's so mythical almost right now, right?
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:48.680]   It's mythical that how hard it is.
[03:35:48.680 --> 03:35:51.980]   And this is not too many people make it through, man.
[03:35:51.980 --> 03:35:53.020]   - 15%.
[03:35:53.020 --> 03:35:53.940]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[03:35:53.940 --> 03:35:56.060]   - Yeah, from all the folks that I've talked to
[03:35:56.060 --> 03:35:59.580]   who are there, gone through, been instructors there,
[03:35:59.580 --> 03:36:03.860]   some we both know, seem that that 15% number
[03:36:03.860 --> 03:36:06.740]   is unlikely to change as long as they keep
[03:36:06.740 --> 03:36:08.060]   the process the same.
[03:36:08.060 --> 03:36:10.420]   It just seems like about 15% of people
[03:36:10.420 --> 03:36:13.500]   seem to have something in them that can perhaps grow
[03:36:13.500 --> 03:36:17.180]   during that training, but that it is being identified
[03:36:17.180 --> 03:36:21.220]   and selected for rather than somehow being built up across
[03:36:21.220 --> 03:36:23.260]   at least that phase of the early phases of training.
[03:36:23.260 --> 03:36:26.300]   And then at some point they build on that capacity.
[03:36:26.300 --> 03:36:29.660]   And this gets to this really somewhat controversial issue,
[03:36:29.660 --> 03:36:32.420]   frankly, like are people wired differently?
[03:36:32.420 --> 03:36:36.620]   And listen, I started off in neural development
[03:36:36.620 --> 03:36:39.020]   and I'll tell you that there are some universal properties
[03:36:39.020 --> 03:36:41.860]   of neural development in all surviving humans
[03:36:41.860 --> 03:36:43.780]   like that you're going to breathe
[03:36:43.780 --> 03:36:44.780]   without having to think about it.
[03:36:44.780 --> 03:36:45.620]   Your heart's going to beat
[03:36:45.620 --> 03:36:46.440]   without having to think about it.
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:48.340]   But beyond that, there's a lot of variation
[03:36:48.340 --> 03:36:50.960]   in natural levels of dopamine and serotonin.
[03:36:52.840 --> 03:36:56.300]   There's nature, plays a powerful role and nurture.
[03:36:56.300 --> 03:36:57.200]   And what's interesting though,
[03:36:57.200 --> 03:37:00.520]   is we can't always predict from parents
[03:37:00.520 --> 03:37:01.500]   what nature is going to do.
[03:37:01.500 --> 03:37:02.880]   Recently, we had someone on the podcast.
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:04.980]   I'm excited for you to listen to it.
[03:37:04.980 --> 03:37:06.140]   Perhaps you will, if I send it to you,
[03:37:06.140 --> 03:37:10.640]   is a guy who talks about inheritable acquired traits.
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:12.320]   You don't expect that because you work out
[03:37:12.320 --> 03:37:14.300]   that your grandkids will be more muscular
[03:37:14.300 --> 03:37:16.160]   and have better endurance.
[03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:17.620]   But there's actually some evidence
[03:37:17.620 --> 03:37:19.340]   that that may be the case.
[03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:20.900]   And you go, well, how could that be?
[03:37:20.900 --> 03:37:22.340]   We've got two kinds of cells in your body.
[03:37:22.340 --> 03:37:23.920]   It turns out you have what are called somatic cells,
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:24.760]   which are all of them.
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:25.580]   Then you have the germ cells,
[03:37:25.580 --> 03:37:27.460]   which are your sperm and your wife's eggs.
[03:37:27.460 --> 03:37:31.620]   Well, why wouldn't the DNA of the sperm cells
[03:37:31.620 --> 03:37:34.240]   and the egg cells be modifiable by experience
[03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:35.440]   if all the other cells are?
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:36.780]   And it turns out there's some evidence
[03:37:36.780 --> 03:37:39.840]   that maybe it's not the DNA, but that the RNA are.
[03:37:39.840 --> 03:37:40.680]   Think about that.
[03:37:40.680 --> 03:37:42.020]   That means that whether, and we've known this,
[03:37:42.020 --> 03:37:43.420]   that people that have been in a famine
[03:37:43.420 --> 03:37:44.640]   several generations later,
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:47.200]   their implications for blood sugar regulation
[03:37:47.200 --> 03:37:49.020]   in their great grandkids.
[03:37:49.020 --> 03:37:52.040]   So the idea that experience and acquired traits
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:54.920]   can change us actually has some validity.
[03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:58.380]   And this gets into really complicated things.
[03:37:58.380 --> 03:37:59.740]   So people go, oh, this is like the giraffe
[03:37:59.740 --> 03:38:01.220]   that had to crane its neck
[03:38:01.220 --> 03:38:03.100]   and then gave birth to longer necked giraffes.
[03:38:03.100 --> 03:38:04.820]   And it's like, well, not exactly,
[03:38:04.820 --> 03:38:08.520]   but also not entirely untrue either.
[03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:11.840]   So I love the idea that there are inherited traits
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:14.600]   and that nature and nurture play a role,
[03:38:14.600 --> 03:38:19.140]   but that hard work may actually transmit across generations.
[03:38:19.140 --> 03:38:21.120]   - Yeah, in SEAL training,
[03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:23.800]   you have kids that come through that they call legacies,
[03:38:23.800 --> 03:38:25.680]   which means that they have a dad,
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:28.820]   I think a dad, brother, whatever,
[03:38:28.820 --> 03:38:32.760]   and they do have a better chance of making it,
[03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:35.620]   but it's not a guaranteed chance at all.
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:38.220]   And my personal opinion is like,
[03:38:38.220 --> 03:38:41.640]   I think a legacy kid would have a better chance of making it
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:44.560]   just due to the Thanksgiving dinner
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:45.800]   that you're gonna have to go through
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:48.000]   for the rest of your life with your family.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:48.820]   - If you don't.
[03:38:48.820 --> 03:38:50.200]   - Yeah, if you're even invited,
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:51.860]   which you might be on your own.
[03:38:51.860 --> 03:38:56.200]   But yeah, so maybe there's something to that as well.
[03:38:56.200 --> 03:38:59.600]   But I think that's just more the pressure
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:00.960]   that someone must feel like,
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:05.520]   hey, there's no way I'm gonna be allowed back in my home
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:07.340]   if I don't make it through this training.
[03:39:07.340 --> 03:39:10.360]   So I'm gonna have to just go ahead and suck it up.
[03:39:10.360 --> 03:39:11.880]   But not everyone makes it.
[03:39:11.880 --> 03:39:15.880]   And it's a bummer when that does occur.
[03:39:15.880 --> 03:39:17.640]   - Well, for people who are not thinking
[03:39:17.640 --> 03:39:18.840]   about going through SEAL training
[03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:19.940]   or who miss the opportunity
[03:39:19.940 --> 03:39:23.200]   or who are not interested in that for whatever reason,
[03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:26.520]   do you think there's value to doing things each day
[03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:28.440]   that suck a little bit?
[03:39:28.440 --> 03:39:30.360]   Or from time to time doing something
[03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:33.840]   that puts one into a state of deliberate discomfort?
[03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:35.300]   - 100%, yeah.
[03:39:35.300 --> 03:39:36.140]   I mean, 100%.
[03:39:36.140 --> 03:39:39.080]   I mean, even in order to improve yourself,
[03:39:39.080 --> 03:39:42.920]   you gotta impose some discipline on yourself, right?
[03:39:42.920 --> 03:39:44.320]   If you wanna get stronger,
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:46.760]   you've gotta do things that require strength.
[03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:48.040]   If you wanna be tougher,
[03:39:48.040 --> 03:39:50.220]   you gotta do things that require you to be tougher.
[03:39:50.220 --> 03:39:51.900]   I think that's pretty straightforward.
[03:39:51.900 --> 03:39:53.920]   - Does that mean doing things that are not pleasurable?
[03:39:53.920 --> 03:39:54.760]   So for instance,
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:57.940]   you and I have done some long podcasts.
[03:39:57.940 --> 03:40:00.480]   And a few weeks ago, I did a series.
[03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:02.400]   We were doing a series with Andy Galpin,
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:04.120]   all about exercise and exercise science.
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:05.600]   And we did six podcasts in that week,
[03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:06.780]   the most I've ever done,
[03:40:06.780 --> 03:40:09.880]   which made doing four or five the next week not so bad.
[03:40:09.880 --> 03:40:11.900]   But I loved every second of it.
[03:40:11.900 --> 03:40:14.040]   And I love every second of podcasting.
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:17.800]   And so it didn't suck, but it built up a greater capacity.
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:19.600]   I guess I'm asking specifically about things
[03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:21.800]   that really feel like a splinter.
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:23.720]   Is there any value to that?
[03:40:23.720 --> 03:40:26.020]   Because I have to say, there are some people I know,
[03:40:26.020 --> 03:40:28.640]   some of them are former team, are team guys.
[03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:29.920]   I guess you don't say former team guys.
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:32.240]   They were out, they're out of the teams now,
[03:40:32.240 --> 03:40:33.520]   but they're team guys forever,
[03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:37.020]   who seem to not be rattled by little things.
[03:40:37.020 --> 03:40:38.120]   Those guys in particular,
[03:40:38.120 --> 03:40:40.040]   they don't seem to be rattled by little things.
[03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:42.440]   And then I know people that, you know,
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:45.660]   they get the wrong size coffee at a coffee shop
[03:40:45.660 --> 03:40:48.360]   and they dissolve into a puddle of tears, right?
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:49.940]   So there does seem to be something
[03:40:49.940 --> 03:40:51.920]   to this whole like mental resilience thing
[03:40:51.920 --> 03:40:53.180]   and flexibility thing.
[03:40:53.180 --> 03:40:58.220]   And I try and do something that's uncomfortable
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:41:01.520]   to me about once a week, something I really don't like.
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:05.420]   It doesn't matter what that is,
[03:41:05.420 --> 03:41:08.920]   but I try and do something that's kind of like unpleasant.
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:10.460]   Or do something in a way that's unpleasant.
[03:41:10.460 --> 03:41:13.080]   I guess the example would be getting into the cold water
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:14.420]   the first thing in the morning
[03:41:14.420 --> 03:41:17.740]   and making that decision from under the blankets
[03:41:17.740 --> 03:41:19.920]   is a rough one for me.
[03:41:19.920 --> 03:41:20.920]   But then it gets easier.
[03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:23.040]   And then you wonder, is it still serving the purpose
[03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:24.640]   that it's building me up?
[03:41:24.640 --> 03:41:28.300]   So should people seek truly like bad experiences
[03:41:28.300 --> 03:41:30.540]   provided that they're done in a safe way?
[03:41:30.540 --> 03:41:31.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:41:31.560 --> 03:41:35.600]   I think that you're gonna,
[03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:39.640]   just like you would develop your legs by doing squats
[03:41:39.640 --> 03:41:42.280]   and you would develop your back by doing pull-ups.
[03:41:42.280 --> 03:41:44.560]   I think you would develop your resiliency
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:47.120]   by doing repetitions of things
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:49.920]   that require you to be tougher.
[03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:51.280]   - That actually sucks.
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:52.360]   Okay, good.
[03:41:52.360 --> 03:41:54.180]   And the reason I ask this is because I think
[03:41:54.180 --> 03:41:55.880]   a lot of people think, well, I work out every day,
[03:41:55.880 --> 03:41:58.360]   but then you probe them a little bit and they're like,
[03:41:58.360 --> 03:41:59.900]   but I love exercise.
[03:41:59.900 --> 03:42:01.660]   And then, well, then that doesn't quite qualify
[03:42:01.660 --> 03:42:03.420]   as something that makes you tougher, right?
[03:42:03.420 --> 03:42:06.240]   Or they think, oh, the last reps of a set are really tough.
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:08.360]   But if you love hitting failure on a set,
[03:42:08.360 --> 03:42:09.840]   'cause that's kind of what I seek in the gym,
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:11.800]   I love that aspect of the training.
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:13.160]   That's actually where I know I'm getting better.
[03:42:13.160 --> 03:42:15.060]   It no longer serves as resilience training.
[03:42:15.060 --> 03:42:16.780]   It more just serves as training.
[03:42:16.780 --> 03:42:19.600]   In any case, I think that the point is clear
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:21.680]   and I appreciate your answer.
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:23.880]   I have to ask about something.
[03:42:23.880 --> 03:42:26.880]   This is gonna seem like a total divergence, but it's not,
[03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:29.520]   which is animals.
[03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:31.760]   Because first of all, they're a love of mine
[03:42:31.760 --> 03:42:33.540]   in terms of understanding the animal kingdom
[03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:35.520]   and placing humans into the animal kingdom.
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:37.360]   Second of all, I know you're a hunter.
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:41.160]   And also I know you own dogs.
[03:42:41.160 --> 03:42:44.540]   And the question I have is, do you ever look at people
[03:42:44.540 --> 03:42:47.680]   or did you ever work in teams of guys
[03:42:47.680 --> 03:42:50.360]   when you were on active duty?
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:51.760]   Kind of see that the differences,
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:52.600]   you know, you mentioned before,
[03:42:52.600 --> 03:42:54.120]   this person's really good at problem solving.
[03:42:54.120 --> 03:42:57.940]   This person's a little bit more creative.
[03:42:57.940 --> 03:42:58.920]   Do you ever wonder whether or not
[03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:02.660]   people kind of embody different kind of animal archetypes?
[03:43:02.660 --> 03:43:04.720]   'Cause I do.
[03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:08.640]   - Well, that thing where people say that dogs or owners
[03:43:08.640 --> 03:43:10.240]   look like their dogs, dogs look like their owners.
[03:43:10.240 --> 03:43:13.040]   I think that's, I've seen all kinds of examples.
[03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:14.840]   You can go on the internet and find a bunch of examples
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:16.880]   of dogs that look like their owners
[03:43:16.880 --> 03:43:18.720]   and owners that look like their dogs.
[03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:19.900]   So I think that's true.
[03:43:19.900 --> 03:43:23.720]   And I think, you know, my dog's awesome.
[03:43:23.720 --> 03:43:26.280]   - Tell me about your dog, which kind of dog is it?
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:27.920]   - My dog is a German Shepherd.
[03:43:27.920 --> 03:43:31.520]   His name is Odin and he's an awesome dog.
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:34.940]   You know, like, and he's got a personality,
[03:43:34.940 --> 03:43:37.040]   but he's got an interesting personality.
[03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:42.040]   So like, he doesn't like to like cuddle, right?
[03:43:42.040 --> 03:43:48.240]   Like my kids will be like, oh, he doesn't like to cuddle.
[03:43:48.240 --> 03:43:51.480]   No, even, you know, when we go to bed at night,
[03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:53.620]   he goes to, you know, four feet away
[03:43:53.620 --> 03:43:54.820]   from the foot of my bed.
[03:43:54.820 --> 03:43:57.000]   Even if I was like, hey, jump up here.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:43:58.380]   I've told him, jump up in here.
[03:43:58.380 --> 03:43:59.980]   You know, we want to pet you.
[03:43:59.980 --> 03:44:01.840]   He'll jump up in there and he just like,
[03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:04.640]   kind of goes in that low crouch position
[03:44:04.640 --> 03:44:07.760]   and then sort of waits until I say free dog.
[03:44:07.760 --> 03:44:09.640]   And then he goes back down and he goes four feet away
[03:44:09.640 --> 03:44:11.640]   from the foot of the bed and sits there.
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:16.640]   'Cause he's, that's his personality is to protect
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:19.280]   and set security and do his job.
[03:44:19.280 --> 03:44:20.880]   And that's what he's like.
[03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:24.480]   And so, you know, you've got other dogs that are,
[03:44:24.480 --> 03:44:27.040]   you know, they're not gonna,
[03:44:27.040 --> 03:44:29.080]   they're at a totally different mindset.
[03:44:29.080 --> 03:44:31.560]   So yeah, dogs have definite personalities.
[03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:36.120]   - And look, I also have, it's not all genetic.
[03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:41.120]   So two of my friends got dogs that were brothers.
[03:44:41.120 --> 03:44:43.480]   What are they called?
[03:44:43.480 --> 03:44:45.440]   Dogo Argentinos, do you know what that is?
[03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:46.440]   - Oh, the Dogos.
[03:44:46.440 --> 03:44:48.120]   Yeah, those are hard to get in the US.
[03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:50.780]   They're not, they might not even be legal
[03:44:50.780 --> 03:44:51.780]   in the United States.
[03:44:51.780 --> 03:44:53.000]   So don't tell me who these people are.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:53.840]   Not that I care, but I'm not gonna report them.
[03:44:53.840 --> 03:44:57.760]   - I won't tell you who they are, but these two guys,
[03:44:57.760 --> 03:45:00.040]   and those two guys had different personalities.
[03:45:00.040 --> 03:45:04.280]   One guy is a very happy-go-lucky, likes to smoke pot,
[03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:09.280]   likes to hang out, very, just a chill kind of playful guy.
[03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:13.040]   The other guy's not, he's the opposite in every category.
[03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:16.820]   So, and they both got these dogs.
[03:45:16.820 --> 03:45:20.680]   And you fast forward, fast forward like a year,
[03:45:20.680 --> 03:45:24.280]   the dog that was owned by the playful guy,
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:27.960]   his dog was just a big puppy licking at, you know,
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:29.640]   just wagging the tail.
[03:45:29.640 --> 03:45:32.640]   The other dog, you had to keep it in a cage
[03:45:32.640 --> 03:45:34.960]   or it would murder everything in sight.
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:37.760]   And these dogs were brothers from the same litter
[03:45:37.760 --> 03:45:39.760]   and they were completely opposite.
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:44.720]   And so I think it has a lot more to do with,
[03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:48.080]   with nurture than it does to do with nature.
[03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:52.000]   But that being said, you know, when you look at,
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:54.940]   when you look at mouths, I mean, mouths have a personality
[03:45:54.940 --> 03:45:57.880]   that is very distinct compared to a German Shepherd.
[03:45:57.880 --> 03:45:59.720]   Now, look, there's outlying mouths,
[03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:01.280]   there's outlying German Shepherds,
[03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:03.440]   there's outlying, you know, you name,
[03:46:03.440 --> 03:46:05.080]   whatever kind of golden retriever
[03:46:05.080 --> 03:46:09.240]   or whatever dog is known for being more playful.
[03:46:09.240 --> 03:46:13.920]   Like you get around a mouth, mouths are mouths.
[03:46:13.920 --> 03:46:14.760]   And they're that way.
[03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:16.640]   Have you been around mouths before?
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:19.120]   - Oh, yeah, a few of them.
[03:46:19.120 --> 03:46:20.440]   My neighbor has one.
[03:46:20.440 --> 03:46:23.760]   And that thing is not terribly friendly,
[03:46:23.760 --> 03:46:27.080]   but it's a security dog, so I don't expect it to be.
[03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:31.040]   - Yeah, I know that they use them for work in the teams.
[03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:33.120]   And I've heard that you have to keep a close eye
[03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:34.240]   on your relationship with them
[03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:37.060]   'cause if you get lax about it, they'll bite you.
[03:46:37.060 --> 03:46:37.900]   Is that true?
[03:46:37.900 --> 03:46:39.560]   - The first time I saw one,
[03:46:39.560 --> 03:46:44.520]   we were doing like a drill with using dogs
[03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:45.340]   for the first time.
[03:46:45.340 --> 03:46:47.820]   And then one of the team guide dog handlers came out.
[03:46:47.820 --> 03:46:50.440]   And so we hit this target building and, you know,
[03:46:50.440 --> 03:46:51.680]   they kind of pre-briefed us like,
[03:46:51.680 --> 03:46:53.000]   "Hey, you get this target building
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:55.800]   and this guy's going to be a runner or squirter."
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:00.320]   And so we pull up in the Humvees, assault team jumps out.
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:01.500]   I'm kind of staying external.
[03:47:01.500 --> 03:47:03.540]   I kind of want to see what's going to happen.
[03:47:03.540 --> 03:47:06.160]   So the squirter goes running off
[03:47:06.160 --> 03:47:10.320]   and the dog handler, like, whatever,
[03:47:10.320 --> 03:47:15.320]   tracks his dog on this guy and then releases.
[03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:17.800]   It gives him whatever commands, you know,
[03:47:17.800 --> 03:47:19.000]   whatever the commands are.
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:21.680]   That thing is like totally primed.
[03:47:21.680 --> 03:47:24.060]   Like unlike anything you've ever seen in your life,
[03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:26.600]   it is just primed, it's tracking that guy.
[03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:28.620]   He hits that release on that leash
[03:47:28.620 --> 03:47:32.120]   and that thing takes off at a thousand miles an hour.
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:36.040]   It jumps like, I'm not kidding, 15 feet,
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:38.720]   maybe 10 feet in the air away
[03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:41.520]   and just chomps onto this dude.
[03:47:41.520 --> 03:47:42.440]   The dude goes down.
[03:47:42.440 --> 03:47:45.440]   It was freaking awesome.
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:47.840]   - I've seen some videos of those Malinois.
[03:47:47.840 --> 03:47:49.360]   I guess I didn't, forgive me,
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:50.520]   'cause before I didn't know what you're referring to,
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:52.320]   but Mal's, Belgian Malinois,
[03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:54.080]   those dogs like running up trees,
[03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:56.920]   jumping over little rivers.
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:47:59.700]   Yeah, it's crazy, incredibly powerful animals.
[03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:02.480]   Yeah, well, the idea that they mimic their owners
[03:48:02.480 --> 03:48:04.080]   has me a little concerned 'cause my last dog,
[03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:05.620]   I had to put him down, was my Bulldog Costell.
[03:48:05.620 --> 03:48:07.520]   He's a Bulldog Mastiff.
[03:48:07.520 --> 03:48:12.200]   I got him because I went to pick out a puppy, basically,
[03:48:12.200 --> 03:48:13.560]   and there were eight of these Bulldogs
[03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:14.680]   and all of them were running around
[03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:15.680]   and then there's one in the background
[03:48:15.680 --> 03:48:17.380]   just eating out of all of their bowls.
[03:48:17.380 --> 03:48:19.320]   And I was like, I want that one, you know?
[03:48:19.320 --> 03:48:21.080]   Big Bulldog, biggest one in the litter,
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:24.360]   laziest creature, not just dog,
[03:48:24.360 --> 03:48:26.080]   but laziest creature that ever existed.
[03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:28.460]   But if he needed to activate, he would.
[03:48:28.460 --> 03:48:30.480]   He was just very efficient with his energy.
[03:48:30.480 --> 03:48:33.040]   And I don't think I have a Bulldog personality
[03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:35.640]   and that's why I got him, to kind of balance me out.
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:39.040]   Never retrieved, never did anything,
[03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:42.440]   stole and destroyed every toy at every dog park in San Diego
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:43.920]   who's kind of famous there.
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:46.320]   I had to bring $5 bills to pay people
[03:48:46.320 --> 03:48:48.120]   for all the balls and things he would destroy.
[03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:50.440]   So anyway, my apologies to all the dog owners,
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:52.520]   not really, I miss them.
[03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:54.640]   Did you train your dog or did someone else announce?
[03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:55.480]   - I did.
[03:48:55.480 --> 03:48:56.560]   - And was he trained to be a security dog
[03:48:56.560 --> 03:48:59.160]   or a kind of family dog or kind of a mixture?
[03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:00.200]   - Yep, yep.
[03:49:00.200 --> 03:49:03.040]   I mean, the true working dogs,
[03:49:03.040 --> 03:49:07.200]   unless you have the time and effort to put into them
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:08.440]   or you buy them that way,
[03:49:08.440 --> 03:49:12.600]   you don't, like you don't want one of those dogs
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:14.420]   that I was just describing in your house.
[03:49:14.420 --> 03:49:16.100]   They're not for a house.
[03:49:16.100 --> 03:49:18.480]   Unless there's like, there's that level,
[03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:21.760]   my dog's not that level, he's awesome.
[03:49:21.760 --> 03:49:24.640]   - Did you apply some of the same principles
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:28.320]   that you use in leadership of humans with your dog?
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:30.780]   - Yep, there are a lot of similar principles,
[03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:33.280]   but there's also, you know, there's some differences.
[03:49:33.280 --> 03:49:36.920]   There's like, they're pack animals, right?
[03:49:36.920 --> 03:49:41.120]   And they respond to, you know, the pack leader.
[03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:45.640]   It is funny, you know, my dog obeys me
[03:49:45.640 --> 03:49:47.400]   as if it's the command of God.
[03:49:47.400 --> 03:49:51.320]   And my wife, he's kind of like, maybe I'll do what you say.
[03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:53.920]   So they pick up on that kind of stuff.
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:55.100]   - Dogs are very intuitive.
[03:49:55.100 --> 03:49:57.280]   I love this idea that I was told early on
[03:49:57.280 --> 03:49:58.720]   that they can feel your emotions.
[03:49:58.720 --> 03:50:01.720]   I think they actually can sense how we feel,
[03:50:01.720 --> 03:50:04.120]   not just by the intonation of our voice,
[03:50:04.120 --> 03:50:07.280]   but I hope someday someone will figure out
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:08.240]   in a non-invasive way,
[03:50:08.240 --> 03:50:10.000]   'cause I don't like the idea of people doing experiments
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:11.640]   on dogs in an invasive way,
[03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:13.040]   kind of like what they're picking up on.
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:15.280]   Like for instance, we know that sharks are paying attention
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:18.340]   to the amount of activity in the lateral line of fish.
[03:50:18.340 --> 03:50:20.840]   Fish have these stretches of neurons
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:21.820]   that they call the lateral line
[03:50:21.820 --> 03:50:23.640]   that allows them to school and know the distance
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:25.520]   to different things and be able to steer around coral.
[03:50:25.520 --> 03:50:27.280]   They feel proximity.
[03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:28.400]   It'd be kind of like if you're turning your corner,
[03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:30.840]   you go, and they can even recognize
[03:50:30.840 --> 03:50:33.400]   specific lateral line signatures.
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:34.640]   So it'd be like you and Mark Lee
[03:50:34.640 --> 03:50:36.020]   walking together through the dark,
[03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:37.480]   but maybe people sift around, but you're like,
[03:50:37.480 --> 03:50:38.980]   you don't have to look at them, that's Mark.
[03:50:38.980 --> 03:50:41.480]   You kind of learn him intuitively, like a fish can do that.
[03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:44.640]   Sharks can sense whether or not the lateral line
[03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:48.400]   is, I would say, vibrating but firing
[03:50:48.400 --> 03:50:50.680]   at a particular frequency to know,
[03:50:50.680 --> 03:50:53.320]   oh, that fish is like a little bit slower than the rest.
[03:50:53.320 --> 03:50:55.880]   I mean, hunting animals,
[03:50:55.880 --> 03:50:57.980]   just they develop these incredible senses.
[03:50:57.980 --> 03:51:02.360]   And I think humans have some of these kind of senses
[03:51:02.360 --> 03:51:03.320]   in a more rudimentary way.
[03:51:03.320 --> 03:51:05.800]   We're just not forced to use them unless, of course,
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:09.240]   you become a hunter of animals or a hunter of humans,
[03:51:09.240 --> 03:51:11.080]   and you tap into these neural circuits
[03:51:11.080 --> 03:51:13.820]   that are very primitive and hardwired in everybody,
[03:51:13.820 --> 03:51:16.560]   but of course they're honed in warriors.
[03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:20.280]   Where I could spiral off into animal biology
[03:51:20.280 --> 03:51:22.800]   in ways that truly would take us 26 hours.
[03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:24.080]   I don't want to do that.
[03:51:24.080 --> 03:51:27.340]   I'm almost hesitant to ask this question,
[03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:30.660]   but I'm going to do it anyway.
[03:51:30.660 --> 03:51:35.080]   Many times online, you are asked whether or not
[03:51:35.080 --> 03:51:37.400]   you will run for office.
[03:51:37.400 --> 03:51:41.880]   And I want to say that I think it's a true compliment.
[03:51:41.880 --> 03:51:43.840]   I don't think people are asking just to kind
[03:51:43.840 --> 03:51:44.820]   of entertain themselves.
[03:51:44.820 --> 03:51:47.520]   I think that this country certainly,
[03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:50.060]   and a lot of the world is desperate
[03:51:50.060 --> 03:51:52.860]   for certain kinds of leaders and people to have experience
[03:51:52.860 --> 03:51:55.840]   in high risk, high consequence, chaotic situations,
[03:51:55.840 --> 03:51:59.720]   and have shown prowess at leadership in multiple domains.
[03:51:59.720 --> 03:52:02.460]   And you are certainly one of those individuals.
[03:52:02.460 --> 03:52:06.800]   And so they ask for that reason among others.
[03:52:06.800 --> 03:52:09.080]   And I've heard you give your answer.
[03:52:09.080 --> 03:52:10.840]   You can repeat it again here,
[03:52:10.840 --> 03:52:14.920]   but as a more broad theme that I think people
[03:52:14.920 --> 03:52:19.920]   are interested in, do you think it's an important criteria
[03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:23.720]   or it would be great to see people in positions
[03:52:23.720 --> 03:52:27.360]   of leadership who've had wartime experience?
[03:52:27.360 --> 03:52:30.080]   And do you think that some of the shifts that we've seen
[03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:33.440]   in terms of patterns of leadership over the last,
[03:52:33.440 --> 03:52:35.960]   let's just make it real broad so that this isn't a relate
[03:52:35.960 --> 03:52:38.920]   to any particular person or stretch of history,
[03:52:38.920 --> 03:52:41.880]   but over the last, let's just say 25 years,
[03:52:41.880 --> 03:52:44.460]   reflect the fact that we haven't seen a lot of that,
[03:52:44.460 --> 03:52:47.380]   at least at the top tiers of leadership.
[03:52:47.380 --> 03:52:50.420]   - Yeah, I think it'd be excellent if people,
[03:52:50.420 --> 03:52:54.040]   if the president had military experience, for sure.
[03:52:54.040 --> 03:52:56.680]   I think that then they understand
[03:52:56.680 --> 03:52:59.060]   with the way the military works better.
[03:52:59.060 --> 03:53:01.480]   They understand that each civilians
[03:53:01.480 --> 03:53:02.480]   that control the military,
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:04.640]   'cause a lot of times people that are civilians
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:07.940]   don't understand that the civilians control the military.
[03:53:07.940 --> 03:53:11.120]   And I think that you do get to appreciate
[03:53:11.120 --> 03:53:17.000]   what war actually is and what the costs are.
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:21.920]   I think that, you know, I've seen in the same vein
[03:53:21.920 --> 03:53:25.500]   of people asking me to run for political office,
[03:53:25.500 --> 03:53:27.680]   I've heard, you know, seen comments saying,
[03:53:27.680 --> 03:53:31.760]   oh, that's what we need, a warmonger in office.
[03:53:31.760 --> 03:53:33.880]   And I've responded to a few of those.
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:36.520]   I think if there's any group of people
[03:53:36.520 --> 03:53:39.680]   that don't want war, it's people that have seen it,
[03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:43.360]   people that understand what the sacrifices are.
[03:53:43.360 --> 03:53:47.820]   And I think that being in the military,
[03:53:47.820 --> 03:53:50.120]   people understand that better.
[03:53:50.120 --> 03:53:52.520]   So yeah, I think it'd be a great qualification.
[03:53:52.520 --> 03:53:53.860]   I don't think it's mandatory.
[03:53:53.860 --> 03:53:54.780]   I mean, clearly it's not.
[03:53:54.780 --> 03:53:55.780]   We've had a bunch of presidents
[03:53:55.780 --> 03:53:58.740]   that haven't ever served anything.
[03:53:58.740 --> 03:53:59.840]   Really, we've had a bunch of presidents
[03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:02.520]   that have never served anything but themselves.
[03:54:02.520 --> 03:54:05.760]   So yeah, hopefully we'll get some more people
[03:54:05.760 --> 03:54:08.520]   that have some experience in the military,
[03:54:08.520 --> 03:54:11.880]   some combat experience would be especially nice,
[03:54:11.880 --> 03:54:14.000]   and that would be good in my opinion.
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:17.760]   - Well, I'm certainly not one to tell people what to do,
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:19.440]   and I'm certainly not gonna tell you what to do,
[03:54:19.440 --> 03:54:21.040]   but should you ever choose to run,
[03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:24.520]   I would certainly be very enthusiastic about that.
[03:54:24.520 --> 03:54:29.520]   And I will just say that with that stated,
[03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:31.220]   I hope people do hear what you just said.
[03:54:31.220 --> 03:54:32.940]   I share that sentiment.
[03:54:32.940 --> 03:54:35.560]   People who have led others besides themselves,
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:37.560]   I think is the key statement there.
[03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:41.400]   - Yeah, and look, I have friends that are politicians,
[03:54:41.400 --> 03:54:44.120]   and I really appreciate what they're doing,
[03:54:44.120 --> 03:54:46.560]   and it looks miserable to me.
[03:54:46.560 --> 03:54:50.040]   I don't like what I, good for them.
[03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:51.240]   I'm happy that they're in there
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:52.640]   trying to make a difference.
[03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:57.320]   And I guess this is me being selfish of me saying,
[03:54:57.320 --> 03:54:59.600]   look, I don't think I could stomach that.
[03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:04.600]   And I also think that right now I'm trying to help out,
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:07.600]   like for instance, we have, obviously,
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:09.440]   you've got the leadership consulting at Echelon Front.
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:10.920]   We're trying to help businesses grow.
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:12.840]   I've got Origin USA.
[03:55:12.840 --> 03:55:15.000]   We're bringing manufacturing back to America.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:18.320]   We've got 100 and 400 and 450 employees right now
[03:55:18.320 --> 03:55:23.120]   that are here in America working and growing that business.
[03:55:23.120 --> 03:55:24.240]   Obviously, the supplements,
[03:55:24.240 --> 03:55:27.780]   so everything that I'm doing here right now
[03:55:27.780 --> 03:55:32.040]   is to try and move the needle
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:35.200]   with America bringing manufacturing back,
[03:55:35.200 --> 03:55:37.280]   helping the economy as much as I can right now.
[03:55:37.280 --> 03:55:39.880]   So that's kind of what I'm doing right now.
[03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:43.140]   And my standard answer, which you alluded to,
[03:55:43.140 --> 03:55:44.960]   is if things got bad enough,
[03:55:44.960 --> 03:55:49.600]   then I would do what I had to do.
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:54.520]   But I don't think people appreciate my level of bad.
[03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:56.800]   I'm talking real bad.
[03:55:56.800 --> 03:55:58.280]   So it's not there yet,
[03:55:58.280 --> 03:56:00.000]   and hopefully it never will get there.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:03.280]   I'd rather surf and hang out with my friends
[03:56:03.280 --> 03:56:06.800]   and hang out with my family than do that.
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:11.800]   And hopefully America can find some level of balance.
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:15.280]   I think that's the problem that we're having right now.
[03:56:15.280 --> 03:56:17.960]   And a lot of these things that you talked about,
[03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:19.760]   specifically the thing you talk about with social media
[03:56:19.760 --> 03:56:22.560]   is not very good for political balance.
[03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:25.700]   It's actually horrible for political balance,
[03:56:25.700 --> 03:56:27.900]   and a lot of it has to do with just the way
[03:56:27.900 --> 03:56:29.220]   that those conversations are had.
[03:56:29.220 --> 03:56:30.840]   A lot of it has to do with ego as well,
[03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:33.940]   because I don't ever want to admit
[03:56:33.940 --> 03:56:35.940]   that I'm wrong about anything.
[03:56:35.940 --> 03:56:38.260]   And if I can find something
[03:56:38.260 --> 03:56:40.280]   that I think you might be wrong about,
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:42.360]   it's so satisfying to my ego
[03:56:42.360 --> 03:56:45.100]   to just call you out on that thing and attack you.
[03:56:45.100 --> 03:56:47.420]   And I think that's what a lot of people are doing right now.
[03:56:47.420 --> 03:56:48.660]   Now, that being said, also,
[03:56:48.660 --> 03:56:51.380]   I also usually say this as well.
[03:56:51.380 --> 03:56:52.720]   I travel around the country all the time.
[03:56:52.720 --> 03:56:54.900]   I work with companies of all sizes,
[03:56:54.900 --> 03:56:56.800]   work with people in every different industry,
[03:56:56.800 --> 03:57:00.600]   and they're not sitting around arguing with each other
[03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:04.000]   about the political scenery.
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:05.720]   They're talking about, hey, how can we grow our business?
[03:57:05.720 --> 03:57:06.860]   How can we take care of our workers?
[03:57:06.860 --> 03:57:07.960]   How can we take care of our clients?
[03:57:07.960 --> 03:57:09.360]   How can we take care of our customer?
[03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:10.920]   That's what people are focused on.
[03:57:10.920 --> 03:57:13.420]   And when you jump on social media,
[03:57:13.420 --> 03:57:18.400]   you can get sucked into the political scene very easily.
[03:57:18.400 --> 03:57:22.400]   And that being said, also, we do have to pay attention,
[03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:26.620]   because we as citizens have to make sure
[03:57:26.620 --> 03:57:31.620]   that America stays on the correct path,
[03:57:31.620 --> 03:57:36.960]   within the guard rails of what this country is based on.
[03:57:36.960 --> 03:57:39.380]   So we do have to pay attention,
[03:57:39.380 --> 03:57:43.600]   but I will be doing my part as a civilian
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:46.800]   until there's total mayhem and chaos in the streets.
[03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:48.960]   Then I'll probably just be a benevolent dictator
[03:57:48.960 --> 03:57:50.820]   that takes over. (laughs)
[03:57:50.820 --> 03:57:52.000]   - Should be an interesting one,
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:55.040]   but hey, you would be the man to lead under any conditions.
[03:57:55.040 --> 03:57:57.620]   But thank you for stating your threshold.
[03:57:57.620 --> 03:57:59.720]   Certainly you've earned the right to make whatever decision
[03:57:59.720 --> 03:58:00.960]   is that you feel is right for you.
[03:58:00.960 --> 03:58:03.060]   And I want to say that I agree.
[03:58:03.060 --> 03:58:05.140]   I feel like we are a country that still includes
[03:58:05.140 --> 03:58:07.820]   a ton of generators and a ton of projectors
[03:58:07.820 --> 03:58:09.360]   that are interested in projecting the good
[03:58:09.360 --> 03:58:10.640]   and growing the good.
[03:58:10.640 --> 03:58:14.360]   I do believe both those phenotypes are important.
[03:58:14.360 --> 03:58:17.620]   I also want to just say thank you for being a generator
[03:58:17.620 --> 03:58:20.320]   of so much useful knowledge.
[03:58:20.320 --> 03:58:23.540]   In science, we have a saying which is,
[03:58:23.540 --> 03:58:25.100]   somebody is an N of one.
[03:58:25.100 --> 03:58:28.060]   This is a rare thing to hear about oneself
[03:58:28.060 --> 03:58:29.500]   or to hear about somebody,
[03:58:29.500 --> 03:58:31.820]   because what it means is that somebody is in a category
[03:58:31.820 --> 03:58:34.620]   in which pretty much everything that they do and they say
[03:58:34.620 --> 03:58:37.080]   matters and serves a purpose,
[03:58:37.080 --> 03:58:39.900]   which is a useful and important building purpose.
[03:58:39.900 --> 03:58:42.180]   And I will look at you and tell you
[03:58:42.180 --> 03:58:44.300]   that you are an N of one.
[03:58:44.300 --> 03:58:47.820]   You certainly would meet that criteria under any conditions.
[03:58:47.820 --> 03:58:50.700]   And it's evident in the many companies that you're running
[03:58:50.700 --> 03:58:52.620]   and the leadership that you're doing.
[03:58:52.620 --> 03:58:54.060]   And also in your online presence.
[03:58:54.060 --> 03:58:56.720]   I mean, that's how I initially came to learn about you.
[03:58:56.720 --> 03:59:00.900]   I'm now fortunate to have two lengthy conversations with you
[03:59:00.900 --> 03:59:02.700]   and a few interspersed as well.
[03:59:02.700 --> 03:59:05.660]   And I think of myself as a reasonable
[03:59:05.660 --> 03:59:07.920]   to perhaps good observer of like how people behave
[03:59:07.920 --> 03:59:08.760]   in different domains.
[03:59:08.760 --> 03:59:12.400]   And every time you post or every time you speak
[03:59:12.400 --> 03:59:15.820]   or every time you go on a podcast or host a podcast,
[03:59:15.820 --> 03:59:18.420]   it's clear that not only are you prepared
[03:59:18.420 --> 03:59:21.460]   and not only you approaching it with a spirit of
[03:59:22.460 --> 03:59:24.180]   of seriousness that it deserves,
[03:59:24.180 --> 03:59:26.260]   but sometimes also lightness that it deserves,
[03:59:26.260 --> 03:59:28.780]   but there's always an element of give
[03:59:28.780 --> 03:59:30.140]   and that you're trying to encourage people
[03:59:30.140 --> 03:59:31.340]   to do better for themselves.
[03:59:31.340 --> 03:59:34.000]   So as somebody who's greatly benefited from the knowledge
[03:59:34.000 --> 03:59:36.020]   that you've put out there from the very first Tim Ferriss
[03:59:36.020 --> 03:59:38.640]   and Joe Rogan episodes to your own podcast,
[03:59:38.640 --> 03:59:40.900]   I want to extend a personal thanks.
[03:59:40.900 --> 03:59:44.020]   I also want to extend great thanks for coming on here today,
[03:59:44.020 --> 03:59:46.860]   talking to a geek scientist who also happens to be
[03:59:46.860 --> 03:59:49.460]   a fellow punk rocker because that spirit
[03:59:49.460 --> 03:59:51.140]   and the heart that's behind it.
[03:59:51.140 --> 03:59:53.900]   I think some people think it's all about noise and chaos.
[03:59:53.900 --> 03:59:56.200]   It's actually about being really true to yourself.
[03:59:56.200 --> 03:59:57.940]   That's how I think about the punk rock spirit
[03:59:57.940 --> 03:59:59.060]   is really about being true to yourself
[03:59:59.060 --> 04:00:00.940]   and realizing that the thing that you like
[04:00:00.940 --> 04:00:03.220]   while it might be quite different is actually,
[04:00:03.220 --> 04:00:06.100]   if that's you, you have to live in that vein
[04:00:06.100 --> 04:00:06.940]   and stick with it.
[04:00:06.940 --> 04:00:07.980]   It certainly served me well
[04:00:07.980 --> 04:00:09.300]   and it sounds like it served you well.
[04:00:09.300 --> 04:00:12.520]   But mostly I just want to extend an enormous thank you.
[04:00:12.520 --> 04:00:15.240]   As a civilian, thank you for the work you did
[04:00:15.240 --> 04:00:17.220]   in the military, but also teaching people
[04:00:17.220 --> 04:00:18.420]   about the military.
[04:00:18.420 --> 04:00:20.400]   I think a lot of people don't realize what it's about
[04:00:20.400 --> 04:00:23.380]   at any level and learning about your experience there
[04:00:23.380 --> 04:00:25.980]   and what you've observed, bringing other people's
[04:00:25.980 --> 04:00:27.980]   experiences from the military more broadly
[04:00:27.980 --> 04:00:29.980]   is super important and sharing this
[04:00:29.980 --> 04:00:32.700]   and being able to entertain some of my scientific rifts.
[04:00:32.700 --> 04:00:36.320]   So thank you, thank you, thank you.
[04:00:36.320 --> 04:00:41.460]   - Well, I appreciate it, I can, it's kind of weird.
[04:00:41.460 --> 04:00:42.820]   You say all these nice things to me.
[04:00:42.820 --> 04:00:44.220]   I definitely don't deserve them.
[04:00:44.220 --> 04:00:47.620]   I'm kind of a regular dude that just kind of showed up,
[04:00:47.620 --> 04:00:50.940]   I guess, at the right time and told some stories
[04:00:50.940 --> 04:00:53.440]   about some guys that were true heroes
[04:00:53.440 --> 04:00:57.940]   and just trying to share my perspective,
[04:00:57.940 --> 04:01:00.100]   but it's not just my perspective.
[04:01:00.100 --> 04:01:03.100]   I'm talking about stories that I lived,
[04:01:03.100 --> 04:01:05.300]   but there's plenty of people that have done way more
[04:01:05.300 --> 04:01:09.060]   than I've ever done and sacrificed infinitely more
[04:01:09.060 --> 04:01:10.340]   than I ever sacrificed.
[04:01:10.340 --> 04:01:14.640]   So I'm thankful for being here.
[04:01:14.640 --> 04:01:17.600]   I know that you put all kinds of information
[04:01:17.600 --> 04:01:21.700]   and the same back at you, I have greatly benefited
[04:01:21.700 --> 04:01:23.300]   from the information that you put out.
[04:01:23.300 --> 04:01:27.800]   And so I thank you as well and appreciate coming on here
[04:01:27.800 --> 04:01:29.500]   and appreciate you spreading the word
[04:01:29.500 --> 04:01:31.900]   about how people can be better yourself.
[04:01:31.900 --> 04:01:34.460]   So thanks for having me, I appreciate it, man.
[04:01:34.460 --> 04:01:36.400]   - I appreciate you and appreciate this time
[04:01:36.400 --> 04:01:37.540]   and let's do it again.
[04:01:37.540 --> 04:01:38.620]   - Check.
[04:01:38.620 --> 04:01:40.660]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[04:01:40.660 --> 04:01:41.940]   with Jocko Willink.
[04:01:41.940 --> 04:01:43.980]   I hope you learned as much as I did
[04:01:43.980 --> 04:01:46.100]   in terms of actionable knowledge to use
[04:01:46.100 --> 04:01:47.800]   in our everyday lives.
[04:01:47.800 --> 04:01:50.080]   If you'd like to learn more about Jocko's work
[04:01:50.080 --> 04:01:51.640]   and the various things he's involved in,
[04:01:51.640 --> 04:01:53.720]   please check out the Jocko podcast.

[04:01:58.660 --> 04:02:01.700]   on leadership, both for adults and for kids,
[04:02:01.700 --> 04:02:03.600]   and check out some of the other links
[04:02:03.600 --> 04:02:05.840]   that relate to some of his other business ventures.

[04:02:19.440 --> 04:02:20.940]   If you have questions for us

[04:02:29.160 --> 04:02:30.960]   I do read all the comments.
[04:02:30.960 --> 04:02:32.880]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[04:02:32.880 --> 04:02:35.720]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.

[04:02:38.060 --> 04:02:40.160]   On various episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[04:02:40.160 --> 04:02:41.600]   we discuss supplements.
[04:02:41.600 --> 04:02:43.820]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[04:02:43.820 --> 04:02:45.940]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[04:02:45.940 --> 04:02:49.440]   for things like enhancing sleep, focus, hormone support,
[04:02:49.440 --> 04:02:51.040]   and many other features of mental health,
[04:02:51.040 --> 04:02:52.800]   physical health, and performance.
[04:02:52.800 --> 04:02:54.840]   Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnered
[04:02:54.840 --> 04:02:56.480]   with Momentous Supplements.
[04:02:56.480 --> 04:02:59.160]   Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality,
[04:02:59.160 --> 04:03:01.880]   and they focus on single ingredient formulations,
[04:03:01.880 --> 04:03:03.860]   which is very important if you are going to develop
[04:03:03.860 --> 04:03:06.800]   the most cost-effective and biologically effective
[04:03:06.800 --> 04:03:08.580]   supplement regimen for you.
[04:03:08.580 --> 04:03:10.640]   In addition, they ship internationally,
[04:03:10.640 --> 04:03:12.800]   which is important because I know many of you reside
[04:03:12.800 --> 04:03:14.280]   outside of the United States.
[04:03:14.280 --> 04:03:15.840]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[04:03:15.840 --> 04:03:20.200]   on this podcast, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[04:03:20.200 --> 04:03:22.120]   and there you can also get 20% off
[04:03:22.120 --> 04:03:24.460]   any of Momentous Supplements.

[04:03:26.440 --> 04:03:29.000]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,
[04:03:29.000 --> 04:03:32.360]   and LinkedIn, and in particular on Instagram,
[04:03:32.360 --> 04:03:34.280]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[04:03:34.280 --> 04:03:36.120]   some of which overlap with the contents
[04:03:36.120 --> 04:03:37.660]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[04:03:37.660 --> 04:03:39.540]   much of which is distinct, however,
[04:03:39.540 --> 04:03:41.280]   from the contents of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[04:03:41.280 --> 04:03:44.360]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[04:03:44.360 --> 04:03:46.100]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[04:03:46.100 --> 04:03:47.740]   to our neural network newsletter,
[04:03:47.740 --> 04:03:50.360]   it's a zero-cost monthly newsletter.
[04:03:50.360 --> 04:03:51.980]   You simply sign up with your email
[04:03:51.980 --> 04:03:53.840]   by going to HubermanLab.com.
[04:03:53.840 --> 04:03:56.460]   The newsletter includes summaries of podcast episodes.
[04:03:56.460 --> 04:03:59.480]   We have toolkits for sleep, toolkits for focus,
[04:03:59.480 --> 04:04:01.580]   toolkits related to deliberate cold exposure,
[04:04:01.580 --> 04:04:03.280]   heat exposure, and much, much more.
[04:04:03.280 --> 04:04:04.880]   Again, all zero cost.
[04:04:04.880 --> 04:04:06.300]   You provide your email to sign up.
[04:04:06.300 --> 04:04:08.260]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[04:04:08.260 --> 04:04:10.360]   There are also sample newsletters there
[04:04:10.360 --> 04:04:11.600]   that you don't even need to sign up for.
[04:04:11.600 --> 04:04:12.840]   You can just download the PDF
[04:04:12.840 --> 04:04:15.580]   or just view them on your computer or phone screen.
[04:04:15.580 --> 04:04:17.000]   Thank you once again for joining me
[04:04:17.000 --> 04:04:19.080]   for my discussion with Jocko Willink.
[04:04:19.080 --> 04:04:22.040]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[04:04:22.040 --> 04:04:24.620]   [upbeat music]
[04:04:24.620 --> 04:04:27.200]   (upbeat music)
