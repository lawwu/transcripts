[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Well, can we just skip over those few bits of the New Testament that seem to have been
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.560]   added to the original manuscripts? What are we supposed to do with those sections? Do
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.960]   we preach through them on Sundays? And most significantly, don't these sections undermine
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.360]   the reliability of our Bibles? So great questions today in the inbox from an anonymous listener,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.980]   a woman who writes this, "Dear Pastor John, I've recently discovered that many theologians
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.440]   do not believe John 7, verse 53 through John 8, verse 11 should be in the Bible because
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.060]   it was added later and is not found in the oldest Greek manuscripts we have. Even notes
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.820]   within current translations will admit the story was not found in the early manuscripts.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.840]   This has shaken my confidence in the English Bible. Even one of my Muslim friends says
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.540]   this proves the corruption of the Bible. I don't know how to respond. How does it not
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.840]   undermine our confidence in our English Bibles?"
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.240]   On March 6, 2011, I preached one of the most unusual messages I've ever preached, because
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:22.540]   I preached it on this passage, John 7, 53 to 8, 11, a story that I agree was probably
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.840]   not part of the original Gospel of John. And there, in that sermon, which is at Desiring
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.400]   God, I dealt with the problems more fully than I can do it here. So I would encourage
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.240]   folks to go read or listen to that message at Desiring God. It's called "Neither Do I
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   Condemn You." The date is March 6, 2011. But here, in this brief podcast, let me give
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:02.120]   three reasons, or clusters of reasons maybe, why we can be confident that the text of our
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.500]   New Testament corresponds to what the original authors wrote and have not been distorted
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.060]   in transmission.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.480]   Number one, the traditional Muslim claim—and this is a street argument and a university
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.280]   argument, and I've dealt with it at both levels with people—the traditional Muslim
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.880]   claim that the text of the New Testament has been corrupted, and that behind the text of
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.520]   the New Testament there was another text in which Jesus did not die on the cross, and
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.440]   there was no atonement through his death, no covering for sins, no sacrifice, and there
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:00.740]   was no resurrection three days later. That claim, that Muslim claim, has zero historical
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.140]   manuscript evidence supporting it. In other words, there are no historical manuscripts
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:19.640]   of that nature. None. This is simply an Islamic theological claim, not a historical reality.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.280]   And you can simply ask your Muslim friend to point you to any, any manuscript evidence
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.880]   at all that there was another version of the New Testament that portrayed Jesus differently
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.540]   than we have in the New Testament of our Bibles. They don't have it. They won't be able
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.360]   to point you to it or offer it up. They only have a claim, and it's amazing how they
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.240]   get away with using this when there is no historical manuscript evidence to make the
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.180]   claim at all. So that's number one. Number two, even though the first printed New Testament
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:10.620]   appeared in 1516, and therefore up till that time, for 1500 years, the New Testament had
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.140]   been handed down by scribes, being copied by hand, nevertheless, almost all text-critical
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.980]   scholars—these are the scholars who specialize in doing the analysis of the many texts that
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.740]   we have to see if we can discern the original wording—almost all text-critical scholars,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.220]   both theological conservatives and theological liberals. I could tell a story about my three
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.980]   years in Germany where I thought I would have to establish the text of the passage I was
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.980]   working on, and they just waved it away and said, "Oh, we've got the reliable text.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.740]   You don't even worry about that." Virtually all those scholars agree that the enormous
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:04.740]   abundance of those manuscripts, as we compare them, make it possible to be sure we have
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.860]   a text that corresponds to what the original authors wrote. And the fact that there are
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:19.140]   some outliers, like Bart Ehrman, who write books to try to undermine the reliability
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.380]   of the actual text, his writings have not, among mainline scholars, conservative and
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.020]   liberal, found persuasion. And here's what's amazing. The abundance of these manuscripts
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.760]   of the New Testament, or parts of the New Testament, as compared with the number of
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:44.340]   manuscripts for other ancient works, is staggering. There are ten existing manuscripts for Julius
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.260]   Caesar's Gallic Wars, composed between 58 and 50 BC, and all of these date from the
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.780]   10th century or later. There are 20 manuscripts of Libby's Roman history, written roughly
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.500]   during the time when Jesus was alive. Only two manuscripts exist for Tacitus' histories
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.660]   and Annals, which were composed about AD 100, and one of them from the 9th century, the
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.580]   rest from later, the other from later. There are only eight manuscripts of the history
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.460]   of Thucydides, written between 460 and 400 BC. Now compare those numbers with the manuscripts
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.380]   or partial manuscripts of the New Testament. These numbers are from the Institute of New
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.460]   Testament Textual Research in Münster, Germany. Go online and see all these things for yourself.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.460]   Which is the most authoritative collection of such data in the world. There are 322 unsealed,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:49.460]   that is capital manuscripts, capitalized, 2,907 minuscule texts, 2,445 lectionary portions,
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.940]   127 papyri, for a total of 5,801 manuscripts of the New Testament part or whole. These
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.220]   are all handwritten copies of the New Testament or parts of the New Testament, preserved in
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.420]   libraries around the world today, and now captured electronically in digital format
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.240]   so that you can see them for yourself online. No other ancient book even comes remotely
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:24.260]   close to this kind of wealth of diverse preservation. Now it's true that the more manuscripts you
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:31.860]   have, the more variations you find. But on the other hand, and more importantly, the
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:39.340]   more manuscripts you have, the more control you have for discerning which readings are
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:46.160]   the original ones. Here's the way F.F. Bruce from a generation ago said it. "If the great
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.100]   number of manuscripts increases the number of scribal errors, it increases proportionately
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.780]   the means of correcting such errors so that the margin of doubt left in the process of
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.820]   recovering the exact original wording is in truth remarkably small." Now here's my third
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:14.020]   and final reason for encouragement and confidence. What is most significant for the reliability
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:22.100]   and authority of the New Testament is that the variations that textual critics are unsure
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:30.460]   of are not the kind that would change any Christian doctrine. That's really important.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.060]   So somebody might say, "Oh, there's hundreds and hundreds of variations." That's true.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:44.180]   F.F. Bruce says, "The variant readings about which any doubt remains among textual critics
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:54.980]   of the New Testament affects no material question of historic fact or of Christian faith and
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.100]   practice." Nothing on this score—and I say this because he wrote that book in 1943, and
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.620]   you might say, "Whoa, that's 70 years ago." Nothing on this score has changed in the last
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:14.060]   couple of generations since F.F. Bruce. In 2006, Paul Wegner reaffirmed Bruce's conclusion,
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.500]   and this is the book I would send people to if they want to get a book on this, A Student's
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.700]   Guide to Textual Criticism of the Bible by Paul Wegner. Here's what he says, "It is
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:30.020]   important to keep in perspective the fact that only a very small part of the text is
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:40.380]   in question, and of these, most variants make little difference to the meaning of any passage."
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.220]   When he closes his book—and I'm going to close this podcast by quoting Frederick
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:54.420]   Kenyon from earlier—"It is reassuring at the end to find that the general result of
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:01.540]   all these discoveries and all this study is to strengthen the proof of the authenticity
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:08.660]   of the Scriptures and our conviction that we have in our hands in substantial integrity
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:17.560]   the veritable Word of God." Now, how all this scientific work on the text relates to
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:26.180]   our spiritual assurance that is ready to die for the truth of sentences in the Bible, how
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:33.080]   this scientific work relates to that spiritual assurance is what I wrote a book about and
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:40.740]   published last year called A Peculiar Glory. And if that's the level at which people are
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:47.620]   going to struggle, then I offer them that as my effort to establish my own faith and
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.420]   to help other people. Maybe it would help them, too.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.660]   Yeah, that could be very helpful for listeners. There's so much reassurance just in those
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.500]   ancient manuscript comparison stats as well. Thank you, Pastor John, for that. And thank

[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.840]   But will profanity and crude talk make us more relatable and more effective in our engagement
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.980]   with this culture? The question comes up a lot in the inbox, and this time it arrives
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.920]   in an email from a podcast listener, a college student, who faces this question and all sorts
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.040]   of entailments with it on campus. And we are going to work through those questions next
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.920]   time when we return on Friday. I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
