[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   I took on the challenge to do 20,000 push-ups and pull-ups combined in 30 days. I did it for eight
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.960]   days, got hurt, now I'm back. I'm going to finish the job that I started. That means every day doing
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.400]   34 rounds of 15 push-ups, 5 pull-ups, and 10 squats. I'm using this clicker thing to keep
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.040]   track of the rounds. First day, 34 done. Last time around is one of the toughest things for
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.240]   me mentally and physically. I build up my base. I've lost weight. I'm continuing to lose weight.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.120]   I'm ready for this to hit hard and to get the job finished. It's going to take a lot to stop
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   me this time. A lot of people told me that when you do numbers like these, especially for 30 days,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.520]   you're going to get hurt. I don't care. I've been doing sports my whole life. I've wrestled in
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.720]   combat sports my whole life. I weightlifted my whole life. I've done crazy things athletically
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.120]   my whole life. I know what I'm doing. That said, I know how risky, how crazy, how tough this is on
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.560]   the body. And yes, injury is a real possibility. In fact, on day three is when my right shoulder
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.680]   started to develop pain, an old familiar overused pain that I know well. And I kept pushing. I kept
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.680]   pushing and pushing because pain is one thing, injury is another. So I kept really sensing of
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.480]   is it getting closer and closer to injury? This was the hardest mental challenge for me.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.080]   There's times where I had to lay face down on the carpet, just doubting everything about my life.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.720]   What am I doing with my life? Just all the flood of excuses coming into my head. It was all coming
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.880]   from the shoulder. The shoulder was running the body. The brain couldn't do anything with it.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.600]   And I think I'm really proud of pushing as far as eight days through that. But then I started to
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.760]   feel that injury is going to become a real possibility. So that's when I took a break on
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.880]   all the upper body exercises and started to do the recovery. Ice and bend exercises that I can talk
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.160]   about another time. Every single day. And I still ran six miles every single day until today. Today
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   I'm restarting that challenge. I finished the six miles again and the 34 rounds of 15 pushups,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.400]   five pull-ups and 10 squats. Now this is just some silly exercises, but a lot of people have told me
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.000]   that I'm going to get injured. A lot of people in my other aspects of my work have told me that I'm
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.160]   going to burn out. I'm going to work too hard. Those people need to unfollow me. That advice
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.960]   is obvious. Millions of people will tell you to do this. It's obvious. You should get enough sleep.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.600]   You should get a healthy, moderate dose of exercise. You should have a diet. You should
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.640]   have a balanced life. The thing that I need, and I believe the thing that a lot of people need,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.600]   is not that kind of advice. They need a small number of people around them to support them,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.200]   to push harder, to work harder, to take the risks. The quote unquote dumb thing to take the risk of
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.320]   injury, to take the risk of burnout in the name of passion, in the name of discovering something
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   about yourself. That's why I took on this challenge. That's why I'm talking to the crazy
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.880]   David Goggins, not because I'm trying to establish a healthy lifestyle, but because I'm trying to
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.000]   discover something about myself on the way of establishing a healthy lifestyle. I believe
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.600]   it's non-zero probability of me taking and finishing this challenge. That's why I took
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.680]   it on. That's why I kept pushing through the pain to discover something about myself,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.240]   the kind of things I need to fix up about the way I do the exercises, but also mentally. The
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.200]   most important things are the mentally. Now, that said, I didn't even hit, you know, David
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.120]   Goggins talks about the 40% rule. I don't think I even got into like the 5% for me. I know how to
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.320]   suffer. There are things in this life I'm willing to suffer for. They have to do much more with the
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.000]   things, my main passions in life and work and artificial intelligence. There's things I'm really
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.840]   willing to put in the work. Push-ups and pull-ups is not one of them. At the end of the day, I want
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   to establish a healthy habit where every single day I'm doing some running and some bodyweight
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   exercises that takes under an hour. That just keeps me healthy, keeps me feeling good, keeps
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.480]   me moving, keeps my immune system strong, just keeps me feeling great. I think there's a magic
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.720]   to exercise for clearing the mind, for just giving you this vibrant energy to hit whatever the heck
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.640]   you're working on in the rest of the day. I really think that people in academic circles and research
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.280]   circles, just engineers in general, need to get their butts out there and do some exercise. I
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.240]   think there's a huge amount of value to that, even if it's just walking. Get 10,000, 15,000,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.720]   20,000 steps a day. I think there's a huge value to that. I think a long time ago, I decided that
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.520]   I'm going to have to suffer to reach my goals. One of the things I learned about myself, at least,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.720]   maybe this applies to others, that the ability to withstand suffering, to really withstand the
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.760]   grind, is a kind of muscle that needs to be trained. You really do need to do something
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.640]   difficult every day. This push-up, pull-up thing is a representation of that, but I do something
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.520]   difficult every day. If you're following along, make sure you do something that's just a little
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.000]   bit crazy, that you push the limits. Do not injure yourself permanently, but do push yourself to a
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.320]   point where you learn something about yourself. Ignore all the excuses that your head comes up
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.440]   with for not doing it. Get your butt out there every single day. Try to get some miles in if
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.000]   you run or walk or bike or whatever, and try to do some things for the upper body, some bodyweight
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.480]   exercises. There's zero excuses not to do this in this pandemic. One of the biggest things you can
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.240]   do for yourself is to get the diet right, to get the exercise right. So get out there. Good luck.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   Stay healthy. Stay hard. I'll see you at the end of this 20,000 crazy push-up and pull-up thing
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.920]   that I promise I'll do, and I'll get the job done no matter what. Oh, one more thing. I know
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.280]   you're probably, somebody out there is probably typing how they didn't sign up to be listening to
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.440]   some Russian dude talk about some exercises. They want some artificial intelligence, lectures,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.680]   content, whatever the heck. That's what I do. That's my main passion, but I also exercise.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.280]   I also play music. I also love poetry and literature. That's what you get. If you don't
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.840]   like it, unsubscribe. It doesn't matter. This is me. I'm hoping to share and be open and real with
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:48.480]   people in my journey through this whole thing. I really have enjoyed the community that has sprung
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.800]   up around conversations I've had. There's so much love in this world that just energizes me and
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.400]   inspires me. That's why I do this thing. The exercise is just who I am. It's all part of my
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:09.360]   life. If you don't like it, sorry. If you like it, come along. Subscribe or don't. Doesn't matter.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   I love you all.
