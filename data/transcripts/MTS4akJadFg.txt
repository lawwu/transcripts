[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   All right, Jesse, so I think we should do some questions.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.600]   Yep.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.820]   You know what they come for.
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.320]   I got one here from Toby.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.140]   Toby asks, how do I improve my discipline?
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:19.120]   My problem is that I have a problem with sticking to my long term plans.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.500]   Well, Toby, I think about discipline really more as an identity that you
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.620]   develop, then I do an approach to a particular challenge.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.860]   If you can convince yourself that you are a disciplined person, that that is part
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.220]   of your conception of your identity, then you will be able to, with discipline,
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.680]   pursue many different important objectives in your life.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.640]   So the question is, how do you get to an identity where you see
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.980]   yourself as a disciplined person?
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.660]   Well, let me tell you what not to do.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.640]   Don't just pick out a random ambitious goal and say, you know what?
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.020]   I'm going to do this.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.760]   I'm going to, I'm going to white knuckle, go after this really hard goal.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.080]   And because I need to be more disciplined.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.760]   That's what you're trying to do.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.960]   That's not working.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.000]   I'm not surprised it's not working.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.760]   If you've not yet convinced yourself, you're a disciplined person, taking
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720]   on ad hoc, large discipline requiring challenges is not going
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.480]   to be a route towards success.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.120]   So what should you do instead?
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.480]   Well, I think this is where actually the deep life procedure I talk about, the,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.000]   the sort of self-awarely overly pragmatic approach to building a foundation for
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.360]   deep life that we've been talking about on the show for over two years is perfect.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560]   For developing a self-identity as disciplined.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.880]   So remember there's two parts to this.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.740]   Number one, you identify the areas of your life that are important to you.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.480]   We typically call these the deep life buckets.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.120]   They differ between different people, but our starter set of these buckets
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040]   tends to be craft, what you do, what you create, constitution.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.760]   That's going to be your health community.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.920]   That's going to be your connections to other people, be it your family,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.160]   your neighborhood, the people in the organizations where you work at
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   your religious institutions.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.820]   They'll often throw in contemplation.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.520]   We're trying to capture philosophy, theology, and ethics.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.380]   These are all important areas.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.280]   Most people's lives, your list might vary.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.000]   For each of these areas, the first thing to do is to identify a
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.360]   keystone habit, something in each of these buckets that you do every day.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   Something that is not trivial, but is also tractable and you track your
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.920]   completion of these habits every day.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.800]   If you use something like my time block planner, there's a metric
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000]   tracking space at the top of the daily planning pages on every day.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.400]   You just track those keystone habits right there.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.040]   So for example, for constitution, you wouldn't have something there.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.560]   Like I'm going to do a 45 minute intense workout because that's too hard to
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000]   expect you to be able to do that every day.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.640]   That's not really tractable, but you also don't want to say, you know, I
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.920]   will do one jumping jack when I get out of bed in the morning, like
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.920]   that's not going to get you anywhere.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.880]   So instead you might want to do something like I want to
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   hit this many steps in a day.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.480]   It'll require a little bit of planning.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.920]   Like I walk my kids to school.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.520]   I'll probably have to do one more walk in the afternoon in between meetings.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.800]   And, but it's tractable.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.840]   If I think about it, my friend, Brian Johnson, uh, of optimize fame had this
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.520]   great constitution habit where he had a fixed number of minutes that he never
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.760]   wanted to go beyond without doing, I think he would do 10 burpees and it was
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.120]   like 23 minutes or 20, there was some amount of time that he had, because he
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.280]   had read somewhere, if you sit for more than this much time, it starts to be bad.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.840]   And so it was just every, whatever it was, 23 minutes, he would do 10 burpees.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.720]   And was it a fantastic boom?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.840]   Now I think it helps that he doesn't work in the bullpen of a crowded office.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.760]   I mean, I, maybe that would be an awesome thing to do, but, but it probably
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.200]   would draw some interesting attention.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.080]   He, you know, he, he works in his own company, so he works at his own house.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.360]   Um, but 10 burpees, three times an hour, roughly.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.960]   And the way he pitched it to me is it keeps your ability to
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.320]   concentration, to concentrate like an, like a laser.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.360]   Cause your body's always moving.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   It never gets into a sedentary, but anyways, for someone who works in their
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.240]   own home, works from home on their own business, very tractable, very
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.120]   tractable, Keystone habit takes 15 seconds or whatever, every time you do it.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.200]   The fact that I think 10 burpees takes 15 seconds shows that I don't know.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.960]   I don't know a lot about burpees.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.880]   Does he still do that?
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.040]   I don't know.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.600]   We should have him on the show.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.720]   He should, we should, we should ask him.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.200]   I know at one point he was training, he was really into, and I don't think
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.960]   he will mind me telling this story because I think he's talked about it himself.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.280]   Um, he was really into Spartan racing.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.960]   You know, the Spartan races.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.720]   Because he, yeah, because he was friends with Joe Dacena.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.680]   So he knew the guy who started it and he was making a run at some point for doing
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.800]   them at a very high level, which requires, it turns out it requires a lot of training.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.560]   Uh, you have to master a lot of these individual disciplines, but anyways,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.680]   in his, his house, in the room where he worked, which I think might've been their
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.640]   bedroom, he had installed into the ceiling of the room, the, uh, hanging
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.880]   obstacles from the Sparta race.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.000]   Like, so I guess you do like Ninja warrior type stuff in that race.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.160]   We're like, you have to like, you're holding on to like rope knots and whatever.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.160]   And yeah, he installed them into the ceiling of the room so that when he was
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.480]   doing these breaks, he's like, instead of just burpees, let me jump up and just.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.560]   Like do the, whatever hanging challenge.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.320]   I'll tell you what you do that for a few months, your grip, strength and
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.400]   balance, like you just own it, but you don't even, and I guess that's what you
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.720]   need to do to compete at a high level.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.600]   You could just jump up there and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.360]   And so that's, that's commitment.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.840]   He'd probably still work out too during the day.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.360]   I would think separately.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.160]   So he, and he had a whole thing and yeah, so you still have a workout.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.080]   So it was less, this was less about, which again, I think is an important point.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.640]   Like if your keystone habits are not, their job is not to capture everything
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.480]   you need to do, or it's important for that bucket.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   So like getting up and doing some burpees or whatever throughout the day.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.960]   Is a great way of saying you, you take motion important.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.080]   You take your body important.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.960]   You think there's a mind body connection, but it's not everything
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.200]   you need to do for exercise.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.560]   You probably need to be doing weights.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.000]   You probably need to be doing cardio.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.560]   So that's, it's a good point is that your keystone habits are not trying to.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.480]   Take on the weight of everything important in that bucket.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.960]   They are just meant to say that you take that bucket seriously, and you're
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.120]   willing to take effort towards that bucket every day, that's non-trivial.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160]   Now it takes a while to get those keystone habits, right?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.280]   You have to experiment a little bit, but you get to the point where you're
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.000]   knocking off, you have four buckets or five buckets, you're checking off
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.560]   all those, all those metrics every day.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.280]   And you see it every day.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.480]   You don't want to break the chain.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.040]   All right.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.360]   That's step one.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   You've already now leveled up discipline.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.920]   Your identity as someone who's disciplined is now leveled up.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.680]   You do stuff that's optional because it reflects your values.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.760]   Even if it's hard.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   Now you're at a higher level.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   The next part of my general deep life foundation program is then you
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.200]   dedicate a one to two month period to each of those buckets one by one.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.160]   And overhaul that part of your life when you're focusing on that particular bucket.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.760]   So in the one to two months, you're focusing on constitution.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   Now you're getting serious about your health and fitness and you're
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.920]   starting to make changes and figuring out like, maybe you're like, I'm
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.520]   going to start training for this sport.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.720]   Like I'll tell you right now, Jesse, one of the things I'm doing.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:48.240]   It's a goal is before my 40th birthday, which is in June.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.520]   So it's coming up.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.840]   Um, you might not remember what it's like to be in your thirties.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.320]   Of course.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.760]   I mean, you've been 40 for literally weeks at this point.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.200]   So you probably don't remember.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.440]   But, uh, my birthday is coming up as we've talked about.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.800]   I want to, this is arbitrary, but I want to be able to once again,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:17.640]   row, uh, 2000 meters on my concept to at a sub two minute, 500 meter pace.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.760]   So this is connects me back to my, my, my deep past when I was rowing for Dartmouth.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.080]   I remember the type of splits I could pull.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.680]   So like seven and change.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:26.960]   Something.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.440]   So yeah.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.280]   And so I was like, I want to, I was like, I would feel good at the age of 40.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.560]   If, because I got, God knows what I could pull when I was 19 doing this, I could
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.760]   pull, but I'm 30 pounds heavier now.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.240]   So it does have an advantage.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.160]   Like I can actually, I was a lightweight rower, so I can now actually move that
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.400]   thing, but anyways, it's kind of arbitrary, but it's like, it's, it's hard.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.800]   But not impossible.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.880]   But like, I would feel good if I can be pulling sub two minute.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.000]   500 splits for, for a 2000 meters.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.640]   Like I'm training for that right now.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.880]   Uh, but that's the type of thing.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.120]   Okay.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.040]   When you're doing an overhaul of a bucket, you start, you
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.200]   figure out these challenges.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.240]   You get your equipment in place.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   I mean, not to make a full, full circle connection, but I got that
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.280]   concept too, actually from Brian Johnson.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.720]   Sent it to me as a gift.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.360]   So there we go.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.240]   It all nice gift.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.280]   He's a nice guy.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.720]   No, for a very long time.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.680]   Um, so anyways, that's the type of thing you will come away from doing the
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:24.600]   intense focus on the bucket with like, okay, now I'm going to start training
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.080]   to do this and I've overhauled my diet and I now am joined this team, this rec,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.360]   you know, with other dads that we play, whatever.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.800]   And so when you, you, you give the one to two month focus, you really are changing
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.440]   your life more substantially to, to really integrate that area of value.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.640]   Um, More deeply.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   And there's a lot of experimentation in that.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   That's why it takes one or two months.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.120]   You try some things it's not really working.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.400]   So you change your goals or challenges or habits.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.640]   So you find something that's really working.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.840]   You come out of that second step.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.960]   Toby, you're going to be a much more disciplined person.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.680]   Step one, you build that base with a keystone step to you.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.440]   Overhaul tractable overhauls to experimentation.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.680]   All the parts are important to your life after that.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.000]   Now it's down the line.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   You're like, oh, here's a new long-term plan that I believe in.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   Let me do some work towards it.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.560]   No problem.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.800]   That's that's what you do.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.640]   You're disciplined.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.600]   That's what you're gonna do.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.360]   That's what you're going to do.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.120]   So once you've changed the identity, then you can take on new challenges.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.480]   The only final thing I'll say is even as a very self-disciplined person, if
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.360]   your challenges don't make sense, if your mind doesn't believe that it's worth
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.840]   doing or that your plan is actually going to accomplish what it is, you
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.040]   will still struggle with discipline.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.640]   So you have to be selective and careful in laying out what you do.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.480]   Your brain is not dumb.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.360]   If you're like, I'm going to be a Nobel prize winning novelist because I'm going
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.480]   to do national novel writing month.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.280]   Three days in your mind's like, this is stupid.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.720]   We don't know what we're doing.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.040]   This is not a good book.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.400]   I'm not going to do this.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.520]   And that's not a failure of discipline.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.320]   That's a failure of planning.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.720]   So that's the only other copy I'll give.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.320]   Even after you become a self-disciplined person, you need goals your mind actually
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.080]   trust.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.880]   (upbeat music)
