[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.200]   Today is an Ask Me Anything or AMA episode,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880]   which is part of our premium subscriber content.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.200]   which still comes out once a week, every Monday,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.460]   and of course is zero cost to consumer.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.960]   The premium channel is also designed to support
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   exciting research being done at major universities
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.940]   like Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.080]   research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.440]   for mental health, physical health, and performance
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   in the near future.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   If you'd like to check out
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.500]   the premium channel subscription model,

[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.140]   Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers,
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760]   you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.500]   of this episode, and hopefully that will allow you
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.040]   to discern whether or not you would like
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.780]   to become a premium subscriber.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.760]   Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.720]   And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.280]   as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.840]   The first question is about how to improve sleep,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.420]   in particular, how to improve deep sleep
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.620]   that is sometimes called slow wave sleep.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.680]   This was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.160]   and they got a lot of upvotes.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.840]   Now, we've done multiple full length episodes
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.720]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast on sleep
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.240]   and tools to improve sleep,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.120]   including the master your sleep episode
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.180]   and perfect your sleep episode,
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.320]   as well as a toolkit that is available
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.480]   at completely zero cost at HubermanLab.com.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.680]   It's a downloadable PDF that lists out the behavioral tools
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.200]   and other tools that you can implement
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.760]   to improve your sleep.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.480]   Now, Jack's question is specifically
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.720]   about how to improve deep sleep.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.000]   He asks, I have a sleep analyzer,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.800]   and I typically observe that I get a lot of REM sleep,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   that is rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.280]   For him, he says it's 30% of his total sleep
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.620]   is rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.620]   But he asks, my deep sleep is often low, around 10%.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.800]   And I would like to know if there are any science-backed
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.620]   protocols I can use to specifically increase my deep sleep.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.240]   Okay, so for those of you that may not know,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.860]   what is deep sleep?
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.520]   Now, deep sleep is sometimes referred to as slow wave sleep.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.720]   That is, slow wave sleep and deep sleep
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.800]   are sometimes used interchangeably
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.160]   to describe the same thing.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.920]   They aren't necessarily the same thing,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.420]   but they fall under the same mechanistic umbrella.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.280]   What is that mechanistic umbrella?
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.880]   Well, when you go to sleep at night,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.520]   you cycle through a number of different stages of sleep.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   And in the early part of the night,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.880]   I would say in the first half of your night or so,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.720]   most of your sleep is going to be slow wave deep sleep.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.080]   But then as you transition into the second half
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.540]   of your night, more of your sleep
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.800]   will be rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.520]   And that's the typical pattern that is observed
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.920]   when you're not disrupting your sleep architecture
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.640]   with things like caffeine and alcohol.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.220]   We'll talk about caffeine and alcohol in a few minutes.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.360]   Deep sleep, AKA slow wave sleep,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.920]   at least for sake of this conversation,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.560]   is vitally important in particular
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.880]   for repair of bodily tissues.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.480]   During deep sleep, you secrete growth hormone.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.200]   And in fact, you secrete growth hormone every night
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.400]   when you go to sleep.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.140]   But most of that growth hormone release
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.400]   is restricted to the first half of your sleep night.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.680]   The other feature of deep sleep
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.560]   is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.480]   tend to be of a less emotional nature
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.580]   than the sorts of dreams that one experiences
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.540]   in rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.940]   So just to give a broad top contour
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.460]   of what deep sleep, AKA slow wave sleep, is really about,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.720]   it tends to occur in the first half of the night.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.300]   It also occurs in the second half of the night,
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.380]   but in the first half of the night,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.500]   most of your sleep is going to be occupied
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.080]   by deep sleep, AKA slow wave sleep.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.860]   It is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.760]   in part by release of growth hormone,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.020]   which is involved in metabolism,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.880]   but also protein synthesis, muscle repair,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.580]   repair of all cell types and tissues.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.080]   And during deep sleep,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.840]   your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   sometimes a little bizarre,
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.200]   but typically not very emotionally loaded.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.360]   That can change if you're dealing
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.520]   with a lot of emotionally laden circumstances
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.740]   in your waking life.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.900]   But in general, the sleep and dreams that occur
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.500]   in the first part of the night is deep,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.740]   and it's not terribly emotionally ridden.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.740]   Your body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.040]   This relates to recent findings just this last year
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.420]   in which researchers monitored the output of people's breath
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.820]   and the various metabolic factors present in the breath,
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.560]   as well as through blood draws.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.700]   So basically doing all this
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.580]   while people are asleep in a laboratory.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.640]   And they observed that during the first half of the night,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.540]   while people are in deep sleep,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.960]   their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.660]   than it does in the second half of the night.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.540]   I'll come back to this in a little while,
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.920]   but this turns out to be very important
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   for establishing your metabolism
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.660]   and the way you regulate insulin
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.060]   and blood glucose during the daytime.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.620]   So all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep,
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.060]   slow wave sleep, is vitally important.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.300]   And Jack's asking how he can increase the amount
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.420]   of deep sleep that he's getting
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.020]   because by his sleep tracking method,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.740]   he's observing far less deep sleep
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.300]   than rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.460]   Now that raises the question of how much deep sleep
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.500]   one should be getting overall.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.180]   In general, the goal should be to balance
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.860]   the total amount of slow wave sleep
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.260]   and rapid eye movement sleep across the night.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.100]   However, I would not want people to obsess
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.220]   over getting exactly 30% rapid eye movement sleep
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.340]   and exactly 30% slow wave sleep.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.140]   Your body is much more resilient than that.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.820]   But the closer those two numbers are to one another,
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.300]   the better overall architecture of your sleep.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.060]   And he doesn't list out exactly
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.860]   how he's measuring his sleep.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.140]   So I do want to put an asterisk on both the question
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.060]   and the answer I provide by stating
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.440]   that a lot of sleep trackers,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.980]   whether or not they are whoop trackers or auras,
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.180]   or whether or not you're using a mattress-based
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.860]   or mattress cover-based sleep tracker
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.740]   like eight sleep or other,
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.460]   is using heart rate and heart rate variability
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.460]   and body movement to estimate or to kind of predict
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.340]   whether or not you're in slow wave sleep
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.420]   or rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.980]   And that's because during rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.160]   you tend to be in what's called atonia.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.400]   You tend to be paralyzed.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.780]   You can't move.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.700]   And during slow wave sleep, that's not the case.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.800]   But no matter what the sleep tracking method is,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.420]   if it's a standard commercial sleep tracking method,
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.600]   whoop, aura, eight sleep, et cetera,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.420]   it is an estimate or a best guess
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.700]   at what stage of sleep you're in.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.660]   Whereas when you go into a sleep laboratory
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.180]   like the sleep laboratory at Stanford,
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.380]   at University of Pennsylvania,
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.540]   or other of the great sleep laboratories that are out there,
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.180]   they're going to use other methods, including EEG and EMG.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.220]   These are just acronyms
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.440]   that refer to ways to record brain waves.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.460]   They actually are going to try and observe
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.080]   for rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids, et cetera.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.920]   So sleep trackers give you a best guess
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.740]   as to what stage of sleep you're in.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.220]   They are not perfectly accurate.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.820]   At least none of the commercially available sleep trackers
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.860]   are perfectly accurate.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.480]   So we do want to highlight that.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.660]   Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly,
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.780]   which is how to increase the total amount of slow wave sleep.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.380]   Well, there are a couple of ways.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.860]   First of all, are the don'ts,
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.180]   and then we'll talk about the dos.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.080]   Two things that you can do
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.840]   to really disrupt your slow wave sleep
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.300]   are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime,
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.240]   or even at all.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.860]   Some people will find that even if they have a glass of wine
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.100]   or a beer with lunch, that the amount of slow wave sleep,
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.660]   and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.060]   that they get at night is reduced,
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.260]   and that their overall sleep architecture is disrupted.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.140]   This has been shown again and again.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.420]   Likewise, avoiding caffeine within eight,
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.420]   and ideally within 12 hours of bedtime would be preferable.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.900]   And if you're not a caffeine drinker,
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.420]   obviously you don't have to worry about this at all,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.700]   but avoiding caffeine intake within that eight
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.500]   to 12 hours of bedtime will greatly assist
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.180]   in you getting more slow wave sleep
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.400]   and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.660]   This has been shown again and again.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   And as well, avoiding cannabis use and maybe even CBD use
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.220]   within eight to 12 hours of sleep can be very beneficial
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.680]   if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.620]   Now, I know a lot of people rely on alcohol,
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.180]   cannabis, and CBD in order to get into sleep.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.460]   However, it's been shown many times in human studies,
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.860]   and this was discussed in the podcast episode
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.640]   that we did with the great Matt Walker,
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.200]   who's a professor of neuroscience and psychology
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.620]   at University of California, Berkeley,
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.740]   and a world expert in sleep and sleep science.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.300]   Matt and I discussed the research showing
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.140]   that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep,
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.300]   even though cannabis can help you fall asleep,
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.780]   and even though CBD can help people fall asleep,
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.580]   that it does disrupt and in many ways
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.420]   reduce the quality of sleep that one gets.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.740]   So that's disappointing news.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.880]   I know for a number of the people that rely on cannabis,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.620]   CBD, or alcohol to fall asleep,
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.100]   but I would encourage you to check out the episodes
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.460]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast that we did about alcohol
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.760]   and about cannabis,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.580]   including some of the health benefits of cannabis
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.020]   in certain situations,
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.880]   but also some of the detrimental effects
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.660]   of both alcohol and cannabis in other situations,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.740]   in particular for improving slow wave sleep.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.960]   So that's actually three major don'ts.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.360]   Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.880]   and let's put under the umbrella of cannabis,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.460]   THC and CBD in the eight,
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.980]   and ideally within the 12 hours prior to sleep.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.340]   If your goal is to improve the total amount
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.340]   of slow wave sleep that you're getting
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.940]   and your overall sleep architecture.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.940]   In addition, it's well-known that avoiding food intake
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.340]   in the two hours prior to sleep
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.300]   is going to greatly assist
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.620]   in the amount of growth hormone output that you achieve
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.160]   during the early stages of the night
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.200]   and the depth and duration of slow wave sleep.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.700]   Now, I want to place an asterisk on that statement
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.980]   by saying if you go to sleep too hungry,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.620]   it can also disrupt your sleep.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.980]   So you're going to have to arrange your eating schedule
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.060]   and your sleeping schedule
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.820]   such that you're not eating too close to bedtime,
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.620]   but you're also not going to bed so hungry
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.800]   that you can't fall asleep
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.260]   or that you don't get into deep sleep and stay asleep.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.900]   I can personally attest to the fact
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.700]   that if I'm too hungry, I can't fall asleep.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.180]   Now, for me, most nights I'm going to eat dinner
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.580]   sometime between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.,
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.620]   depending on time of year,
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.820]   schedules, what's going on, traffic, et cetera.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.780]   And I tend to go to sleep
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.440]   somewhere between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., plus or minus an hour.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.300]   Again, depending on time of year
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.940]   and what else is going on in life.
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.900]   So I normally have that buffer of two hours or so
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.020]   before going to sleep.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.260]   However, there are some nights
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.380]   where even if I eat dinner around 7 p.m.,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.580]   I'm quite hungry at 9 p.m. and I want to go to sleep.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.780]   In that case, eating a small amount of food
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.700]   ought not to disrupt your slow wave sleep too much,
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.660]   but you do want to avoid eating large meals
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.220]   right before going to sleep unless, okay,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.820]   unless completely fasting and not eating something
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.820]   late at night will prevent you
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.460]   from getting into any sleep at all.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.760]   In other words, it's better to make sure
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.380]   that you're getting to sleep than it is to avoid food
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.860]   just so that you get increased growth hormone output
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.540]   and into slow wave sleep.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.020]   I hope that's clear.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.220]   You know, I have had times in my life
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.380]   where I'm working very, very hard
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.060]   and I miss dinner or something comes up
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.180]   and I know some people can fall asleep
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.980]   quite easily on an empty stomach.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.880]   I've been able to do that.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.920]   In particular, if I'm very exhausted,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.140]   I also rely on a handful of supplements
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.580]   to fall asleep each night,
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.440]   although I'm not dependent on them.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.700]   There've been times when I haven't been able
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.140]   to access those supplements and I can still fall asleep.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.000]   But the point is that you don't want to be so hungry
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.820]   that you can't fall asleep.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.140]   And yet in an ideal circumstance,
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.540]   especially if you're trying to increase
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.700]   the amount of slow wave sleep,
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   you would avoid food in the two hours or so
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.180]   before going to sleep.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.460]   If you can avoid food for the three or four hours
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.440]   prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.240]   that's even better for sake of increasing
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.080]   slow wave sleep and growth hormone output.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.160]   Now, there are some additional tools
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.920]   for improving slow wave sleep.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.200]   In particular, the transitions between slow wave sleep
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.680]   and the other sleep stages.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.800]   Because even though, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.200]   the early part of your night is occupied primarily
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.920]   by slow wave sleep, all night long,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.300]   you're transitioning from slow wave sleep
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.960]   into an intermediate stage of sleep
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.140]   and then into rapid eye movement sleep and then back again.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.220]   It's just that in the early part of the night,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.060]   more of that time is going to be occupied
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.120]   by slow wave sleep.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.980]   The two ways to improve slow wave sleep
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.820]   that are well-documented in the literature,
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.680]   and here we can point to some really nice papers
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.460]   that I'll reference in case you want to read further,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.400]   is the first one is entitled,
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.780]   "Exercise improves the quality of slow wave sleep
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.600]   by increasing slow wave stability."
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.760]   Slow wave stability has to do with,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.480]   as researchers call it, the amount of power present
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.400]   in the different aspects of slow wave sleep.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.040]   So this gets a little bit technical,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.640]   but this is an instance in which they brought subjects
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.680]   into the laboratory, they measured brainwaves by EEG,
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.000]   they had some other measurements as well,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.040]   including subjective measures of sleep,
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.780]   and they looked at whether or not people
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.480]   were doing exercise or not prior to sleep.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.960]   Now, when I say prior to sleep,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.760]   I mean not within six hours prior to bedtime.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.300]   In fact, exercising intensely
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.640]   in the six hours prior to bedtime for many people,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.780]   not all, but for many people,
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.400]   can disrupt the total amount of slow wave sleep
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.240]   that they get and can also disrupt rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.140]   So the conditions of the study were pretty straightforward.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.400]   It was a randomized crossover trial.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.640]   Basically, they had people either sleeping
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.680]   and monitoring their sleep,
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.660]   or they had people doing an hour of exercise
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.880]   at 60% of their so-called VO2 max,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.920]   you can look this up, for 60 minutes, okay?
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.080]   60% of their VO2 max, that was the intensity.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.560]   It's breathing pretty hard, but not extremely hard.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.880]   If we were going to map that to the so-called zone,
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.640]   zone two cardio being the kind of cardio
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.360]   you can do steady state while holding a conversation,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.540]   this would be somewhere in the probably zone three
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.500]   or zone four, although that's not exactly
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.320]   what 60% of VO2 max is going to map to every time.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.240]   Think about relatively challenging cardiovascular output
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.300]   for 60 minutes, and they had them do that
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.820]   at least six hours prior to bedtime.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.640]   And this is an important end,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.000]   they did have the subjects in this study
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.480]   in all conditions abstain from caffeine and alcohol.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.640]   So that's very important.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.060]   And what they observed was an enhancement
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.500]   of slow wave sleep.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.360]   So exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.860]   of improving slow wave sleep.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.840]   Now, I do not know because the study,
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.600]   as far as I know, has not been done,
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.060]   whether or not doing resistance training
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.960]   or some other type of exercise
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.700]   would have led to the same effect.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.520]   Although I have to imagine that if it's moderately intense
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.540]   to intense resistance training,
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.240]   provided it's done far enough away from going to sleep,
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.680]   prior to six hours before sleep,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.200]   that one ought to see the same effects,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.360]   although that was not a condition in this study.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.840]   But it's a very nice study.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.560]   They looked at everything from changes
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.600]   in core body temperature to caloric expenditure.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.900]   They didn't see huge changes
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.400]   in core body temperature changes,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.280]   so that couldn't explain the effect.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.940]   It really appears that the major effect
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.740]   of improving slow wave sleep was due to something
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.880]   in changing the fine structure of the brain waves
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.760]   that occur during slow wave sleep.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.400]   In fact, and this is an important point,
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.120]   the subjects in this study did not report subjectively
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.680]   feeling that much better from their sleep.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.520]   So you might say,
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.120]   "Well, then why would I even want to bother?"
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.320]   However, it's well known
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.700]   that getting sufficient slow wave sleep is important,
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.600]   not just for repair, excuse me,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.800]   for repair of bodily tissues,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.160]   but also for repair of brain tissues
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.880]   and repair and wash out of debris in the brain.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.100]   And that debris is known to lead to things like dementia.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.960]   So getting the best quality slow wave sleep
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.240]   is extremely important for body and for brain,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.300]   and getting an hour of exercise that's moderately intense,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.640]   and making sure that you're not doing that exercise
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.960]   within the six hours prior to bedtime,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.040]   and avoiding caffeine and alcohol,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.980]   certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime,
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.540]   but I would say in the eight to 12 hours prior to bedtime
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.540]   would be even better.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.860]   We're not drinking alcohol at all,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.320]   or I know there are people out there
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.500]   that don't drink caffeine at all.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.680]   I'm not one of those people,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.000]   but restricting that caffeine intake
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.980]   to the very early part of the day,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.860]   that has been shown to improve the quality
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.600]   and the overall architecture of sleep
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.220]   and slow wave sleep in particular.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.820]   That's really what this study points to.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.320]   There's another tool that can improve the amount
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.060]   and quality of slow wave sleep that you achieve at night.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.480]   This is actually a tool that I've started using
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.320]   over the last six to eight months or so.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.400]   As many of you know,
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.360]   I believe in getting behaviors right
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.480]   before embracing changes in supplementation
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.120]   or prescription drugs.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.680]   Behavioral tools consist of do's and don'ts,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.440]   and the do's and don'ts for sleep are well-documented
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.280]   in the master sleep episode
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.520]   and the perfect your sleep episode
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.480]   and the toolkit for sleep.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.200]   They include getting morning sunlight in your eyes
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.240]   or bright light of other kinds,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.020]   avoiding bright light from 10 PM to 4 AM, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.180]   All that information is in the toolkit for sleep
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.000]   and those other full length episodes
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.820]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.720]   Now, there are supplements that can greatly improve
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.660]   the depth of your sleep
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.000]   and that can shorten the latency to fall asleep.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.660]   And here, I'm not referring to melatonin.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.280]   As many of you perhaps already know,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.940]   I'm not a fan of melatonin for a variety of reasons,
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.320]   mainly the fact that most melatonin supplements out there
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.980]   don't actually contain the exact amount of melatonin
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.940]   that's listed on the bottle.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.120]   They contain either much, much more or much, much less.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.620]   And that melatonin is a potent hormone
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.240]   that has impacts on not just sleep,
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.380]   but on other hormone systems as well.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.560]   The supplements that I've suggested
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.960]   and that I personally take in order to improve my sleep
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   are magnesium threonate, spelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.900]   And interchangeably with that,
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.900]   one could use magnesium bisglycinate.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.260]   I do consider those interchangeable
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.340]   because both cross into cells
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.020]   and across the blood brain barrier in much the same way
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.780]   that makes them better candidates for improving sleep
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.860]   than some of the other forms of magnesium.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.860]   So magnesium threonate, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.660]   theanine, and something called apigenin,
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.940]   which is essentially what you find in chamomile
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.940]   that is the reason why chamomile can make you sleepy.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.900]   A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.020]   The dosages for those, et cetera,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.260]   are described in the toolkit for sleep
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.300]   and why some people might want to avoid theanine.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.140]   I'll just tell you,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.060]   for those of you that have very intense dreams
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.540]   or that might sleepwalk or have night terrors,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.780]   you might want to avoid theanine
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.820]   because it can enhance the kind of emotional
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.060]   and elaborate nature of dreams.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060]   Other people like that.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.060]   So I'll take magnesium threonate, theanine, and apigenin
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.800]   as a so-called sleep stack about 30 or 60 minutes
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.400]   prior to sleep.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.360]   I do not take them during the day.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.260]   There is, however, another supplement
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.800]   that used in combination with the sleep stack
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.020]   that I just described or alone
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.820]   can greatly enhance the quality of your sleep.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.420]   And in particular,
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.860]   people who are following a low carbohydrate diet
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.980]   who have trouble falling and staying asleep
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.220]   seem to benefit from it.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.580]   And that is so-called inositol.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.340]   Now inositol comes in different forms,
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.540]   but the form that I'm referring to here
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.180]   in terms of enhancing slow wave sleep is myoinositol.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.260]   There are an enormous number of studies on inositol
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.500]   for sake of mental health
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.140]   and for sake of enhancing various aspects
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.060]   of cellular function and for sake of improving sleep.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.300]   I'd like to just highlight one paper.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.460]   The title of this paper will make it clear what it's about.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.840]   The title of the paper is
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.100]   The Impact of Myoinositol Supplementation
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.740]   on Sleep Quality in Pregnant Women,
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.900]   a Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.980]   Now, as I just told you,
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.180]   the study was carried out on pregnant women,
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.680]   but there have been other studies of inositol
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.380]   on other populations.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.940]   And the major takeaway from these studies
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.580]   is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.380]   and can adjust the architecture of sleep
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.280]   in ways that make it a great candidate
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.000]   for improving the structure
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.200]   and maybe also the duration of slow wave sleep in particular.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.000]   I find that if I'm following a lower carbohydrate diet,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.900]   which I do from time to time,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.840]   I sometimes have trouble falling asleep,
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.320]   or if I eat four to six hours prior to bedtime,
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.280]   then I tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.740]   And sometimes if I'm exercising very hard
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.640]   or if I'm working a lot,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.380]   even if I eat dinner around seven
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.460]   and I go to sleep around 10 p.m.,
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.800]   I might be a little bit hungry still at 10 p.m.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.420]   In that case, I find that taking 900 milligrams
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.980]   of myo-inositol in addition to the other sleep stack
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.980]   that I just described greatly enhances my ability
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.020]   to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.140]   I do monitor my sleep.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.200]   I do that two ways.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.640]   I do that these days with my eight sleep sleep tracker,
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.380]   and I use a whoop sleep tracker when I sleep.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.100]   The combination of those two
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.820]   taps into different aspects of sleep tracking,
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.900]   heart rate variability, movement, et cetera.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.420]   In a future episode, we'll talk about
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   what are the best devices for monitoring sleep,
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.860]   which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.420]   But I certainly see it in the objective data,
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.500]   that is from the sleep tracking data.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.700]   And I also observed subjectively
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.420]   that taking 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep,
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.520]   again, 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep,
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.880]   can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.560]   and for me to stay asleep throughout the night.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.840]   I also noticed another effect,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.500]   which is that if I wake up in the middle of the night
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.360]   to use the restroom, which I often do,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.000]   I find it much easier to fall back asleep.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.100]   I don't tend to get into kind of looping thought
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.900]   and things of that sort in the middle of the night.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.860]   And that may relate to the fact that
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.340]   my inositol has been studied in many cases
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.160]   for its role in controlling anxiety,
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.660]   that is for reducing anxiety.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.540]   And that's one of the reasons,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.780]   in fact, one of many reasons
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.480]   why people take my inositol during the daytime.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.580]   There's studies of my inositol for dealing with anxiety,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.700]   for sleep as we're discussing now,
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.420]   and even for improving fertility
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.980]   and things of that sort, in particular in women.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.260]   So again, 900 milligrams of inositol can be a useful tool.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.100]   60 minutes of exercise as described previously
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.080]   can be a tool.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.900]   And certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.280]   is an excellent tool for enhancing
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.460]   the total amount of slow wave sleep.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.780]   Jack had a second part to his question.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.000]   He asked, is having a high level of rapid eye movement sleep
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.560]   and a lower level of deep sleep
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.660]   likely to cause any health issues?
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.860]   And to be honest, it's not really clear
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.320]   that it would cause any specific health issues.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.440]   Although if we think about what the specific roles
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.860]   of slow wave sleep versus rapid eye movement sleep are,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.700]   again, rapid eye movement sleep
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.620]   being laden with highly emotional dreams,
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.260]   it's thought to act as a sort of a trauma release
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.440]   where people are paralyzed in body,
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.900]   and that's a healthy paralysis,
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.740]   this so-called sleep atonia,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.500]   but undergoing some pretty emotional stuff
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.020]   within their dreams.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.420]   And there is a lack of ability for the body
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.740]   to secrete adrenaline during rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.620]   That's thought to be important for emotional repair,
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.420]   if you will, during the night.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.520]   Certainly studies where people have been deprived
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.600]   of rapid eye movement sleep have shown
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.820]   that their ability to manage emotionally
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.060]   during the daytime is reduced.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.700]   So certainly if you have reduced rapid eye movement sleep
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   for multiple nights, that's going to be the case.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.740]   The only caveat to that is that there are certain forms
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.860]   of treating depression that involve specifically depriving
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.540]   people of rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.340]   That's a whole other story that was covered
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.860]   in the podcast episode with Dr. Nolan Williams.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.060]   So if you want to learn more as to why that's the case,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.580]   check out that episode.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.860]   But because slow wave sleep,
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.840]   which occurs again during the early part of the night,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.060]   is when growth hormone is released,
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.440]   and when there's this periodic washout of debris
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.680]   within the brain, and to some extent,
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.460]   within certain tissues of the body,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.580]   you could imagine that reduced slow wave sleep
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.160]   would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.420]   from injury, maybe even relate to the immune system.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.860]   However, I am personally not aware of any studies
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.700]   that specifically looked at the ratio of slow wave sleep
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.420]   to rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.300]   and that focused in particular on reduced slow wave sleep
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.200]   for bodily repair.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.280]   Those studies might be out there.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.380]   I was not able to find them.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.260]   If you are able to find them,
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.440]   please put them in the comment section,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.560]   and I would love to check out those studies.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.800]   So I don't think that one needs to be overly concerned
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.560]   if you're not getting a balance of slow wave sleep
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.800]   to rapid eye movement sleep, that's perfect.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.940]   However, and as I mentioned earlier,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.760]   it would be good to strive to try and balance
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.160]   the amount of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.720]   across the entire night.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.320]   If you think about it, that will also tell you
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.000]   whether or not you're getting sufficient total sleep.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.600]   And I don't want to open up another set of questions here
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.280]   as I'm about to close out an answer to this question,
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.960]   but I do often get asked the question
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.820]   whether or not four hours is enough,
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.720]   or six hours is enough, or eight hours is enough.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.640]   Well, it's impossible to know exactly
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.100]   how much sleep each individual person needs.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.200]   And of course, each individual person
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.640]   will need a different amount of total sleep
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.680]   depending on the amount of stress and physical strain
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.580]   and various other things they're dealing with
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.280]   in their daily waking life.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.100]   However, it's generally the case that kids and people
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.560]   that are undergoing puberty and certainly in early infancy
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.160]   need more sleep than adults do.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   So as you age, you do in fact need less sleep.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.940]   One good metric of whether or not
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.480]   you are getting enough sleep is whether or not
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.200]   you're sleepy during the daytime or not.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.960]   If you're falling asleep a lot during the daytime,
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.600]   you're probably not getting enough sleep at night.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   That's sort of a duh, but it's an important duh
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.840]   to pay attention to.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.520]   And for those of us like myself
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.200]   that need a 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon, great.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.060]   That doesn't necessarily mean
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.780]   you're not getting enough sleep at night, okay?
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.920]   So if you get sleepy enough
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.160]   to want to nap in the afternoon,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.180]   that's not an indication necessarily
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.680]   that you are not getting enough sleep at night.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.860]   However, if you're only sleeping
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.900]   four or five hours per night,
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.760]   it's very hard to imagine that you're getting a balance
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.500]   of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.780]   Once you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.700]   and certainly eight to 10 hours per night,
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.840]   the probability that you're getting a balance
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.780]   of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.500]   greatly increases.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.020]   So if I were to throw out a number,
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.400]   I would say for most people, that is for 95% of people
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.160]   out there getting at least six hours of sleep per night
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.020]   at least and ideally more like seven or eight
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.040]   is going to be the goal.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.360]   However, I've noticed for instance for myself,
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.340]   unless I'm exercising extremely intensely
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.360]   or I'm going through a lot of emotional
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.140]   or physical stress in my daily life,
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.400]   getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.620]   allows me to feel really good and refreshed
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.780]   throughout the day.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.440]   And that's especially the case
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.600]   if I get that 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.360]   or use an SDR, non-sleep deep rest.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.240]   So I hope that answers your question, Jack.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.860]   And there, of course, I'm extending the answer
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.240]   to all others who upvoted that question
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.000]   or who might be interested in improving
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.400]   their slow wave sleep.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.720]   There are some dos, there are some don'ts
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.900]   that I just described.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.320]   I suggest trying various things one by one
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.000]   to see what works best for you.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.460]   So you don't necessarily need to leap
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.920]   to doing the 60 minutes of exercise
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.360]   plus the inositol, et cetera.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.720]   However, I do encourage everyone to avoid alcohol
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.260]   and caffeine within the eight to 12 hours prior to sleep.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.440]   And again, if you're not using either of those,
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.400]   that would be even better
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.720]   at least in terms of sleep architecture.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.560]   Thank you for joining
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.240]   for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.600]   to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.240]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.480]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.720]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.320]   standard channel and premium tools
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.720]   not released anywhere else,
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.840]   please go to Hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.060]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.280]   the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.140]   it's really twofold.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.040]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.540]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.800]   which of course will still be continued
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.260]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.660]   We are not going to change the format
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.240]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.680]   and to fund research,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.720]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.800]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.600]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.800]   that we are most interested in.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.420]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.460]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.360]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.760]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.480]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.760]   and other media channels.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.360]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.560]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.720]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.480]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   in the first place.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.820]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.760]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.400]   to do a dollar for dollar match
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.320]   on all funds raised for research
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.040]   through the premium channel.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.660]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.620]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.120]   to further support research
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.720]   for science and science related tools
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.980]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.820]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.600]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.660]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.420]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.760]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.660]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.220]   and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.620]   that other people ask as well.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.560]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.360]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.280]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.500]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.820]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.180]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.580]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.260]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.140]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.020]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.180]   (upbeat music)
