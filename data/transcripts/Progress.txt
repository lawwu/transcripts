[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Hello everybody, how's everyone doing? It's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.640]   episode I want to catch up on a lot of things and a lot of good things that I've
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.000]   been seeing since the last episode. You know the stock market has rallied
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.960]   significantly from its bottom so it's looking so far that buying equities
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.200]   below $2400 on the S&P is a good move. You're up you know 15 to 27%
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   depending on where you bought and also it looks like people are getting their
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.440]   stimulus checks of $1,200 per person if you make under $75,000 you get that full
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.840]   amount. $2,400 if you're a couple and you make under $150,000 and $500 per child.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.640]   So there are people who are getting $2,400 plus $500, $2,900 and $3,400 and
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.600]   even more and that's finally hitting the bank out in mid-April. Further you're
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.480]   seeing small business owners which make up 99 plus percent of all businesses in
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.960]   America who also employ about 48% of all working Americans in America start to
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.720]   get their Paycheck Protection Program loans funded. Now it's really still quite
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.840]   slow given they were allowed to apply on what April 3rd and it's April 16th.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.280]   Still a minority of applications have got their PPP funding and also the PPP
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.680]   funding of $350 billion has temporarily run out because there's a roadblock in
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.320]   Congress but expect that money to continue to go through. However I think
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.960]   all the loans will go through because politicians want power and they need to
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.120]   get re-elected. So all these businesses, 99% of all businesses, should get eight
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.880]   weeks of payroll paid for and that money will be forgiven if they keep their
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   employees as is on their payroll with the same type of salaries. And then you
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.480]   look further down the line those people who unfortunately lost their jobs so
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.240]   something like 22 million unemployment claims by April 16th 2020. I mean that's
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.560]   a crazy amount. However the government is offering $600 extra unemployment
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.960]   benefits for weeks. I think up to 39 weeks which is not as high as the 99
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.600]   weeks during the 2008-2009 financial crisis but still it's a pretty good
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   amount. Here in California you can earn $4,200 in unemployment benefits per
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.480]   person and if you have a dual unemployed household that's $8,400 a month and
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.960]   that's $100,800 a year. I think most of us most of us can provide for
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   ourselves for $4,200 a month at least food and shelter and just the random
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.400]   basic necessities so that's really great. And even illegal immigrants here in
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   California are getting I think $500 from a $125 million fund provided by
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.360]   taxpayers and private citizens. Say what you will I think if you're a productive
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.040]   member of society you should probably get some type of relief given everybody
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   is getting some type of relief. So a lot has been going on I've gotten a lot of
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.840]   questions I just want to do a quick Q&A here. So the most common question I get
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   is are you buying into the stock market rally and my answer is no I am not
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.600]   buying any more equities with the S&P 500 above was like $2,750 right now. I was
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.000]   buying all the way down to about $2,300 and I've stopped because I fully
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.800]   fulfilled my goal of boosting my equity exposure from 20% of net worth to
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.880]   25% of net worth. In fact I've been trimming some equity positions that I
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.040]   bought earlier and reallocated some of my municipal bond funds into paying down
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.440]   some mortgage debt. I mean this is a crazy violent quick rally just like it
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.560]   was a crazy violent sell-off. I mean there are symmetries to that but you've
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.320]   got to believe that there's gonna be some hiccups on the way. You know the
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.040]   market always discounts the future and that's why you know coming up with a
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.440]   framework and saying okay where do you think earnings are gonna go and then
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.960]   coming up with that stock market bottom post that I wrote I think was a way to
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.920]   help people think about earnings and now we're gonna go into first quarter
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.160]   earnings and you know they're not gonna be good but hopefully we expected this
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   but the real X factor is the second quarter and it's probably not gonna
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   happen where we're gonna go straight up right back to $3,200 $3,300 we're gonna
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.360]   see a lot of false starts we're gonna see some problems we might see some
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.440]   reactivation in cases that we're seeing in South Korea and maybe in China. Who
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.320]   knows but you've got this second chance to reallocate your risk assets to be
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.960]   appropriate with your risk tolerance. I mean just think about all the noise and
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.120]   the doom and gloom they were hearing when you know the Dow was below $20,000
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.760]   and the S&P 500 was below $2,300 I mean people were talking about going 50% 70%
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.880]   lower greatest pain affliction ever in the history of mankind all that stuff
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.920]   and here we are much much much higher so if you were just freaking out at way
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.240]   lower levels you have a chance to right that ship and make sure your risk
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.520]   exposure matches your risk tolerance. Second question have your thoughts about
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.120]   a second half v-shaped recovery change? Largely no, largely no. Maybe we're gonna
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.920]   have more of a swoosh shape recovery but I still think there's gonna be a pretty
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.720]   solid recovery because this is a self-inflicted wound. I believe portions
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.800]   of our economy will start opening up in May and in June. I believe that we're
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.480]   gonna learn to live with the virus in our day-to-day lives we're just gonna
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.400]   make a lot more adjustments. I believe handshakes will be down, face mask usage
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.560]   will be up, there's gonna be a quota system for how many people can enter a
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.120]   store and so forth but we're gonna get things done and I think now we are much
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.560]   safer from the coronavirus than we were back in March because of all these
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.400]   lockdowns that we've been doing for the past three four weeks. I do believe the
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.160]   government will do everything possible to try to keep afloat as many
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.640]   Americans as possible and therefore if the lockdowns end in May or June and
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.200]   everybody gets their PPP loans and their stimulus checks and their
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.920]   unemployment benefits I think things will inevitably resume and I think
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.240]   you're seeing that in the stock market in a reflection that the curve is
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.400]   flatter than expected, less people are getting the virus as the model is
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.520]   expected and so forth. Next question I get is are you making any changes with
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.680]   your finances? Well I do like to review my cash position every day because it
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.360]   feels so good to see that cash and you just tell yourself ah nothing can take
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.320]   away from the cash but I'm readying my cash just in case there is an
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.960]   opportunity in the real estate market so I want to find that real estate seller
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:15.280]   who is the stock seller who's panic sold at Dow 18,600 and the S&P 500 at
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.480]   2250. I think they are out there and you need cash to take advantage and you need
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   to look to take advantage so that's one thing I'm doing. The second thing I'm
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.800]   doing is trying to replenish my cash because I spent about 90% of my cash
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.960]   buying equities on the way down and of course I didn't bottom ticket because I
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.200]   had multiple multiple tranches but I did use 90% of my cash and it feels good to
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.680]   have more cash during uncertain times. The other funny thing I'm doing which
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.160]   probably is irrelevant to most of you is I'm looking for personal finance sites
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.440]   to buy because what this pandemic has taught me is that hmm having an online
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:59.240]   media business no matter how small can actually be quite defensive and quite
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.520]   attractive because the government can't force me or any website owner to shut
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.240]   down their website. Yeah revenue could be down, business could be down but so long
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.600]   as you can keep on operating you can find a way. So again I think if there are
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.920]   people who over levered or just spend too much I don't know I think there's
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.360]   opportunity. I really do believe there's only a two to three month opportunity
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.800]   where there is tremendous value that can be had. For example when Silver Lake and
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.680]   Sixth Street Partners decided to invest 1 billion in Airbnb with a 10% interest
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.880]   rate and warrants that convert to an 18 billion valuation that's gonna be the
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.080]   stuff of legends folks I think in a couple years because Airbnb was valued
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.160]   at about it's like 40 something billion during the 2017 round and was expected
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.880]   to go public for 50 plus billion in 2020. So if you can get those type of terms I
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.040]   think in two three years when things normalize people are going to be talking
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.760]   about this deal and I think if you can aggressively hunt right now for deals
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.480]   whether it's in real estate or in private websites or just anything that
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.800]   you know you think could be at risk I think now is the time. We've already had
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.360]   our chance buying stocks they move so quickly and you've seen a massive
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.240]   rebound it's time to see if there's any laggard risk assets out there that may
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.840]   be very attractively valued. So overall I hope all of us are a little bit more
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.640]   hopeful than we were a month ago and there are a lot of positives as I've
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.360]   discussed in this podcast and there are a lot more positives that I haven't
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.800]   discussed such as healing your body from the grind of work, spending more time
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.600]   with your children, letting the earth heal a little bit more, less pollution
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.240]   and so forth. But again I am very optimistic in general as a person so of
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.200]   course take my view with a grain of salt and if you want a good dose of reality
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.600]   and negativity and all that just turn on the news or just go on social media or
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.400]   wherever you get your news. I'm personally going to reduce the amount of
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.200]   social media consumption and news consumption because I felt that it
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.160]   really weighed me down in the first quarter and I did write a first quarter
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.520]   2020 recap entitled "The Most Brutal But Beautiful Quarter" and it was brutal
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.960]   obviously for all these reasons such as the lockdown and the fears of the virus
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   and so forth but it was beautiful because I got to spend time with my
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.120]   family. And feel free to read the post and comment and share your thoughts and
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.760]   going forward I'm just going to continue to do what I've been doing for you guys
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.040]   and that is to write and to occasionally record and to share my thoughts about
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.600]   what's happening. So far I think we're heading in the right direction and if
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.560]   we're not I'm going to definitely tell you so stay tuned, stick around, be
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.960]   healthy, be happy, be loved, be hopeful, be safe and just keep on going. We're
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.880]   right in the thick of things that every day that goes by is one less day that we
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.480]   have to go through pain and I think things will get better and they are
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.560]   getting better. Take care, everyone.
