[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai, and it is August 14, 2019.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.160]   And just wanted to talk about the inverted yield curve, which we are now experiencing.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.840]   The 10-year bond yield is now lower than the 2-year bond yield, and that means an official
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.560]   inversion.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.640]   And the 10-year bond yield has been below the 3-month bond yield and the 1-month bond
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.800]   yield for a while now, which could also mean inversion, but the classic definition of inversion
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.200]   is the 10-year below the 2-year.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.520]   But at any rate, the yield curve has been flat inverted for a year, year and a half
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   now.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.040]   And it's also interesting to note that if you look at history, whenever the yield curve,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.520]   the official definition of the yield curve inverts, 10-year and 2-year, a recession comes
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.920]   in 6 to 18 months.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.120]   So if you've been wondering what's going on with the housing market, where volume is low
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.960]   and prices aren't rocketing higher, it might be because a lot of consumers are thinking
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.440]   this is it.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.720]   2018 was a scare when median property prices fell up to like 10 plus percent in many markets
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.020]   from the first quarter 2018 to the end of 2018.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.820]   And people are just wondering, hmm, maybe we shouldn't be buying right now.
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.640]   And maybe there is pent up demand actually as well, because rates, mortgage rates are
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.600]   down at least 1%, if not more like 1.25% from 2018.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.620]   And that should increase buying power and increase demand for property.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.300]   But we're not seeing that just yet because I think people are just taking a wait and
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.460]   see approach.
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.420]   Because again, fourth quarter 2018 was pretty, pretty bad.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.940]   The market sold off like 15 plus percent.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.840]   So I just wanted to talk about the inversion again, because we talked about this before
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.720]   and it's good to get an idea of what's going on.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.100]   So the way to understand the yield curve is to look at it from different perspectives.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.300]   So from the lender's perspective, due to inflation, the value of a dollar tomorrow is worth less
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.100]   than the value of a dollar today.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.300]   So therefore, in order to profitably lend money, you must charge an interest rate.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.020]   The longer the lending term, the higher the interest you should charge, hence the upward
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.140]   slope of the yield curve.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.900]   If the borrower has poor credit score, runs an unstable business, has large job gaps in
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.900]   his or her resume, doesn't read Financial Samurai or listen to Financial Samurai, you're
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.820]   going to have to charge a higher rate.
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.860]   And it's pretty logical.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.000]   So if you are a bank, your main source of funding is from savings deposits.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.620]   For the privilege of holding such deposits, you pay customers an interest rate and hope
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.420]   to lend out their deposits at a higher interest rate for a positive net interest margin.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.140]   This is the classic way banks do business.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.140]   It's been going on for a century plus, and that's how the yield curve is upward sloping.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.540]   So from a borrower's perspective, it's a little bit opposite here.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.020]   A rational borrower is incentivized to borrow as much money as possible for as long of a
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.900]   period as possible at the lowest interest rate possible to hopefully get rich.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.720]   The more you borrow, the more you will likely invest.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.940]   And when the borrowing rate is equal to or below the inflation rate, a borrower is essentially
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.500]   getting a free loan.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.700]   So the classic borrower example is the homebuyer.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.820]   After putting about 20% down on average, the buyer borrows the remaining 80%.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.360]   The lower the interest rate, the more inclined the borrower is to take on more debt to buy
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.660]   a bigger, fancier house.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.460]   So for people looking to buy property right now, it's a good time to look.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.740]   Although down cycles in the property market can last 3-5 years on average, looking now
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.980]   when inventory is higher and rates are lower is a much better time than looking last year.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.740]   So when homebuyers want to stretch, they take out an adjustable rate mortgage with lower
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.720]   interest rates versus 30 year fixed and so forth.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.260]   In addition to homebuyers, there are companies large and small that borrow money to grow
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.180]   their respective businesses.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.620]   If interest rates are lower at every duration, businesses will tend to borrow more, invest
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.380]   more, hire more, and consequently boost GDP growth.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.560]   So the equation for GDP equals consumer spending plus investment plus government spending plus
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.460]   net exports.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.540]   That's GDP growth.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.780]   And then from the investor's perspective, given the motivations of the borrower and
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.220]   the lender, the investor sees the yield curve as an economic indicator.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.320]   The steeper the yield curve up to a point, the healthier the economy.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.900]   The flatter the yield curve, the more cause for concern given the borrower's doubt about
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.740]   the near future.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.340]   So right now, you are seeing the 10 year bond yield at about 1.6%, whereas the 2 year bond
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:11.960]   yield is about 1.65%, and the 1 month bond yield is about 2.15%.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.100]   So it's pretty inverted right now.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.700]   So with such an inverted yield curve, if you're the bank, you're disinclined to lend money
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.260]   over a long duration because the return is too low relative to the short end.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.580]   You are paying higher deposit rates, so you're getting squeezed there because it costs more,
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.380]   and then you're getting less in profits because you're lending for a long term at a lower
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.380]   rate.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.380]   So what happens?
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.020]   You just stop lending as much, and you also tighten lending standards.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.620]   And from the borrower's perspective, you're just hoarding cash because the future doesn't
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.620]   look very bright.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.820]   It's very uncertain.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.980]   But the short term, you're getting 2.1% to 2.3% interest rate on your cash.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.460]   It's risk-free up to $250,000 for the FDIC.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.860]   And so the logical conclusion is that you hoard cash, and you wait.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.140]   You don't invest in the future.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.140]   And what happens?
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.140]   What happens?
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.500]   Well, the velocity of money that turns and turns around in the economy slows down.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.040]   And when that slows down, economic growth slows down.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.620]   And that is why we've seen historically whenever the yield curve inverts, a recession is 6
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.700]   to 18 months away.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.780]   And if you look at history, just look at history, look at the post, look at some charts, 1989,
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.620]   '88, the yield curve inverted.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.740]   A recession came in 1991.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.260]   If you look at 1999, the yield curve inverted.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.620]   A recession came in 2000.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.780]   If you look at 2007, the yield curve inverted.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.980]   There was a recession, big one, obviously, in 2008, 2009.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.680]   So I really don't think this time is different.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.180]   Investing is rational long term.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.180]   Investors take action to enrich themselves while doing their best to avoid actions that
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.180]   will make them poor.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.100]   If I want six-pack abs, I'm going to drink water every day and only eat celery and do
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.980]   1,000 sit-ups, and then I'm rationally going to get six-pack abs and kind of not feel so
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.260]   good because I'm starving.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.740]   And everything else long term is very rational.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.340]   Short term, kind of irrational, right?
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.660]   Like when the Fed raised rates in December 2018 when the yield curve was already flat,
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.940]   it's just dumb.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.660]   And so they reversed course, right, seven and a half months later.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   But they're just dumb.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.360]   There's like short-term irrational noise, everything.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.880]   But long term, you've got to think rationally.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.740]   And so on your road to financial independence, your goal is to not lose massive money because
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.920]   not only does losing massive money hurt.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.780]   It takes away time and time becomes more and more valuable.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.060]   Again, if you lose 50% of your money, you've got to get 100% return just to get to even.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.940]   And worse is that it probably will take you several years of work and saving and investing
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.520]   to get back to even.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.740]   And you don't want that.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.480]   You just don't want that.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.520]   So everybody right now needs to take advantage of short-term rates.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.420]   You're getting 2% to 2.5%.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.220]   Some banks are subsidizing the consumer by paying higher rates to get more deposits.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.780]   But most banks are not.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.900]   They're going to cut rates now because the Fed has started cutting rates.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.900]   So you get it.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.160]   Hoard cash.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.880]   You have got to refinance your mortgage.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.860]   You want to refinance into the sweet spot of the yield curve.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.380]   So we're talking seven-year and 10-year arms.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.940]   That is the sweet spot where you get the most bang for your buck.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.140]   That's good duration.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.740]   The average homeowner only owns his or her home for about eight to nine years.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.980]   So if you're refinancing seven- to 10-year fix, that is pretty sweet.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.020]   And you probably also want to look at real estate.
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.420]   Real estate right now is a little bit soft because inventory is piling up in a lot of
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.420]   these big cities.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.620]   It's a boom-bust cycle.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.620]   But you don't have to pay the market rate right now.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   You should look.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.380]   You should see what's out there.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.620]   And you should lowball, especially stale fish listings where the broker just simply missed
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.260]   price and it's been on the market for months, maybe years.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.500]   That to me is pretty interesting.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.620]   And especially since you're going to save about one to one and a quarter percent on
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.820]   your mortgage if you've got to take a mortgage, that's pretty rational to me.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.140]   So I hope everybody is paying attention.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.820]   If you've got a day job, be nice to your boss and colleagues because during recessions,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.820]   people who are not nice are also the first ones to go.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.180]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.660]   Stay safe out there.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.820]   And if you like this podcast, please leave a positive review.
