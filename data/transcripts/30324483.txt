[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.240]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.880]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.560]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.800]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.280]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.040]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.560]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.920]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.000]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.720]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.560]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.560]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.800]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.240]   Well, listeners, I have a treat in store for you today.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.320]   I have with me Lee Bortons,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   founder of Classical Conversations,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.240]   but what I want to talk to her specifically about today
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.100]   is something that I suspect you are all interested in also.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.000]   Probably you've been hearing rustlings and rumors
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.520]   and whisperings about Classical Conversations'
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.680]   new math curriculum called The Math Map.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.200]   And so I have Lee today who is gonna share with us
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.680]   how she got started building The Math Map,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   what the vision for it was,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.320]   how it's gonna bless families.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.680]   And I'll tell you guys,
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.080]   every time I hear Lee talk about The Math Map,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.600]   it makes me wish my kids were young enough
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.320]   to teach math to again.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   But the good news for me
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.720]   is that I have grandchildren coming up
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.800]   and I'm going to learn along with them
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.360]   how to have better math conversations
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.440]   than I ever had with my own kids.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.280]   So Lee, I want you to know you have inspired me already.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.480]   - Oh, well, thank you, Lisa.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.640]   I'm so glad you're an inspiration to me too.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.560]   And I've really enjoyed both our friendship
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.800]   and our deep academic conversations over these years
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.880]   of homeschooling and helping others to know God
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.960]   and make Him known through their family life.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.600]   So thanks for this podcast that you do regularly.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.320]   - I am excited to have you today.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.360]   And I know that we could talk about 1,000 different things
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840]   and chase 1,000 different rabbits down all kinds of trails.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.960]   So I'm gonna try to get us to talk about
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.120]   your vision for classical home-centered education
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.000]   and specifically about The Math Map.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.280]   Listen, I know that the metaphor of a journey
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.000]   has kind of been the hallmark of CC for years and years.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.920]   How has homeschooling or how was and how is
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.680]   homeschooling a journey for you?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.840]   - Yeah, you know, I like to travel a lot
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.000]   and I think it's just a really great analogy
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.040]   for life, the journey,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.760]   and for any of the endeavors that you embark upon.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.520]   I think about how very often as a mom, I was lost
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.680]   and I needed something to guide me back.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.920]   And of course, that's always family and friends
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160]   and the scriptures, our church.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.200]   But for me, it's always been,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.120]   an additional resource has been the books I love
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.120]   and the classical conversations of history.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.480]   And so there's been so many ways to get back on track
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.640]   when you feel like you don't know where you're going.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.880]   It's also been a journey because the travel,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.600]   always there's surprise.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.080]   Some of my best trips are ones where we've just gotten
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.960]   in the car in a new country and had no GPS
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.400]   and said, let's just see what we find
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.920]   someone interesting to talk to, right?
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.600]   So people make the difference.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.080]   People ask me all the time when I travel,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.480]   what's the best thing about traveling?
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   It's one thing only, the people.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.800]   That's what makes it, makes anything what it is.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.160]   So with The Math Map and homeschooling
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.080]   and all our curriculum development,
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.960]   the whole reason we do it in community
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.480]   is because it doesn't really matter the resource
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.000]   as much as the people around you
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   and working together towards a similar goal.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   So that's one of the reasons we put The Math Map together
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   was so that we could have total intellectual property
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   available for training and events and programs and camps
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.520]   and whatever we wanted to do so that we as a community
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.120]   could work together whenever we felt loss.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.840]   We didn't have to go to an online system.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.960]   Most of us don't know a mathematician
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.040]   that we're friends with to ask questions.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.680]   But here, working together through The Math Map
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.760]   and Classical Conversations Communities,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.240]   we can actually do something I think extraordinary,
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   which is build the reputation that Christians
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.800]   love studying math to know God and make Him known,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.160]   but we will never do it alone.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.640]   We got to find each other.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.880]   - I, there's so much in what you just said
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   that I've just, my brain was firing
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.560]   in a thousand different directions.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.480]   But my favorite part about what you just said
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.800]   was the emphasis on community.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.480]   And I will tell you, Lee, something that has blessed me
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   and blessed my family for all of the years
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   that I've known you and that we've been involved
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.720]   with this program is that whole idea of community.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.480]   Listeners, it comes from the top.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   The whole idea that homeschooling classical Christian
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.160]   within community, that came from Lee's heart
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.520]   and Lee's mind, and that's still what sets CC apart,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.720]   I think, is the community.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.280]   And that whole idea that you just said
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.560]   that we are all on a journey of discovery about the world,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.400]   and we're gonna talk about the discovery of math today,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.280]   but we are all on a discovery.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   But the best part about the journey may very well be
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.320]   the people that you surround yourself with
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.440]   and the people that you find on the way.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.080]   And I, you know, Lee, I think it's because God created us
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.480]   to live in community that that really meets
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.160]   our heart needs so well.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.040]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.000]   I mean, he uses the body as one of the many analogies
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.880]   of how the church is supposed to be with each other.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   Recently, I've been having conversations
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.880]   with classical leaders about how educational community
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   and church community, any kind of community,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.160]   can be like an orchestra
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.200]   where we're all playing the same instrument.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.480]   I mean, same symphony, but we all have different instruments.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.400]   And so, you know, Jesus said we're the same body,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.680]   but we all have different parts.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.440]   And there's just a lot of different analogies
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.320]   of things that are successful that require people
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.360]   in community to have a vision.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.120]   And of course, the scriptures tell us without vision,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.720]   the people perish.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.040]   So if you don't know where you're going
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.560]   or why you're going, it's trouble in the first place.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.880]   And a lot of educational practices,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   a lot of modern educational practices
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.120]   have been unable to tell us where we were going
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.200]   beyond saying possibly, well, we checked off some credits
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.080]   and my child can get a job.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.520]   And I know my children are gonna live forever.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.080]   So I have a lot bigger vision than that.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.840]   - Oh, that's inspiring.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.520]   That, that, okay, y'all stop a minute and write that down
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.200]   and go back and think about it again.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.400]   Your children are gonna live forever.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   And so your vision of raising them
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   and your vision of educating them
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.680]   needs to grow exponentially in this moment.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.280]   You are educating them for eternity.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.680]   And so the most important thing
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.800]   is that they know how to love God and enjoy Him forever,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.520]   because forever really means forever.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.600]   - I love that, Lee.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.240]   We've, you have mentioned, and I have mentioned maps a lot.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.600]   Have you always been a map reader?
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.400]   Are you a map person or are you a Google directions person?
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.480]   - Well, I'm as modern as anybody else.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.240]   I use Google, I use Google Maps fairly extensively,
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.200]   but I can tell a brief, funny story
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.880]   that I know has happened to every single person
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.560]   who uses it is probably 10 years ago,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.280]   I knew I was following the GPS and I knew it was wrong.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.120]   - Yes, yes.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.480]   - And I said to myself, "Why did you do that?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.400]   "Why did you let the machine be your brain?"
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.040]   So from that moment on, I generally turn it off
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.880]   if I have an inkling of where I'm going,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.040]   and don't turn it on unless I need it,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.200]   because you know what it does
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.480]   is it ruins your situational awareness.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   It used to be before GPS came on, and I did use maps.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.240]   We always had maps in the car,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.800]   but I could tell pretty much where I was
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.440]   by north, south, east, and west by the sun.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.120]   And I also knew pretty much what direction to go on
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.960]   when I was traveling,
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.200]   'cause I understood the numbers of our highway system.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.560]   We had all kinds of clues.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.040]   We didn't need a machine to tell us,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.320]   and so the machine narrows your focus.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.480]   In the same way that thinking math studies
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.240]   is sending your kid to sit in front of a book for an hour
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.480]   quietly in a room by themselves,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   math's everywhere, and it should be part
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.040]   of your daily discussion,
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   and just the increase of situational awareness
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.640]   allows you to see the unseen
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.840]   and start to see how God's creation
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.880]   is mathematical and orderly and glorifies Him,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.600]   that everything about Christendom tells us to look up.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.840]   And sure, we need to be quiet and look down and meditate
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.480]   and have that quiet Bible time
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.520]   and all those kinds of things
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.680]   that a good church experience
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.400]   and a good Christian community will give you,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.200]   but if you're doing it all by yourself
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.880]   and you're not hearing the call of God
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.720]   to go serve others, to be part of the body,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.760]   you're missing the main point.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.200]   And the same with math studies or literature studies
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.160]   or whatever, it doesn't matter what it is.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   I was that 12-year-old, I'm sure you were too, Lisa,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.760]   where I could have spent 10, 12 hours a day in a book
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   and been totally happy. - Yes, and be completely happy.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.520]   - Yeah, and we know, and we had good mothers,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.800]   they knew that wasn't good for us,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.760]   so they said, "Go outside, I'm locking the door."
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.080]   (both laughing)
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.560]   - Yes, yes. - Because they knew
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.880]   that that was not best for us.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.240]   And so now, of course, the whole world's gotten narrowed
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.040]   even more to this little four by,
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.760]   or actually two and a half by six--
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.600]   - Screen, yes. - Screen, right?
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.160]   And so, you know, the medium's the message,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.600]   and so we're teaching children
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.200]   that their main educator is a plastic box.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.800]   - Oh, it's so disheartening.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.640]   - Yeah, so we have all of creation
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.600]   and all of the community the Lord's given us
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.080]   and the resources and talents
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.360]   as individual members of the body.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.760]   There's just so many ways to learn things.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.720]   And at NCC, in community, I know what I know because of you
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   and the hundreds of other women I have hung out with
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.680]   all these years. - Yes, yes.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.240]   I absolutely feel that.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.040]   I absolutely feel like there are things
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.000]   that I understand much better
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.640]   because I had a conversation with some of y'all about that.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.720]   And we discovered things from each other along the way,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.680]   and so we were all better off
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.920]   than we would have been if we had just been sitting,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.960]   reading that book by ourselves
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.280]   or doing that experiment by ourselves.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.320]   Just something about sharing the experience
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.360]   helps us all to grow.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.240]   And I really, really appreciate that.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.120]   And I love what you said about
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.400]   not narrowing our learning to a piece of plastic
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   or a piece of hardware or even,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.960]   and I shudder to say this out loud,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.160]   or even to a book,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.080]   but to go out and experience.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.000]   And one of the things that I absolutely love
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.040]   hearing you talk about the math map
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.520]   is when you talk about,
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.640]   take your math studies into real life.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.480]   Take your math studies outside.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   See where exponential, where exponents are in nature.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.160]   See where shape and pattern and color are in nature.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.440]   And I love that.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.080]   That's a great encouragement
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.160]   to people who, like me,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.800]   were raised with a math textbook
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.520]   and all my math.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.320]   I never did math outside as a kid.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.240]   Now, I did math outside with my kids
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.880]   when I was homeschooling them,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.840]   but math was never...
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.720]   I had one year of pleasant math
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.080]   that I can remember in my whole life, okay?
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.520]   And that was done inside,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.880]   but it was done in color.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.880]   It was a geometry class that I had,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.200]   and the teacher was...
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.600]   And I didn't know it then.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.200]   She was extremely classical.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.400]   She was absolutely adamant
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.040]   that we memorize all of these propositions
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.720]   from the first day of class.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.040]   There were hundreds of them,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   and we had to rewrite them in color
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.680]   and make a fancy notebook.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.480]   And she was super classical,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.400]   and I loved it,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.200]   and I learned so much about it.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   And I could do proofs,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.880]   and I learned later,
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.000]   when I started tutoring logic
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.360]   to challenge B students,
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.080]   I thought, "Why am I able to see this?"
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   And I thought, "Oh my gosh,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.280]   it's that geometry class.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.560]   It's putting together all the grammar."
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.480]   So anyway, that was a huge aside.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   But I just...
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.960]   But it is what makes me appreciate
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.520]   the way that you are leading us
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.680]   to teach math to our children,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.880]   to get outside.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.720]   And I do, though, love the fact
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.440]   that you called the curriculum
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.040]   The Math Map,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.880]   because I think it's really helpful.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.440]   For me, maps are a great way
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.000]   to chart your course,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.840]   to plan.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.640]   You know, if you're going on a long road trip,
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.280]   you can plan your trip,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.960]   and you know, at every juncture,
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.800]   where you are,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.840]   and where you've been,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.480]   and where you're going,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.520]   and how all those roads connect.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.440]   And so that's what I loved
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.000]   when I heard that the curriculum
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.040]   was called The Math Map.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.480]   Why is The Math Map
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.040]   such a good visual,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.280]   and so valuable for us as parents
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.440]   to chart our course?
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.280]   - Yeah, so you and I have enthusiastically
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.600]   talked about almost two extremes of learning.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.040]   One, you mentioned the grammar
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.120]   and what that did to build your memory
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.840]   in a certain way that you could apply elsewhere.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.440]   And you can get grammar from a book.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.960]   And you can do grammar in isolation.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.440]   But the opposite end I talked about,
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.520]   which is seeing the world
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.680]   and knowing what's out there,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.920]   and how to know more of God
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.360]   through creation and his order.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.080]   But parents go, "Okay, I hear you say that.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.040]   "I don't know how to connect the two."
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.600]   And that's what The Math Map does.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.280]   It actually is called that
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.120]   because there truly is order
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.280]   to arithmetic and mathematics studies.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.440]   Everybody says that,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.880]   but very few people can tell you
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.840]   what The Map is.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.560]   So that's the first thing that we did
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.720]   in order to even write the curriculum
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.920]   was seven years ago,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.320]   was to study the history of mathematics
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.000]   and pull together what were the pros and cons
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.440]   of homeschooling and using various kinds
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.680]   of mathematical resources
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.560]   so many of us had used.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.600]   And saying, "But how did that serve the mother?
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.840]   "How did that serve the family?
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.160]   "How did that serve the child?
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.120]   "How did that serve the pocketbook?"
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.480]   Like we took into consideration
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.840]   all those kinds of things
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.200]   when we were putting The Map together
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.360]   and came up with a very orderly set
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.720]   of 30 math concepts that are built
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.080]   on the way God created the universe,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.160]   starting with X and Helio, nothing,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.520]   and going all the way out
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.160]   to multiple dimensions beyond anything
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.600]   our imagination could even comprehend,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.080]   yet even little children could do math
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.640]   that relates to it.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.600]   And so we came up with this path
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   that would make it so that as you attach,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.840]   as you built your memory from flashcards
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.040]   and grammar and calculations,
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.720]   you also could see, okay,
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.160]   this kind of calculation skill fits
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.360]   in with this kind of geometry skill,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.120]   and these two things together fits
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.720]   in with this kind of language skill,
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.120]   and these three things, images, symbols,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.840]   and words fit into the dimensional space
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.160]   that the Lord has given us to live in.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.040]   And it starts to open up the conversation
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.160]   to see how what's in your head,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.240]   your memory work, what's on your paper,
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.720]   the problems you're solving,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.640]   and what, when you look up and out
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.120]   at three-dimensional world, how it all connects.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.760]   And so that's the map.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.600]   It's kind of like you think about the globe
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.640]   has latitude and longitude, same thing,
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.600]   but at each point of the GPS,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.840]   at each point of where latitude
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.120]   and longitude crosses, what's there?
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.960]   What are the pegs that you can put
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.560]   onto that longitude and latitude on the globe?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.920]   It might be a country or a tree.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.600]   - Well, for us in the math map,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.960]   it's generally a concept or an image
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.840]   or a type of equation.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.680]   - Hmm, yes.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.800]   - So it's hard to do, it's hard to explain it
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.200]   without having it in front of you,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.680]   but what we saw was that we needed
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.320]   to have a math curriculum
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.240]   that wasn't just orderly and organized.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.360]   And hey, that means in the long run,
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   it has to be stable 'cause the number one
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   when we publishers make money is new additions.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.480]   And if people wonder why everybody says math is orderly,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.960]   but all the math books are different from each other,
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.240]   it's because one of the ways you can make a new addition
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.280]   is to move chapters around, right?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.000]   And so we won't do that.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.440]   We have a map that can live forever
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.760]   in the sense of children and what they need to know
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.400]   to be prepared to be adult math learners.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.080]   - Oh, that's so good.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.600]   Now, I have been privileged to see
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.080]   a couple of different levels of the math map
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.240]   as they have been piloted and as they are rolling out now.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.720]   And I want you to talk to people
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.320]   who may have just seen a picture of it online
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.720]   or a demonstration or heard somebody
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.960]   in their community talking about it.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.440]   Talk about dimensions and domains,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.720]   how that is the way that the curriculum is organized
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.240]   so that people can understand what in the world
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.920]   those words mean when they get thrown around.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.880]   - That's right.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.960]   So if you think of domains the way
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.000]   moderns think of grade levels, it's almost right.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.560]   The difference would be instead of saying
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.120]   I'm in sixth grade math or I'm in algebra,
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.040]   what we've done in the naming of the curriculum
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.200]   is use the words mathematicians use
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.080]   to describe what they're actually studying in math.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.520]   So your child might be studying naturals
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.720]   or fractions or monomials or expressions
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.760]   and our various grade levels are those domain names
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   because I want my children to not say, oh, I hate algebra.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.200]   I want them to say, you know what?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.120]   I really struggle with fractions
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.240]   or I love those rational numbers
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.760]   or those irrational numbers, those irrational numbers.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.600]   They show God so very well
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.640]   and I can't believe we got to study them
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.760]   in context of zero dimension,
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.200]   which is, you know, he created everything out of.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.520]   Well, I want them to use the right words.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.320]   - So we've got the various domains that go naturals
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.800]   the whole way up through transcendentals,
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.400]   which is our challenge four level
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.520]   because we know that everything on this earth
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.200]   can be transcended in the spiritual world
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.120]   and so that's another,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.720]   just the titles can have spiritual conversations.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.560]   - Right.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.760]   - So those are our domains
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.680]   and so let's say I have a child studying fractions,
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.080]   a little bit older one studying complex numbers
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.600]   and a little bit older one studying binomials.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.440]   - Right.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.800]   - Those words are very familiar to anybody that loves math.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.640]   - Yep.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.480]   - That is good at math, right?
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.320]   - Yep.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.480]   - So the uninitiated, they may not be,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.360]   but they are very common among mathematicians.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.760]   So I've got these three different levels
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.240]   of abilities in my household
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.200]   and look, even if I had two identical twins,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.320]   they're not gonna learn the same way at the same rate,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.560]   the same time in all things.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.680]   - Hardly ever, that's right.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.040]   - Yes, you're always juggling.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.200]   So it doesn't matter,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.440]   like nobody can solve that problem for you.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.000]   You just have to juggle.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.480]   So we developed the curriculum
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.200]   to try to take some of the burden
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.280]   of the juggling off of you.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.520]   So it might be I have triplets
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.880]   and yet they're each using those different domains
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.240]   because one has been able to see more broadly
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.520]   how to use numbers
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.240]   and another one still needs practice on basic numbers.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.680]   But what I can still do to move them all ahead
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.360]   and to keep progress going
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.120]   as well as minimize the responsibilities I have
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.160]   is instead of having three students at three levels
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.160]   doing three different kinds of math
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.640]   and different concepts,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.480]   we all work on the same concept.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.080]   So let me give you a simple example that will resonate.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.840]   So if we're all, as mama,
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.800]   I'm working on addition this week with all the kids.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.400]   So the natural kids are adding two plus three
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.440]   and our fraction students are adding a half and a half
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.840]   and our complex students are adding three i plus four i.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.960]   Our polynomial, by the way I said binomial students
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.960]   are adding two pi plus six to two pi plus seven.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.120]   I'm just adding.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.920]   - Right, so it's the same function.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.800]   It's the same activity.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.120]   - With different domains,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.840]   which is what mathematicians call the types of numbers.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.720]   - Okay, that's easy enough.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   - Well, and so there's no ahead or behind.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.520]   So for instance, myself,
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.640]   if I'm trying to understand a polynomial,
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.080]   I'll make up an addition problem
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.960]   that's maybe uses natural numbers, digits,
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.240]   in order to figure out what's going on with the problem.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.560]   I'll plug that in.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.400]   And then I'll back up and go,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.160]   "Okay, so now there's some letters here."
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.800]   Right, so we're showing the children
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   how to analyze their own work
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.800]   because they understand the only thing that changes
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.920]   is the domain, the operations, or the operations.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.680]   So that makes it easier for whoever the instructing parent is
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.880]   to not have to go learn a number of things,
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.400]   but to say, "Hey, I gotta put some time
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.960]   "into addition this week."
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.800]   Or, "I have to put some time into function analysis."
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   Like whatever it is, integrals, derivatives.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.560]   And so the thing that people have a hard time understanding
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.280]   'cause they've never seen it done before,
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.000]   it's the only thing I can say that's unique to the MathMap
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.680]   is this ability to work on the same concept
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.160]   with all kinds of domains.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.440]   Before I give an example on that, let me back up.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.120]   This isn't, the curriculum itself and its layout
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.720]   and its philosophy is not new.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.480]   For over 2,000 years,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.400]   mathematicians have used Euclidean geometry
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.960]   as the standard for all math studies, and we did too.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.720]   So for those who have historical insight to math,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.040]   they'll recognize how we're using the dimensions.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.560]   So it's just like an aside
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.640]   for those who already know a lot about math.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.000]   Let's talk about something like integrals,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.160]   which is calculus.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.720]   A lot of people don't know what integrals are,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.320]   but they sure want their kid to have a calculus credit
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   'cause somehow that's gonna help 'em be a better Christian.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.120]   So, you know, and here's the thing.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.280]   I actually do think it'd help 'em
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.480]   make 'em be a better Christian,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.640]   but for not the reason they're thinking of.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.680]   - Yes, yes.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.280]   - Cares and money and service,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.320]   and I'm thinking about the mysterious world
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.040]   this Lord has made for us.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.880]   And so what we've done in the MathMap
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.240]   is because it's such good ordered learning
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.520]   is we've demystified some of these harder subjects
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.360]   or concepts.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.680]   So for instance, a lot of people, you know,
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.840]   calculus is scary,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.800]   and they don't remember what integrals are.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.440]   Well, that's probably because no one really showed you
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.400]   what they are.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.680]   Well, if you teach it to a third grader,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.040]   you have to be very clear.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.320]   So what we've done is taken--
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.880]   - And they're not scared of it.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   They don't know it's supposed to be something that's hard.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.720]   - That's true.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.160]   That's absolutely true.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.840]   And because we understand grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.080]   we know what they can do as a young student,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.920]   and we know what they can do as an older student,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.040]   and we don't confuse the two.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.160]   And so for the younger children,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.560]   when they're studying integrals,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.120]   an integral is literally the area under a curve.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.800]   So you can do all kinds of snakes in the air
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.320]   or look at Volkswagen's or the way the tree branches
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.000]   and say, "What's the area under that curve?"
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.680]   It's something that we do all the time intuitively, right?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.880]   You don't go measure the tree
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.680]   before you duck under the bow.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.600]   - Yep.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.520]   - You just feel it.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.280]   You just know the space that's under there.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.200]   So what mathematicians say is,
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.000]   not only can you have that intuition
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.240]   and about the real life use of the space,
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.200]   but there's a math equation that'll model it.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.560]   That's at the higher levels of integrals and calculus.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.120]   But what we'll be doing in the math curriculum,
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.160]   which is that tie between grammar and the real world,
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.760]   is we will be showing children a curve on a graph,
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.200]   kind of like you'd expect in a piece of math curriculum,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.000]   and we'll ask the younger children
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.400]   to count the squares under the curve,
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.720]   to start getting a sense of area.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.960]   We'll ask the middle schoolers to break those curves up
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.920]   into sections of areas underneath.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.160]   So a trapezoid might be a better fit
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.000]   or a triangle might be a better fit
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.240]   rather than squares, which the little kids are using.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.160]   And then eventually we get to the place
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.880]   where we take really narrow columns of, right,
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.480]   long skinny rectangles under the curve.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.000]   And your 12, 13, 14-year-olds add those up.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.360]   So finally, we get to the point
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.920]   where there's actually the integral equation,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.840]   which makes it so that all that work they've been doing,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.880]   counting and coloring and tracing and measuring,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.720]   can just be done in an equation if they would like to.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.080]   But now they'll know what the equation means
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.000]   because we'll have stepped towards that
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.240]   from the very beginning.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.040]   - That is so cool.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   And it will be, the understanding will dawn on them
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.000]   as they grow, and it will be a much more natural way
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.080]   of apprehending a truth that, you know,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   eluded a lot of us in higher math
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.800]   because it didn't have any connection
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.840]   to anything we had ever done,
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.800]   or at least we didn't realize it did
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.120]   'cause nobody drew it out for us.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.760]   - Yeah, I mean, you were getting your work done
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.360]   because you were told to.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.040]   And, you know, people like you and I,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.520]   we probably actually liked our teachers
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.680]   and were happy to get the A,
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.640]   but not everybody's like you and I, right?
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.600]   So we designed a math curriculum
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.680]   that's aimed for that, what I call the 85%.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.880]   'Cause here's the thing,
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.640]   you and I may not have been great at math,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.920]   we might've been in literature, but we were good students.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.840]   And so we knew how to put our minds to something.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.320]   You were in that 5% where we could figure it out
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.920]   good enough to pass the test.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.000]   But that's a skill that can be taught.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.640]   And what's really sad about math education these days,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.560]   it's really meant to be a weed out program
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.720]   to figure out who can go to the state land grant schools
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.320]   and, you know, make amazing new technologies.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.840]   And so the whole point is to make it
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.400]   so that only the best kids do well.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.880]   Well, we targeted our curriculum to that 85%,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   that child who could do a whole lot better
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.520]   if somebody would just show them how.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.400]   And then of course, the children that are
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.120]   not quite at that target,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.480]   they can work in a narrower domain
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.000]   so everybody can be at that 85% level or above.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.720]   But you have to have realistic expectations
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.160]   of what you're capable of doing.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.560]   And we know, you know, you don't go to playing symphonies
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.760]   and, you know, impressive pieces of composition on the piano
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.520]   till you've done the correct posture
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.720]   and drilling and reading and all those things.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.800]   So all that's built into this curriculum
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.760]   in the way that it's mapped,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.840]   helps a parent and or an older student assess,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.080]   hey, I kind of got lost here.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.560]   I need my map.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.280]   Let me go back to this section of the curriculum
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.080]   and then I'll be able to race ahead.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.680]   Just like you do when you're traveling around the globe.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.880]   Good days and bad days.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.360]   I mean, who wouldn't want to get lost in Paris?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.600]   Well, who wouldn't want to get lost in math?
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.640]   And yet we don't,
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.920]   because we've made it such a horrible experience.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.400]   - We have, and we've made it seem like
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.160]   there is a destination that we must all arrive at
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.920]   in a certain amount of time or,
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   and we don't care if you enjoy it or not,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.680]   we just need you to get finished.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.520]   And that's a sad thing.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.360]   So that's what I want us to talk about.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.840]   That's actually what I want us to talk about.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.280]   Why is it so hard for us to study math?
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.800]   Why is it so hard for families to study math
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.920]   in easy ways?
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   And I don't know, as I have walked through this math map
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.840]   on these weekly calls, doing the lessons week by week,
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.200]   it really impressed me that, man,
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.960]   sometimes it seems like we're doing less,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.120]   but understanding more.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:15.080]   So I think, listeners, the math map is way,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.200]   and maybe it's just me,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.640]   but the math map approaches math and math education
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.000]   and math conversations in a way
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.960]   that is wholly unlike anything I've ever experienced.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.560]   And so it seems much more gentle
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.720]   and much more exploratory.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.760]   And I know, I'm just gonna be really honest with you,
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.440]   as a type A mom, sometimes I look at that and think,
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.680]   it looks like a lot more fun,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.280]   but are we gonna get, are we gonna go,
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.960]   are we getting what we need to get?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.800]   Are we gonna come to the end
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.960]   and be able to talk, have a math conversation?
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   I need for you, Lee, to help us walk through this
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.120]   and see, help us to understand,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.560]   why is it so hard to study math in easy ways?
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.560]   And why is it that we need to do less and understand more?
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.160]   - Yeah, I mean, for anybody who's listening,
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.200]   just think about something that you enjoy doing.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.520]   In fact, we even call it our passions.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.080]   And passions root, of course,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.320]   is from the Latin meaning to suffer.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.280]   There are things we are just willing to suffer for,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.800]   and those are our passions, right?
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.320]   So we see our children willing to give up time,
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.640]   in order to buy another baseball card,
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.240]   they'll use their allowance.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.760]   I'm losing my words here, right?
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.920]   They'll put it towards the things
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.040]   that they're passionate about.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.240]   And so there's book clubs everywhere,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.200]   and there's welding classes,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.720]   and there's art classes,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.040]   and there's dance and symphonies and studios.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.280]   But where in the world do you go in your neighborhood
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.360]   to work on math together?
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.080]   - Yeah, nobody does that.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.760]   - Well, except the ones that are forced in,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.680]   they sit in a building.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.320]   - Right, and then they run away as soon as they can get out.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.360]   - It's not voluntary.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.600]   - That's right.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.920]   So what we need to do is to help the parents,
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.040]   not the children, but the adults who see this as an issue,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.440]   for them to learn to enjoy math,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.080]   and to want to be in math clubs,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.320]   and to see how affects their daily life in a positive way.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.840]   'Cause you'll never reach the children
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.480]   if the adults can't model it.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.840]   And the Lord made it that way.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.160]   We are not to usurp the responsibilities
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.720]   of the adults in the family,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.800]   but we are to come alongside and support and encourage them.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.320]   So the one way that the MathMap can help make this easier
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.960]   is by being in, like we started the conversation on,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.520]   in community.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.480]   Now, when we show up at classical conversations
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.000]   one day a week,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.320]   the Challenge A students won't be doing different math
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   than Challenge B,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.640]   and they won't be doing different math
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.200]   than the essentials and the foundations
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.280]   kids are doing at home.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.680]   They'll all be able to work on the same math.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.040]   And so they'll be able to have conversations
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.840]   that cross ages and grades,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.680]   and that cross families and cross generations.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.040]   'Cause we'll be on the same topic.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.680]   It's kind of like at the end of a sermon at church,
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.200]   and the pastor talked about Matthew 18,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.400]   we as a congregation can now all talk about Matthew 18
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.200]   as we're walking out the door and commenting on what he said
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   that it was what will become possible at CC.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.440]   And now you'll be able to say,
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.080]   "Gosh, I'm really bad at math.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.560]   "I better just go buy a software package."
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.640]   You don't have to do that anymore.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.480]   You'll be able to say,
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.240]   "Boy, I'm really bad at this problem,
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.000]   "but I know someone doing the exact same problem
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.440]   "this very week,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.280]   "and I'm gonna see 'em in a couple of days."
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.120]   That community unity, I believe, will escalate.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.440]   And my only evidence of that is logical.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.560]   It's not empirical.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.160]   We're not empiricists, but we are thinkers.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.320]   And it's this.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.720]   When we first started out in classical education
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.760]   in the '80s and '90s, you remember this,
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.120]   nobody wanted to study Latin.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.440]   Now every single charter school,
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.400]   public school, university,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.240]   they all wanna say, "Where are the classical subjects?"
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.360]   And it wasn't because we were so good at 'em.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.600]   It was because we were tenacious and persevered
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.200]   and said there's something that is historically good
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.240]   about knowing the language of our church
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.400]   over the last 2,000 years.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.280]   And I'm here to say,
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.120]   and there's something similarly just as good
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.600]   at knowing the language of creation
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.520]   and not just the church that has been spoken
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.080]   for the last over 2,000 years.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.480]   And so it really is an entering into a conversation
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.880]   that people were not invited into before.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.360]   And so that's why it wasn't easy.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.400]   They didn't know where to go.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.640]   - That is great.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.120]   And that is the inspiration, okay?
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.640]   So that is what, when I hear you talk about it,
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.000]   and when I hear the idea,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.560]   when I hear Kirstie talk about the Math Map,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.120]   that's what draws me in,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.000]   the inspiration to have conversations
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   with other people who are pondering and wrestling with
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.560]   and looking for these mathematical ideas
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.720]   out in the world with me so that I can say,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.000]   "Yeah, I'm not really seeing it.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.960]   "Where are you seeing it?
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.080]   "Help me see it."
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.240]   And they can help me.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.080]   And so I think that's really great.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.800]   And so I get really excited.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.000]   And I think a lot of people, Lee,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.200]   are very excited about that.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.160]   I do still think there's some people that,
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.960]   when they get home and they get inside their home
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.480]   every day with their children,
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.600]   and they pull out this little leaflet and they say,
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.800]   "Man, that doesn't look like very much math.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.120]   "I'm just supposed to have a conversation about this.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.640]   "How is that gonna help my child?"
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.240]   And I will tell you this.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.760]   When we first started going through the Math Map,
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.960]   and we're tracing things,
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.320]   and we're just noticing what is familiar,
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   what is unfamiliar, making simple leaps,
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:06.000]   finding the patterns, all of that just seems so good.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.440]   And I think, "Oh, but I'm not sure.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.720]   "I'm not sure.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.480]   "And my little child, my four-year-old
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.440]   "is gonna draw this infinity symbol?
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.280]   "How in the world am I gonna explain that
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.480]   "to a four-year-old?"
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.040]   And I had somebody say that to me.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   "Why are we doing that with a four-year-old?"
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.800]   And it made me stop and think.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.920]   20 years ago, people didn't believe,
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.800]   didn't understand why we were doing memory work
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.040]   with four-year-olds either.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.840]   But I never hear people ask me that anymore.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.680]   We all now believe that, "Oh, man,
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.880]   "those seventh graders know what to do
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.680]   "in literature, in history, in science,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.480]   "in math, and in Latin,
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.200]   "'cause they have all this undergirding memory work."
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.000]   And so I can see that the MathMap is really offering us
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.320]   an easy on-ramp to math conversations
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.240]   that are gonna grow and grow.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.720]   - Yeah, if you think about it,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.680]   people succeed in a community setting
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.360]   if there's some orderly preparation that's being done.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.640]   And so that doesn't mean we go home with anybody
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.080]   and make you do the exact same thing.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.600]   We're all different parts of that symphony orchestra
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.680]   or parts of the body.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.360]   But if you know that we're gonna be all working
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.560]   on the same language, English, Latin, history,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   they're all languages.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.680]   Well, now we're learning how to read math.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.880]   If we're all doing the same memory work,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.480]   which is what you have to do in order to read a language,
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.880]   right, you gotta memorize the words.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.800]   And then we can speak about the sentences
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.760]   and the images that invokes and discuss the problems
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.880]   that come out of that information.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.160]   That's the dialectic.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.400]   And then, whoa, I can actually explain that problem to you.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.640]   Or I can diagram that sentence.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.200]   I actually wrote a really good debate opening, right?
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.120]   That's, it's just the process of learning.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.840]   And what people maybe don't notice
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.440]   in all of classical conversations,
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.760]   it's set up the way it is
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.120]   because our littlest children work on words.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.560]   And those Essentials Challenge AB students,
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.440]   they're working on sentences.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.080]   And that AB1-2 student is working on paragraphs.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.760]   And that merges more into two, three, and four words,
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.200]   not just essays, but whole body essays
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.560]   through presenting these things that they've been studying,
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.080]   outlining, reading, writing, doing arithmetic on.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.320]   And what has not been done very well in modern education
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.120]   is showing that progression through mathematics.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.280]   We used to have it.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.840]   This is, there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.600]   My grandmother would totally have understood
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.040]   what I'm doing here.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.400]   Because when she graduated into 1920s,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.720]   grammar school from eighth grade,
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.000]   she had spent time studying Euclidean geometry
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.120]   'cause that was the only kind to study, right?
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:00.960]   So everybody-
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.440]   - Yes, yes.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.560]   - So there was an order to it.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.520]   She did her times tables and her facts.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.800]   And then she did the drawings
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.280]   that goes along with geometry.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.080]   And then you have to do some algebraic arithmetic
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.360]   in order to figure out what the missing length
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.400]   of the side of a polygon is.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.640]   I mean, they used to know the order
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.920]   and we just don't anymore.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.520]   So I think that's what's gonna,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.360]   the math map's gonna change is in many ways,
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.960]   'cause I don't want people to get the wrong idea.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.440]   There's lots of math in the curriculum.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.120]   You've been mostly addressing our naturals,
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.040]   which is more kindergarten, first, second grade level.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.880]   - Exactly.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.920]   - Once you hit about, well, fractions,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.480]   lots of calculations,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.400]   but they're grammatically easy calculations.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.040]   And then you move into our complex strand,
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.400]   which is challenge A.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.840]   And now we're looking at imaginary numbers
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.440]   as well as all the real numbers.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.920]   There are very simplistic calculations,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.120]   but they are practicing all the domains
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.760]   over and over again.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.720]   So as soon as they move on to those monomials and binomials,
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.440]   they know what all the various numbers are.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.480]   And we actually can start saying,
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.760]   now let's just give you some more raw problems
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.920]   for lack of a better word.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.760]   - Yes, yes.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.640]   - It's scaffolding you and supporting you
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   and all the things that you need.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.800]   And now let's start taking away some of those tools
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.600]   that are available to you still,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.440]   but let's see what you can do with your mind.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.720]   - Yes, but they don't need it.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.040]   They don't need the crutches.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   They don't need the scaffolding as much anymore.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.960]   They probably not even notice
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.800]   that they don't need it anymore.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.120]   - Well, and that's our hope.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.320]   And then of course, because we exist in community
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.120]   and we're fallen and we have families,
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.240]   we'll have people who can say,
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.560]   yeah, but you could do better.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.400]   Or, wait a minute, did you look it up in the charts
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.680]   or the glossary?
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.520]   Because we'll all have the same tools.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.360]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.680]   That's so great.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.360]   That is really, really great.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.000]   So let me, so what, if somebody came up to you right now
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.960]   and said, okay, this sounds really good.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.680]   I'm really excited.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   What's the biggest advantage of the MathMap for families?
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.800]   And then what's the biggest advantage
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.920]   of the MathMap for students?
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.600]   What's the biggest advantage for parents?
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.960]   And I feel like probably you have addressed
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.280]   all of these already,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.600]   but I want to hear in this one answer
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.360]   so that people can think about it all at the same time.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.840]   So the biggest advantage for students
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.800]   and the biggest advantage for parents.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.480]   - So for students, I believe the biggest advantage
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.680]   is they'll learn how to read math.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.480]   They may not learn how to calculate hard problems,
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.400]   but they should be able to at least be able to read them
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.720]   and say, I've seen that before.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.240]   Those words, I have an inkling about what they are.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.000]   - That's great.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.840]   - That's the first thing.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.680]   - All right, so, yes.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.520]   - And as a family, the thing that's so great
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.760]   is that you'll be able to talk about those things
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.800]   and embed some of those ideas through conversation,
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.400]   experience, and activities.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.720]   And one of the most important activities
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.000]   is memorizing tables and facts.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.960]   And you can do that with the dog.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.800]   Like everybody can do that together.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   So that's kind of that one family schoolhouse ability there.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.360]   But what I hope will happen with the parents
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.800]   is that through the exordiums and the artwork
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.400]   and the various stories, and then the companion
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.320]   that has all the instructions in it,
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.080]   and all of it, we tried our very best
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.120]   to glorify God through all of it,
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.400]   that the parents will be able to start to have an answer
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.840]   for when your child says, but I'll never use this.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.240]   The parents should be able to say, oh, yes, you will, hon.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.880]   And this is how you'll see the Lord in a way
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.480]   you never expected.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.400]   I can't wait for 20 years out when I say to somebody,
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.880]   how is math orderly?
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   Or how does math work by God?
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.200]   They pour out with examples.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   Now everybody has one or two.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   And if the adult population,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.880]   the adult Christian population can start seeing the unseen
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.240]   that mathematics reveals to us,
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.800]   I believe that in 20 years,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.560]   our children will start being able to also.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.120]   And just like universities across the United States
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.920]   want CC students because of their debating skills
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.880]   and reading skills and writing skills,
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.520]   they shake your hand, they look in your eye.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.160]   They're also gonna be saying, and you know what?
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.560]   They're really good at math.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.880]   - Uh-huh, yes, yes, yes.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.440]   I love that, Lee.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.400]   That's awesome.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:23.640]   So what is, because we are going to begin
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.000]   rolling the math map out
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.200]   through all our communities everywhere
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.800]   with our Challenge A families in the fall.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.040]   So give us the 30 second explanation of the math map
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.560]   and a winsome reason to abandon the math education
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.400]   that we've gotten accustomed to and embrace the math map.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.480]   - Ask yourself if the curriculum you're using now,
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.960]   its entire mission is to embrace the body of Christ's
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.600]   ability to know God and make Him known.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.400]   If it's any lesser purpose, move away.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.240]   - You know what?
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:10.200]   That's awesome because I think we have sold out to,
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.560]   yeah, our whole purpose of education
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.440]   is to know God and make Him known.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.240]   And we also do math.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.400]   We read stories and we see how it talks about
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.760]   how this literature shows us the human condition
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.320]   and the power of God.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.680]   And we look at science, we've gotten to where we see,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.960]   we can see God in the origins
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.280]   and we've done all that good stuff.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.560]   And we see God's hand in history and the rise and fall
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.400]   of people following Him, and math.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.200]   And so this is amazing to me.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.640]   It's a kind of a mind-blowing thing.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.080]   So I love that, that the most winsome reason
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   to begin using the math map
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.520]   instead of what we've been doing
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.120]   is that the math map will lead us
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   to embrace the belief that we can know God
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.800]   and make Him known.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.640]   And that math is another way to see Him
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.800]   and another way to participate in the relationship with Him.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.760]   - There's been so much in worldview change
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.520]   of our adult lives, Lisa,
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.200]   and it's very much our own fault.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.720]   How can you expect a non-believer
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.640]   to even embrace academically what Christians believe
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.160]   and we can't explain it ourselves?
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   And what I hope to see in 20 years
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.680]   is that someone starts to say,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.520]   you know, those CC kids,
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.640]   I've never really understood the whole Christian,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.280]   evolution, creation story,
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.840]   but they know math and they've read all these agents.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.440]   Maybe I should listen to what they say about science.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.400]   But we give them no reason,
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.760]   no credible reason to pay attention to us.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.360]   So let's change that.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.160]   - Amen, woman, amen.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.040]   Preach it, preach it.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.320]   So let me ask you this,
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.160]   what will be for families this fall in their homes,
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.600]   what will be, do you think,
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.840]   the biggest change for families
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.920]   as they begin to use the math map?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.800]   How is it gonna feel initially?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.080]   And there is gonna be some of this is really different,
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.880]   this feels weird, this doesn't feel like it used to feel.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.600]   How are we gonna get over that hurdle?
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   - So for those who are already in CC,
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.440]   remember how you felt
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.320]   when you first started Essentials or Latin?
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.600]   It's so overwhelming at work first.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.200]   And what we're hearing through five years
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.800]   of piloting the math map
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.200]   is for about this first six weeks, people don't like it,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.560]   but they don't like it because it is unfamiliar
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.200]   and it's a new strategy.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.360]   After about week six, they start to go,
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.760]   oh, this is gonna happen every week
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.360]   and they start to see the map
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.440]   and they start to read the language
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.720]   and then the children start to see
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.440]   that they can do similar work to their siblings
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.600]   and that they can be helpful to one another.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.720]   But really, it's just unfamiliar.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.280]   So expect it to be unfamiliar.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.040]   And then expect this, it is math.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.800]   If you don't love math, it's gonna take some time.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.640]   - That's good, that's an excellent reminder.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.880]   It is not a magic pill.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.840]   It is not, it's not gonna just make you magically love math,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.360]   but I used to say to my Challenge B parents,
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.840]   because the students were not usually wigged out
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.480]   by studying formal logic.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.680]   They didn't know that, but they're parents.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.440]   So I would say to the parents,
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.720]   I can't, I'll never be able to make you love it.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:40.880]   I can help you not be afraid of it anymore.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.760]   We're gonna get familiar.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.240]   And you might actually never love it
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.320]   the way you love literature or the way you love Latin
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.840]   or the way you love debate, okay?
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.000]   Maybe you'll never love math that way,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.680]   but you can get to the point where you're not afraid of it
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.440]   and you can participate in the conversation.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.720]   That's awesome.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:04.680]   So what would you tell parents who are nervous
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.440]   about making this kind of change?
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.960]   - Well, I mean, there's so many different personality types
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.800]   and the reasons why you might be nervous,
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.080]   but for the folks who are kind of perfectionist
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.240]   and you wanna fall back on what is familiar to you,
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.680]   I would encourage you to actually go do Naturals,
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.600]   which is on CC Connected, free available to you now,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.800]   so you can start to become familiar with it
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.240]   before you're expecting anything from your children.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.480]   - That is good.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.960]   That is really good.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.400]   The nervous parents who are just worried about the change,
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   that's a really excellent suggestion
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.000]   because it gives parents time to get their feet wet
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.360]   and see what it's like.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.680]   - The thing for the folks who really love math
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.160]   and are unfamiliar with this approach also,
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.640]   I'm already seeing this over the last couple of years.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.280]   We have an active forum at the map.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   It's on the CC Connected site.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.920]   And the ones who love math, boy, are they there arguing.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.240]   And you know, it makes me so happy
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.480]   because it's like they're like,
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.720]   "Finally, there's someone to talk to about this."
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.880]   - Yes, yes.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.280]   - So both ends will have things they have to deal with,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.880]   the less confident person and the more experienced.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.760]   But that's why we're entering in a conversation.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.200]   And Lisa, I gotta leave soon.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.640]   So one of the things I wanna end with
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.520]   is to remember that all of us are just practicing.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.960]   And only Jesus on the cross could say it is finished.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.920]   And for somebody who thinks they know math really well,
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.040]   hold on to your seat because some mama
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.000]   or some kid that doesn't know math at all
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.440]   is gonna ask you a question
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.840]   about something you're studying.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.120]   And you're gonna go, "Oh, I'll be dang, I have no idea."
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.840]   - I don't know.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   I love that.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.520]   That is an awesome place to end, Lee.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.080]   Here's the thing that can make us all feel better about this.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.640]   Nobody, including God himself,
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.120]   is expecting us to get this all right.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.200]   We're never going to get it all.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.320]   We are all continually gonna be practicing.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.520]   But with the math map,
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.960]   we can practice and community all together,
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.040]   exploring at our own level
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.320]   and growing the way we are being led to grow.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.840]   This is really exciting.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.280]   So Lee, thank you so much for introducing the math map
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.760]   in this way to our listeners.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.680]   And I hope that you guys are as excited as I am.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.440]   And Lee, thank you so much for sharing that vision with us.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.280]   - You're so welcome.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.880]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.720]   - I loved it.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.840]   Okay, families, if you want more practice with math,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.080]   I have good news for you.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   Classical Conversations summer practicum season is coming.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.040]   The 2024 practicum event
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.400]   is gonna be ready for you to sign up for soon.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.640]   But what I want you to know
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.640]   is that the focus of the practicum this summer
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:58.520]   is on the art of learning and teaching math classically.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.920]   The best way, obviously, to study math.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.960]   And you're gonna get the opportunity
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.120]   to learn even more about the math map,
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.440]   our brand new Classical Conversations math curriculum.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   You're gonna be able to participate
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.720]   in table talk discussions with other parents,
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.360]   and you're gonna learn how to engage your own students
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.960]   in math conversations.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.680]   So if you are already eager to find out
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.800]   when your local practicum is gonna meet,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.160]   visit ccpracticum.com.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   That's ccpracticum.com and find out all about it.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:41.480]   All right, listeners, go and educate with your families,
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.240]   and I'll see you next week.
