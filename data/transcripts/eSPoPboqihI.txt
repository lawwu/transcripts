[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   There was a video clip recently posted on Instagram by Jackie Hill Perry, who is a wife
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.960]   and a mom, a poet and a hip hop artist, and of course, a guest writer for us at Desiring God.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.160]   We are fans of her work, and the clip that she posted is a really bold and insightful
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.640]   word to married couples. I'll play the audio for you, Pastor John,
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.800]   and then I want to get your thoughts. Here's the clip.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560]   Question. How often are you honest with your spouse about your lustful temptation?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.520]   When it comes to men, I think it might be two reasons why they might be unwilling to share
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.960]   with their wives about their struggle. One, they like it. They enjoy entertaining the fact
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.840]   that other women want them, or the ideas that pop up in their minds about what they could do
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.240]   with other women. That is a heart issue. Two, you women too insecure to take it.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.000]   Every time this man want to let you in on what he's struggling with, you want to get in your
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.760]   feeling. So what you trying to say, you was thinking about another woman, and she was in
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   your dreams? So you telling me I'm not worth dreaming about now? Girl, calm down. You should
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.600]   let the fact that he let you in on his heart give you security, and the reassurance that he loves
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.720]   you. Letting our spouses in on our issue gives them the opportunity to hold us accountable
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.600]   and pray for us, and it uproots any opportunity for Satan to wreak havoc on our marriages through
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.000]   secrets. She gets to the point, doesn't she? Pastor John, any thoughts that you would add to
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.440]   this discussion? Jackie Hill Perry is very thoughtful. She's a thoughtful young woman,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.680]   and it's manifest in this penetrating analysis into a man's love affair with lust,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.960]   and a woman's fears of letting her man talk to her about it. She isn't just blowing steam here.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.240]   She's seeing, seeing through and seeing into, and that's a great gift that every
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.160]   Christian should aspire to. Another thing, as I listened, that makes these couple minutes
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.680]   compelling is that she's balanced. She goes after both men and women in their respective
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.600]   sins and weaknesses. She's not just harping on the man or harping on the woman. It takes two
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   to tango, and it takes two to play hide and seek, especially hide, and she gets that right.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:34.240]   The third thing that I thought of as I listened that adds depth to what she says is that she takes
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   Satan seriously. There are a lot of people who don't even believe in Satan, and they're Christians
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   who never give serious thought to how deceptive and destructive his designs are. Jackie draws
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.480]   our attention to the truth that Satan works in the dark. He's like roaches. You turn the light on,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:03.760]   he goes away. You keep the light off, he might run right up your leg. When Paul says in 2 Corinthians
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   2, 11 that we are not ignorant of Satan's designs, he was referring to the unwillingness to forgive.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.560]   That's a field day. That's a dark kitchen for the roach of Satan. Maybe there, however,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:31.040]   is a kitchen that is darker than the kitchen of unforgiveness, and that would be the kitchen that
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   is so dark nobody even knows there's a need to be forgiven. At one time you were darkness,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.840]   but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light, Ephesians 5.8,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.880]   or as James says, James 5.16, confess your sins to one another, and surely Jackie's onto something
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.040]   with husbands and wives here in applying it to that relationship. Confess your sins to one another
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.080]   that you may be healed. She would add, and I would add, that Satan might not get the upper hand in
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.680]   your relationship through all the darkness of unconfessed sin that you don't even know about.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   If I would add anything to what Jackie says, I might say to the guys, Jackie stressed lustful
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.080]   thoughts in which you think about doing things with other women. Don't let yourself off the hook
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.840]   if you say, "Well, I don't fantasize about doing things with other women. I just fantasize about
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   seeing things." Jesus said, "Everyone who looks at a woman to desire her has already committed
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.240]   adultery in his heart." So the question is, is that woman in your head your wife? That's the
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.640]   question. And the last thing that I would add is this. If there's going to be enough deep security
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.480]   and strength in this woman's heart and the man's heart, I would say, to welcome this kind of
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.840]   honesty that she's commending, then both of them will need to lay some pretty massive foundations
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:20.720]   of Christ-centered commitment beforehand. And I mean like rock solid, unshakable, blood-bought,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.600]   spirit-dependent, Bible-saturated commitment. Namely, divorce by either one of us is not an
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:36.320]   option. Noelle and I, my wife and I, said that divorce is not an option to each other over the
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:46.240]   last 47 years, many times. And in our darkest, stormiest seasons, we knew there was hope to get
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.000]   through the storm because we had promised, "Nobody's jumping out of this plane." So thank you,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.840]   Jackie, for wise and penetrating words. I hope they bear much fruit. Yes, amen. Thank you. And
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.480]   thank you, Jackie, for this and for your online ministry. You're really serving the church well.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.960]   And thank you, Pastor John, for your thoughts here as well, too. On Wednesday, we return,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.040]   and we're going to talk about the Old Testament and how to interpret it. Specifically, what
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.960]   promises of God to Israel apply to us as contemporary American and Western readers of
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.080]   the Bible today? It's a question readers for ages have been asking and wrestling with,
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.480]   and we will talk more about it on Wednesday. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.120]   you
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.160]   you
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.660]   you
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.160]   you
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.240]   you
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.300]   you
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:43.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
