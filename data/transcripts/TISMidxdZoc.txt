[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio,
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.600]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.920]   He is a legendary investor,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.120]   founder of Bridgewater Associates,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.480]   author of a book I highly recommend called "Principles,"
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.960]   and also a new book called "Principles for Dealing
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.840]   "with a Changing World Order,"
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.480]   that looks at the geopolitics of today,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.580]   especially US and China, through the lens of history,
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.120]   providing a fascinating model
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.200]   for the rise and fall of empires
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.300]   that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.320]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.360]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.520]   in the description.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.040]   And now, here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.200]   When you look at the history of the world,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.880]   as you have done in your new book,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.760]   "Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order,"
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.300]   what is more important, more impactful, money or power?
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.480]   - They go hand in hand.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.120]   They support each other and they compete with each other.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.380]   Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.600]   That power has to do with all that they can buy,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.520]   but it also has the ability to influence
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.400]   those with political power.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.260]   And so you see this throughout history,
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.340]   this symbiotic relationship, you know,
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.340]   for example, between the royal families,
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.400]   and the nobility, and the church.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.160]   So you see that group of people
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.080]   supporting each other in various ways,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.480]   and then wrestling around with each other
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.880]   for the money and power among that group.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.640]   So the dynamic that's quite classic
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.840]   is you could look at the parties in power,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.760]   back in, you know, the 16th, 17th centuries,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.640]   you would look at royal families, nobles,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   and the church, if you're in Europe,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.040]   and then you would look at agricultural land,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   and there was a certain dynamic.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.100]   And that varies over time, it changes,
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.440]   as those people get thrown out, and technology changes.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.120]   So when we evolved, when the society evolved,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.040]   so that it would produce goods and services,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.960]   and you have something like the Industrial Revolution,
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.560]   the first Industrial Revolution,
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.280]   they have machines, and you have the talent of people
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.000]   that are off the farms,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440]   and then you have a struggling for power,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   you see that power mix change.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.920]   And so we don't see that same power mix anymore,
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   but you still see the same dynamic.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.680]   You see those with money dealing with those
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.600]   who have political power around those assets
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.680]   that are considered most valuable
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.360]   to particularly the productive assets that produce money.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.820]   - And political power is usually centered
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.560]   around nation state, so the major locus
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.880]   is if power is the nations?
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   - Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   there was the development of nation states.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.680]   Before then, we had, it was really the development
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.520]   of countries as we know it, that there were borders,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.440]   and that within those borders,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.960]   those who had control got to control it,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.080]   and there were not to be intrusions in those borders,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.540]   and that's how we established the nation state.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.440]   And then of course, within each country, there is levels.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.360]   There is a central level, and then there is a,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   typically a province or state level down below,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.980]   and then there's a municipal level,
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.680]   so they each have different levels of power,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.440]   and it's the coordination of those
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.920]   that determines how the country is run.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.280]   - You write that the quote, "archetypal big cycle
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.800]   "governs the rising and declining empires
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.840]   "and influences everything about them,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.280]   "including their currencies and markets.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.720]   "The most important three cycles
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.020]   "are the ones you mentioned in the introduction,
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.140]   "the long-term debt and capital market cycle,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.460]   "the internal order and disorder cycle,
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.640]   "and the external order and disorder cycle."
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.400]   Can you describe this big cycle?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.660]   - There are two orders.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.320]   There is an order by a, order, I mean a system,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.880]   how the system works.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.600]   So there's an internal order,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.100]   that is the internal governance system,
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.720]   and it's usually set out in a constitution
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.400]   or some agreements, and then there's the world order,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.700]   how the world system.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.700]   So for example, in 1945, at the end of a war,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.280]   which is basically a fight for determining the world order,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.600]   the winners of the fight got together
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.440]   and created the world system as we now know it.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.920]   '44, they created the Brenton Woods monetary system
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.640]   that determined the money, pretty much,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.440]   and because the United States won
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.120]   and had 80% of the world's money,
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.200]   gold was money then, and it had 80% of the world's gold,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.800]   and it was half the world's economy,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.500]   and it was the great military power,
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.280]   the order was built around an American world order,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.480]   so that the United Nations was in New York,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.960]   the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.740]   and they built that new order.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.720]   So classically, you have a war to determine
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.640]   whose rules we're following,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.380]   and then you have the new order being constructed.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.200]   After that, there is usually period
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.920]   of extended peace and prosperity.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.260]   Peace suits prosperity, and so there's not,
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.000]   and the reason you have the peace
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.800]   is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.080]   you know you're gonna lose, you've surrendered,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.320]   there's been the surrendering.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.480]   They carve up the world, they say what it's gonna look like,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.160]   who's gonna control what,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.680]   and then you come into that period of peace,
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   and then prosperity, where then there's a working together.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.840]   Usually, at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.660]   you've wiped out a lot of the issues,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.960]   the class warfare and so on,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.820]   and then there's good working together.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.820]   So those great periods, such as the Industrial Revolution
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.300]   in the late 1800s, or what we've experienced
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.960]   in the post-World War II period,
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.280]   are peaceful and prosperous periods,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.560]   led largely by the dominant world power.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.200]   Over a period of time, since really 1500,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.780]   and maybe before, but really 1500,
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.860]   when the Dutch invented capitalism,
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.040]   and what I mean by that,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.640]   they invented the first capital markets,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.580]   the first stocks and the first stock market,
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.440]   that since then, capitalism has been an effective tool
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.820]   for building wealth, because it got resources
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.020]   into the hands of inventive people.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.540]   That's when we move from agriculture
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.840]   to the importance of inventiveness of people,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.500]   they got resources, and then they built that prosperity.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.020]   In that process of doing that,
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.060]   they create wealth gaps, naturally.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.180]   Those who make a lot of money make a lot more
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.000]   than those that don't,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.220]   and it also produces opportunity gaps,
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.020]   because, for example, those who earn a lot of money
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.580]   have that wealth, they have the power
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.940]   to educate their children in a way that others don't,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.980]   and the gaps grow, and also the debts grow at that time.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:43.540]   When they go around the world with their competitiveness,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.060]   they earn a lot of money.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.020]   So, for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire,
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.020]   learned how to build ships that would go around the world.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.980]   A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.580]   is the improvement of education,
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.260]   and by education, I mean the skills that come from education
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.680]   but also civility, the ability to deal well together.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.380]   So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.720]   and they had military power,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.420]   but they were also a very inventive society.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.420]   25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.740]   And so as they went around the world,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.300]   they also brought their currency,
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.260]   and they brought their military.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.660]   They needed the currency, they paid for things,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.660]   and that currency, and then the more that happens,
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.020]   the more that becomes a reserve currency.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.180]   And then they have their military,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.060]   so they need their military strength,
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.960]   and so you see it evolve in all of those ways.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.060]   But over a period of time,
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.420]   as they become more successful and more expensive,
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.220]   they become more expensive.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:01.820]   And newer countries come along, like the UK,
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.800]   then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch,
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.500]   and could do that less expensively.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.420]   And also when they become more expensive,
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.100]   so less competitive,
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.060]   and also the work ethic begins to change.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.660]   They believe that since they're richer,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.660]   they can enjoy life more.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.260]   They don't have to work quite as hard.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.060]   And so you start to see the tilt.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.160]   Now you start to see the development of the top.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.380]   And when you have a world reserve currency,
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.000]   that allows you to borrow a lot of money,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.340]   because those who want to save,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.940]   wanna hold your money,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.060]   and that means that they'll lend you money,
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.140]   and so those countries get deeper into debt.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.380]   So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.300]   and they get themselves into financial circumstances,
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.700]   which are not good,
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.460]   and they have large wealth gaps,
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.660]   which set the stage for downturns.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.700]   And when they have downturns,
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.140]   the first question is, do they have enough money?
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.140]   And traditionally, money is resources.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.000]   So you classically see that the coffers are bare,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   that they're spending more money than they are earning,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.920]   and they run out of money in the coffers.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.620]   And their granaries are empty,
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.180]   rather than stocked,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.340]   so that they give them the buffer.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.340]   And as that deteriorates, that worsens conditions.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.580]   And if they have a rival power,
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.500]   that's also challenging them,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.820]   they see greater internal conflict over wealth,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.420]   and then they have the problems internally,
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.100]   and the problems externally,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.660]   which usually results in an internal war,
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.480]   or an external war,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.740]   that leads to the change in the,
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.000]   to the new world order.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.760]   - And to you, the Dutch Empire is a good example of that.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.180]   The British, what are some of the key examples
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.200]   that you think about in the book,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.320]   of this process that followed the big cycle?
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.200]   - Well, the leading reserve currency empires,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.460]   but it applies to all the empires,
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.820]   were the Dutch, the British, the American, and the Chinese.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.660]   But you could follow the same pattern.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.420]   In the book, it was very important for me
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.020]   to not just use words and concepts,
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.380]   because that's subjective.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.800]   It was very important for me to use actual measurements.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.480]   So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.060]   You can see where's the education level,
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.560]   what is the military power, each one of those,
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.320]   and you can see them back going over the 500 years.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.400]   And so you can see the arcs and the composition
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.280]   of those arcs, and what you see is really,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.800]   in most countries and most dynasties, you can see that.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.520]   But you also can see through those numbers,
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.000]   the health of those countries.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Today, there are statistics that are in the book,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.160]   that show what is the level of education,
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.280]   what is the level of economic output,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.140]   what is the level of military strength,
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.200]   what is the level of a number of different
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.000]   measures of strength, so that you can then compare that.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.020]   And I think that because there are objective
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.320]   measures of strength that you could see change,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.160]   that shows the picture of where we are today.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.200]   And I think one of the most important things
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.360]   about the book is that it allows people to monitor
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.680]   how those things are transpiring.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.780]   I think for policy makers,
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.200]   are your policy makers doing a good job?
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.320]   And there's so much subjectivity in that.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   But I think it's very simple.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.920]   If those lines on the chart are improving,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.360]   if your health index is improving,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.660]   then you're moving toward a better life.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.340]   So that's what the book works like.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.100]   Also, it was used to create a model for the future.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.200]   In other words, there are cause-effect relationships.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.040]   Everything that happens has reasons,
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.860]   causes that preceded it, that made it happen.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.020]   And so by having all those in numbers,
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.440]   one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.780]   So that's what you see in the book.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.940]   It's not just Ray's interpretation.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.920]   I didn't wanna make it Ray's interpretation
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.860]   'cause I don't know if I'm right.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.220]   - Yeah, so one of the fascinating things in the book,
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.800]   so you have to list these 18 measures.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.460]   And there's like a little scorecard
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.360]   for the countries of the world today.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.780]   So let's say US, China, and Europe.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.940]   And what it was 20 years ago,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.940]   and looking at the change from 20 years ago,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.560]   and that's another indicator,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.220]   the change itself to see where things are headed.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.500]   Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective,
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.100]   how is US and China doing?
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.700]   And in the 18 measures, what are some measures
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.460]   that stand out to you as particularly important
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.500]   to think about today for the United States, for China?
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.740]   - Well, there are a number.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   Financially, what you see in the United States
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.840]   is that we're borrowing a lot more money,
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.440]   And our capacity to do that is very much,
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.800]   is limited, first of all,
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.860]   because when there's a sale of a bond,
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.460]   when the government borrows more than it borrows money
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.400]   because it spends more than it takes in,
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.320]   you have to sell a bond.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.660]   And the world right now has a lot of US dollar
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.260]   denominated bonds because as the world's reserve currency,
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.940]   they sell, sold on them.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   And they have very bad returns, negative real returns,
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.760]   negative real returns significantly, and so on.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.640]   So that means that more bonds has to be sold
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.700]   than are bought.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.040]   And that means that the Federal Reserve
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.680]   is faced with the choice of having to raise
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.140]   the interest rate to curtail borrowing,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.000]   which slows the economy and hurts the markets,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   or by filling that difference and producing money,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.760]   the debt monetization, which produces an inflation
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.480]   in goods, services, and financial assets.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   So in that regard, that's the United States' position.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.920]   In China's case, its balance of payments is better.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.580]   China has displaced the United States
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.740]   as the world's largest trading country.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.420]   In other words, more exports to other countries.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.420]   And as a result, it's economically competitive,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.360]   but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.760]   It's a real blessing.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.540]   So the United States has the world's reserve currency,
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.020]   but it is risking it because of this imbalance.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.380]   So if you look at history, you see that those go slowly,
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.000]   but when they go eventually, they go quickly.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.820]   So there's a risk of that financially.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.480]   Then there's the issue of internal order.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.260]   So I'm just giving you the major ones,
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.720]   but I'll get into some of the other ones too.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.920]   Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   in the United States, which affects how well it works.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.660]   In China, there's less internal conflict
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.740]   because it's a more autocratic state,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.440]   but also they've created this bifurcation
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.440]   of what is political and what is economic
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.040]   in terms of producing that prosperity.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.700]   So if you stay out of the politics, pretty much,
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.640]   and then you're seeing entrepreneurship,
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.360]   you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.860]   And so that internal working,
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.320]   that's subject to different people's interpretations,
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.560]   whether they like it or not,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.040]   but the internal conflict in terms
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.960]   of those kinds of measures is less.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.160]   - Sorry to pause on that for a second.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.360]   So these measures, I guess you don't want to sort of
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.800]   romanticize any one measure or something like that,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.980]   over-interpret any one measure,
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.040]   but is internal conflict always a bad thing?
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.280]   Is it a complicated calculation?
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.560]   Or do you kind of, the way we think about these measures
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.160]   that you've presented, we should be thinking like
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.320]   the higher, the better, the lower, the worse?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.520]   I mean, of course, depending on the--
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.240]   - Well, in many cases, the conflict
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   that produces the revolution produces revolutionary changes
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.020]   that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:49.600]   And so their short-term, a short-term civil war
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.920]   is a hellacious experience.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.680]   And at the same time, it can be the transition
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.960]   to a new beginning.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.740]   Also, there are different types of conflict.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:08.760]   Competition, which makes things, makes everything better,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:14.440]   is a productive conflict, whereas destructive conflicts
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.960]   are not good over the short time.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.600]   So that's how those go.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   - So within each measure, the story is complicated.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.280]   - Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.180]   meaning how much political conflict,
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.800]   how much social conflict.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.620]   In other words, you can measure conflict,
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.220]   you can measure fighting, you can measure crime rates,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.220]   you can measure lots of different ways of conflict.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.400]   So the measures are a composite of different types
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.600]   of internal conflict.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.840]   - What are some other interesting measures,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.880]   maybe if you can also mention that for me in particular,
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.280]   interest is education and innovation.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.840]   - Yes, the classic cycle, the most important
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.160]   leading indicator, is the quality of education.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.020]   Most importantly, broad-based education
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.820]   drawn from the largest population,
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.540]   because you can never tell who the talent is going to be,
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.040]   where they're gonna come from.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.140]   So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties,
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.140]   the great Chinese dynasties, and the Confucian approach,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:38.180]   it was meritocratic of, everybody could sit for exams
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.560]   and so on, broad base of drawing in the populations.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.260]   And you see that if you go across societies,
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.040]   because that draws on the largest number of population
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   to get education, and it also, that creates
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:00.000]   a reality and a perception that the system is fairer,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   equal opportunity, not just one of privilege,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.320]   and that helps to create social stability.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   But education is not just education in understanding
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.780]   facts and so on, it is education in civility,
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.260]   of how to behave together.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.060]   And so if they're smart, they understand
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.620]   how to be productive, because they work well together
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.380]   and they're productive.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.060]   And then that leads to the next stage.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.060]   You can see in the lines in the charts, I plotted these,
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.720]   so that you could see in a typical cycle,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.600]   you could see that education is the long leading indicator.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.420]   And then you could see, as you mentioned,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.740]   that what you see is inventiveness and technology measures
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.200]   then follow, and you see then also competitiveness
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.960]   and world markets follows.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.180]   For example, in the early stages of a cycle,
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.360]   the industries that they go into tend to be
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.260]   very basic industry, 'cause they have cheap labor,
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.500]   something like textiles and simple manufactured goods
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.380]   and so on.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.560]   But as the education rises, then they move up
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   the value chain to greater technologies and so on,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.200]   which raises incomes and raises productivity.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.180]   So yes, those, and as you say, there are 18 different
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.580]   measures like that, but education and then civility
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.780]   and the inventiveness.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.080]   So you see it reflected in who's inventing what.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.780]   And that corresponds then who's trading with,
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.940]   who's a big trading country, and where's the value
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.780]   of economic output and what are per capita incomes.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.740]   They all follow those arcs.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.980]   - Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.580]   about your book, so there's philosophy, there's wisdom,
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.660]   but there's plots.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.140]   - Yeah, you can see it.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.380]   - So it's not just your opinion,
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.300]   it's kind of like you can interpret it any way you like,
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.580]   but you're just giving a lot of your own insights
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.740]   along with the numbers.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.580]   If you were to look at the American nation,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.740]   the American empire, and the trajectories looking
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.440]   into the future, given these measures,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.940]   what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.820]   of the American empire based on these measures?
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.540]   What are the concerning indicators?
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.480]   And if those break down further, what does that look like?
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.500]   - Well, all of those indicators are concerning.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:47.460]   Maybe except for one, which is technology,
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.100]   the technology niche, although even in that area,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.100]   the United States is improving at a slower rate
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.720]   than is China for various advantages that they have there.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.240]   They put out about eight times as many computer engineers,
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.720]   they have free data, and so on.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   But if you look at them, so the financial is a concern,
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.300]   the internal order, disorder, is a concern.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.400]   Then if you look at education levels,
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.940]   the United States is in many ways,
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.120]   is losing its educational advantage.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   If you were to look at, compare it with China,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.960]   if you take general public education in the United States,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.880]   it's deteriorated tremendously,
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.780]   even in comparison to developed countries.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.860]   There are scores, PISA scores, and so on,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.900]   and it's something like 38th in the world or something,
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.440]   and that was a big plunge, average public education.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.880]   If you look at the best universities in the world,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.580]   the United States is unique
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.880]   in having the best universities in the world,
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.380]   so there are these privileged spots
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.420]   that are excellent, uniquely excellent.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.220]   So when you look at the comparison,
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.700]   education in China is improving rapidly,
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.700]   and the quantity is, a quantity of educated people
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.540]   in the areas that they're moving in is greater,
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.200]   and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.500]   and so you see the results are greater,
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.440]   but it's sort of along the lines that I'm dealing with.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.880]   If you were to follow through in terms of
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.080]   actual productions, I think you know,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.000]   in terms of technologies,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.480]   there are some areas that the United States
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.640]   is in a lead at the moment.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.880]   There's some areas that China's in a lead,
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.960]   but China's gaining very quickly.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.140]   When I first went to China, 1984,
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.140]   I would bring $10 calculators,
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.020]   and I gave them away as gifts to high-ranking people,
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.340]   and they thought they were miracle devices.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:13.260]   Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.220]   and AI and, you know, many areas,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.440]   you have a race going on,
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.820]   and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness,
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.920]   not just look at the current level,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.340]   you have a situation where they're improving
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.220]   at a much faster rate.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.980]   This is all good for the world if the world can get along,
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.640]   and the main thing I think is,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.380]   in just, how do you have a healthy world,
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.940]   and how do you have a strong economy,
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.920]   and how do you have a strong situation, is be strong.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.580]   The United States' war is with itself.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.380]   That's the main war.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.460]   You know, it's very simple in history.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:03.100]   Be financially sound, earn more than you spend,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.180]   and be strong in these ways,
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.780]   and pretty much everything will take care of itself.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:15.180]   - But you make it sound simple, of course,
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.980]   'cause there's a momentum when things degrade,
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.660]   when the education system degrades,
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.460]   when you start borrowing,
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.140]   I mean, all of these indicators,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.020]   once they start going down,
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.420]   there's a momentum to it, right?
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.180]   So it's hard to reverse it.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.660]   - Right, and there are circumstances that you're then in.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.180]   For example, indebtedness.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:42.420]   It's politically desirable for those
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.740]   to borrow money and spend,
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.300]   because their constituencies only look at what they get,
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.820]   and when they get a lot,
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.140]   they don't pay attention to the balance sheet
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.180]   and how much debt is on the books.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.660]   So it's always better to borrow, spend,
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.860]   and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.820]   And so you inherit a lot.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.440]   You inherited, as a new president enters in,
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.380]   or new legislators, they have a lot of debt,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.300]   they have a broken-down infrastructure,
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.820]   they don't have enough money to fix that,
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.380]   and so that's the lay of the land
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.660]   that the prior generations put you in,
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.180]   and there you are.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.640]   And so that's right.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.900]   It's difficult, because when you start to think,
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.380]   okay, what's healthy?
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.960]   Well, earn more than you spend.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.660]   Well, that's not so easy,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.020]   because what does that mean?
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.460]   Go earn more?
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.860]   I mean, okay, that's not so easy.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.300]   Spend less?
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.100]   That isn't gonna work.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.680]   So now what do you do?
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.260]   Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize,
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.720]   and that's why it's classic.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.820]   So yes, that's why these cycles occur,
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.780]   because what has created before,
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.460]   what happened before created the lay of the land
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.460]   that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.780]   - So what can great leaders do in this moment?
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.580]   I mean, maybe, my sense is leadership is crucial here.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.260]   So for example, to do very large projects
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.300]   that invest in the education system,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.980]   that sort of try to fix the fundamentals,
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.980]   or maybe invest more and more into the innovation
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.540]   and the development of new technologies and so on.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.940]   It feels like that just doesn't happen organically.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.740]   So you have to have strong leaders
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.740]   that convince the populace of the importance of these ideas.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.680]   - Well, I completely agree with your list.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.440]   What we have is a situation where everybody
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.260]   has their opinions, and they have to sort of
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.740]   get them exactly right, and they all fight with each other
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.360]   about whether their opinions.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.080]   so that we don't, and we get over our differences.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.320]   I would have a bipartisan cabinet.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   I would draw upon members of both parties,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.540]   the moderates, who are going to be able to work together.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.360]   So as then we have one country,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.840]   and then we deal with those in a means
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.200]   that works for the majority of the people
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.480]   in the middle rather than the polarity.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.280]   So I would say that's of paramount importance
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.580]   because we have the resources.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:50.040]   Wealth, real wealth, and science and everything
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.480]   has never been better than it is.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.660]   But the notion is that it has to work
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.760]   for the majority of people,
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.360]   and we have to keep it being productive.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.800]   work together so that they increase the size of the pie
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.680]   and they create broad-based prosperity.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   So that is of paramount importance.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.920]   Whatever they do, if they do it that way,
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.320]   I can say I'm happy about because that other alternative
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.820]   is the really scary alternative.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:31.600]   - The scary alternative,
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.880]   the different ways it has evolved throughout history,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.000]   some of it has led to wars.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.760]   What are the future trajectories
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.440]   that lead to a potential war with China?
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.960]   Cold War or Hot War?
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.280]   Is this something you think about?
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   Is this something you're worried about?
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.360]   - Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.480]   So the war with China,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.860]   as I say, there are five kinds of wars.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.000]   There's a trade war, technology war,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.600]   geopolitical influence war, capital war,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.320]   and military war.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.760]   As far as military war goes,
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.940]   I think it's only a Taiwan issue,
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.520]   but that's a big issue.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.800]   And we could talk about that for a minute.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.060]   But those others, they'll be rough competitions,
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.640]   and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.440]   That's what that war looks like.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.180]   Taiwan has been, for a long time,
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.500]   a sovereignty issue to China.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.280]   And it has its roots in what's called
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.140]   the 100 Years of Humiliation.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.720]   From the 1840s to 1949,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.840]   foreign powers came in, took advantage of China.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.500]   They had the Opium Wars and such times.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.040]   And that represented the 100 Years of Humiliation.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   And Taiwan represents, is their sovereignty
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   and their important thing.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.640]   And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.420]   there was an agreement that there is one China,
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.580]   and Taiwan is part of China,
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.580]   and that there would be peaceful reunification.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.480]   The peaceful reunification hasn't happened.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.960]   And in their view, that's a very big issue.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.520]   And so it's a big contentious issue.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.820]   And that could produce a military war,
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.440]   could produce a military accident.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's a very tense situation.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.840]   And if we had a military war, God help us,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.680]   because of the capacity in all different new ways
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.440]   to inflict harm on each other.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.720]   But anyway, that's that.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.720]   If you don't have that military war,
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.520]   you'll have the competition between
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.360]   those other kinds of wars,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:11.360]   and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.720]   - Where do you put cyber war within the five?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.440]   - Well, cyber war is a military war.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.040]   I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're referring to
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.600]   is that which is used to inflict pain
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.800]   on the other party through cyber.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.740]   So cyber wars, you'll see cyber war.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.920]   You could see space war.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.420]   You can see drone warfare.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:40.240]   New types of warfare, not just the traditional
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.720]   and nuclear type of warfare.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.480]   But you could see any of the above.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.880]   - What are the defining characteristics?
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.720]   What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.920]   the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.280]   - His father was a early leader.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:06.720]   He was himself, in the Cultural Revolution at times,
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.300]   treated brutally.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.800]   And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.480]   And he came up through the ranks,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.260]   and is a very intelligent man.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.800]   When he first came to power, as you know,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.160]   they have two five-year terms,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.200]   and we're now coming to the end of the second
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.760]   of those five-year terms.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.000]   When he first came to power,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.880]   he felt that there should be a lot of reform,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.620]   and reform meant moving to much more of a market,
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.380]   an open economy.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.120]   When that happened, him coming in,
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.960]   I had some contact with economic policy makers,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.320]   but in the circumstances then,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.840]   were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.800]   and local governments with implied government guarantees.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.080]   And so there was not control of that,
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   and the movement to a more of a market economy.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.760]   And the development of markets was a primary.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.900]   And also, the dealing with the corruption issue.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.120]   There was a lot of corruption prior to that,
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.480]   and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.600]   So that became the primary objective.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   And then as time progressed over those 10 years,
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   there was a lot of changing in the world,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.820]   their financial circumstances,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.920]   opening many, many other markets.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.460]   And they particularly getting money
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.200]   to small and medium-sized enterprises,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.960]   and developing a lending system,
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.340]   and then establishing controls on it.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.340]   So right now, there's a vibrant capital markets.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:07.880]   You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.280]   you can become a billionaire in the capital markets.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.680]   And they developed the markets
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.400]   to be the second largest capital markets.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.280]   At the same time, they had to deal
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.720]   with their rising debt issue,
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.680]   which they began to deal with really about four years ago,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.120]   when the second term began.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:40.560]   And then Liu He became the vice premier,
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.360]   responsible for that, and to deal with those issues.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.920]   So you see right now that what's happening
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.180]   is the dealing with the real estate bubble.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.000]   There was a development in real estate, a bubble,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.040]   which produced a lot of unproductive lending.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:05.040]   And Xi Jinping said, "Houses are meant to live in,
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.280]   "not to speculate on."
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.880]   And so that was wasteful.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.960]   So they established what they call three red lines,
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.940]   which are financial ratios,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.400]   that the property developers had to live within.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.880]   And that is then causing the adjustments
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.280]   that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.680]   because whenever there's bankruptcies and so on,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.160]   most in the public think, okay, that's a problem.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.320]   It's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.460]   and bad practices.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.120]   And so that's what's going on.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.640]   So that's, let's say, economically.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   At the same time, there is the changing relationships,
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.540]   the changing world order, the changing relationships
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.180]   with the United States and other countries,
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.980]   which is becoming much less cooperative
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.640]   and much more warlike, much more confrontational.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.820]   Those two things, the domestic debt problem
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:11.200]   and the investing, has led to what's called core,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.180]   what they call core leadership,
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.220]   which means a leadership more around him
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   that is less challenging,
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.440]   because they believe in history
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.380]   that during very difficult times,
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.880]   a more centrally controlled decision-making process
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.780]   lends itself better than to a more fragmented
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.060]   political contentious project.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.400]   And that's basically what's going on now.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.080]   - You said it very eloquently,
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.620]   but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:50.120]   and there's a lot of centralized control.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   - That characterization is much more black and white
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.640]   than it really is.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.380]   - But it leans towards that direction.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.320]   - Like, for example, of the standing members
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.180]   of the Politburo, four are more allied to him,
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.500]   three are less so.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.600]   You have to understand that it's kind of
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.680]   a collective leadership at the top.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.640]   And then, of course, there's just jockeying for power
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   in a highly political sense at the top.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.000]   But no one leader can be successful
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.240]   against all those powers at the top.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.920]   So it's very politically negotiating.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.600]   It's very much more like if you put in the United States
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.540]   the Democrats and the Republicans
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.380]   and they had to be in the same government
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:45.180]   and they work it out, it's kind of something like that.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.760]   And so that's that struggle, but it's an internal struggle.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.060]   - Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.300]   at the founding of the United States?
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.340]   When then, now we're talking about it at the context
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.500]   of China, the freedom of speech, freedoms.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.620]   What China is doing with the central management
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:08.520]   of a lot of things, it's enabling a lot of growth,
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.880]   but it's also limiting people on the very basic level
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.760]   in terms of freedom, the kind of freedom
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.400]   that I think can lead to entrepreneurship,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.880]   to starting new businesses, to having big dreams
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   and chasing those dreams and then creating
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.080]   totally new things in whatever the space,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.040]   maybe in technology, in business, in whatever.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.440]   How important is that as a metric for society?
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.120]   - Well, they have a view which is the idea of a dialectic,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.400]   which means that two things are at,
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.520]   that everything comes with pros and cons
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.580]   and two opposites exist.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.140]   And you want the benefits of those two opposites
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.960]   and how do you deal with the benefits
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.040]   of those two opposites?
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.420]   So let's say you want the capital markets
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.060]   because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.300]   who are motivated, they build fortunes
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.860]   and that drives an economy to do very well.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:12.780]   And at the same time, it produces the other problems,
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.940]   the wealth gaps, the other problems,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.460]   then the debt cycle that we're talking about and so on.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:23.340]   And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.580]   and the market economy and the capital markets?
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:32.580]   And he famously said, "It doesn't matter if it's a white cat
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.380]   "or a black cat, just as long as it catches mice."
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.660]   In other words, if it works in making the country richer,
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.300]   then that becomes the objective
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.660]   and then they move that along.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.520]   So there are these conflicts.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:51.440]   And one of the leaders described it to me as follows
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.960]   because it's confusion and it goes back
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.720]   over a period of time.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.780]   There's a hierarchy and it's an extension
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.320]   of the family, he described it.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   And he said, "The United States is a country of individuals
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.380]   "and individualism."
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:14.700]   And that is its vibrancy that we see.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.660]   The individual rights to speak up,
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.460]   the individual protection of the individual,
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.580]   individual property rights and all of those things
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.300]   is of paramount importance.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.940]   And we build our organization,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.140]   that's why democracy is from the bottom up
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.300]   or even a company will get together
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.540]   and will be partners to prosper together.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.500]   That is the American approach.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.420]   He was describing that in China,
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.900]   it's an extension of the Confucian family, essentially.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.400]   And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.080]   And so what they think about is the common good,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.440]   not the individualism.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.120]   So for example, if they want a high-speed rail
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.160]   to go from one place to another,
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.760]   and that's best in the common good,
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.720]   then the individual protections that would stand
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.700]   in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.240]   So that notion of controlling.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   So for example, what they're doing with video games,
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.240]   they control what type of video games
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.760]   and how many hours a day kids can be on video games
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.720]   operating in that way,
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.000]   because they believe that that's good for the society
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.800]   and that's very controlling.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.880]   In the United States, I think probably most parents
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.160]   would say, leave it to me,
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.360]   and it's a matter between me and my kids.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.680]   The same thing has to do with data.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.360]   In other words, in the United States, who controls the data?
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.380]   Does the company control the data?
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.040]   Do you individually control the data?
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.640]   And so the inclination would be to figure that out,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.680]   but nobody would say that the government
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.480]   is going to control the data
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.820]   because of our inclination of really anti-government control.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.240]   In China, it would be that the government
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.920]   will control the data
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.960]   because that's going to be best for the society,
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.380]   and it depends who you trust,
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.740]   but that's, so that difference in philosophy
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.680]   is very much at the heart of that.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.160]   As far as your question in terms of effectiveness,
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.960]   it really is, in China's case,
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.160]   it's how you balance the things, right?
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.040]   So what they're attempting to do
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.720]   is to create a lot of freedom and creativity
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:49.000]   in areas that are not political, let's say,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.880]   and so you see a lot of entrepreneurship,
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.980]   you see a lot of product development,
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.660]   you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.940]   So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.740]   is an old stereotype,
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.260]   but where there's a lot of creativity certainly happening,
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.940]   and the system can work well
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.300]   if they can achieve that kind of balance.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.100]   It's proven to have worked well.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.340]   Since I started going there in 1984,
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.140]   per capita income, real per capita income,
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.200]   has increased by 26 times.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.960]   The longevity rate has increased by 10 years.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.260]   The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1%
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.420]   in terms of basics like starvation and things.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.740]   And if you read history, Plato's Republic,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.400]   he talks about the cycles, democracy and autocratic
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.240]   and the benevolent despot and all of that.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.360]   Each has their own vulnerability.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.700]   The vulnerability of democracy,
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.820]   which has been a remarkable, remarkable system,
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.040]   and I don't have to extol the benefits of it,
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.980]   but the vulnerability of it has always been
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:18.640]   In World War II, four democracies
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.960]   chose to be autocracies
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   because there was internal disorder,
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.920]   and there was the belief,
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.200]   will somebody bring about order
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.640]   and get control of the situation?
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   That was in Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.160]   There were parliamentary systems
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.840]   that turned themselves over to that.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   So both systems have vulnerabilities.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.300]   I think the main thing that we need to think about
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.800]   is those vulnerabilities.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.340]   Democracy is an amazing system
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:03.340]   because the adherence to the rules and the system
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.660]   and the checks and balances is quite amazing,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.480]   and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.060]   But there has to be the respect of the rules.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.060]   And when you see something like
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:22.500]   they will not accept elections
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.640]   or they will not accept rules,
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.700]   history has shown when the causes that people are behind
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.380]   are more important to them than the system,
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.440]   the system is in jeopardy.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.300]   So we have a situation that's very much like that
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:42.540]   in terms of, let's say, the 2024 elections.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.780]   I believe that there's a very high chance
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.780]   that neither side will accept losing, for example.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:56.300]   And so we have that kind of a situation.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:01.300]   So one would hope that one could rise above the disagreements
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:06.820]   and rely on the system for resolving disagreements
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.740]   because if that doesn't happen, then we have our own chaos.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:16.820]   - So the kind of the trend that started in 2020,
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:21.820]   or I mean, I suppose it's been there, it's been growing.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.300]   One representation of this internal disorder
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.460]   has been the growing trend of being skeptical
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.700]   about the results of the election.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.700]   - Well, it started before that.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.140]   There was the emergence of populism
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:39.200]   before President Trump was elected.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.340]   He was basically elected as a populist
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.840]   because there was a large percentage of the population
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.700]   that felt that the system didn't work for them.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.300]   And he tapped into that, and he was largely elected
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.700]   as a populist leader, first populist leader
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.460]   in a developed country.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:04.240]   And so populism began then.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.460]   And that was a battle of one group against the other group.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.700]   And so since then, it's been like that,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.640]   and it continued to grow.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:22.980]   - You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy,
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.660]   the internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.500]   What's the vulnerability of a system like China?
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.500]   Maybe one way to say is put China aside
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.000]   and look at history, look at Soviet Union.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.920]   What's the vulnerability of a communist-type system?
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   - Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.000]   depending on how much autocracy.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.560]   Is that it lacks flexibility.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.120]   It lacks the ability,
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.600]   but I should deal with them differently.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.200]   In other words, there's the economic system.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.300]   So communism or socialism has to be done in a way
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.080]   where you can threaten productivity.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:20.560]   Capitalism has, and what I mean by that,
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:24.760]   I mean free markets and capital markets
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.520]   have been an effective way of allocating resources
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.520]   and also creating the incentives and the resources,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.640]   providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.480]   And so if I compare that, what the Chinese have done
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.560]   to a large extent is to recognize that,
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.980]   and have made a move, that's why the seeming dialectic
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.740]   or the conflict between those two things exist.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.560]   But anyway, that's it.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.860]   As far as an autocratic system,
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:03.820]   rather than one man, one vote from the population up,
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:07.340]   the risks of the autocratic system
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.380]   is that there's enough discontent that arises,
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:16.620]   that the system doesn't have the flexibility,
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.560]   and that rather than bending, it breaks.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.180]   That's the big risk.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.460]   The notion of trying to control a population
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:31.460]   if there's that, rather than giving it the flexibility.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:36.220]   So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.420]   - What's the human, 'cause you mentioned
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:42.500]   the top gets bigger with empires,
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.820]   and you start taking things for granted.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.360]   Is some of this just human nature?
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.360]   So the concern with China, with autocratic nations,
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.620]   was that fundamentally at the individual level,
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.500]   the humans involved at the top,
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.640]   they start becoming, they're starting to lose touch
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.480]   with the reality in a way that no longer makes them,
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.940]   I guess that's the representation,
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.020]   the flexibility that you're referring to.
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:21.220]   - Well, I mean, in a democracy, you could change.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.620]   You can go as far left or as far right.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.820]   You can change the leaders easily.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.740]   And so the people don't become,
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.300]   they pretty much only have themselves to blame.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.720]   And one of the problems of that
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.020]   is they may not choose the best leaders,
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.380]   but they have that flexibility.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:46.220]   So vote, and you get what you wanted.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.060]   In the case of the autocratic, let's say, leaders,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.080]   and then the movement from democracies to autocracies,
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.460]   what you see, normally that movement,
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.580]   is that one of the systems is not working.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.980]   Let's say the democracy is not effectively,
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.520]   everybody's arguing with each other
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.940]   and nobody's getting anything done.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.340]   And like Mussolini, the trains are not running on time.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.280]   And that would be the example.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.580]   Geez, this place has gotten chaotic.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.700]   Will somebody get to control?
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.500]   And then you get the autocratic,
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.540]   and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:29.020]   And then you follow those kinds of orders.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.660]   And it's like maybe a CEO in a powerful company
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.580]   ordering around, and that could work well
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.380]   or it could work badly.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:40.820]   Most companies are run as,
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.140]   like autocracies, in a sense.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.020]   There's the hierarchy and the command economy
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.640]   and that kind of thing.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.700]   And that can work well or not,
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.700]   but then quite often when you get the populist autocratic,
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.380]   their personality is something that they wanna fight,
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.920]   and they become more nationalistic,
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.880]   and they tend to become more militaristic.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.660]   And human nature, at that stage,
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.200]   lends itself to fighting.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   There's an arc here that when we think of a country
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.760]   and we say we, and we think of a country,
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.720]   it's not true, it's not like that.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.040]   There are individuals who change.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   One generation dies and another generation comes along.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.980]   And one of those arcs is that
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.860]   the ones who have been through war
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.640]   don't wanna go to war
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.840]   and are more happily willing to abide
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.980]   by whatever the rules are.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.920]   As you get farther along into that cycle
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.440]   and you get a new generation
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars,
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.600]   then they want to fight.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.840]   And so you're seeing right now
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.840]   the emergent of fight for right.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.960]   And what that means is you see it internally.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:13.220]   Fight, where are you, and fight for that thing.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.880]   And they mean fight.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.600]   And then into externally, fight.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.840]   Are you going to be the strong one who will fight and win?
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.040]   And that develops on both sides, this fight and win.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.280]   And each side is cheering each other on into a war.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.720]   But that comes by those who really have not experienced war
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.580]   because it comes in their part of their lifetime.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.640]   - Humans are fascinating.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.960]   - Humans are fascinating.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.720]   And by the way, human nature has not changed
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.240]   over the thousands of years.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.000]   So it's so interesting 'cause like in doing this study,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.080]   and it comes across in the study,
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.780]   it's like watching the same movie over and over again.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:02.600]   You see the arc and you see it happen over and over again.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.720]   The only things that seem to change
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.640]   are the clothes people wear and the technologies they use.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.880]   (laughing)
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.920]   - Yeah, and then somebody probably will disagree
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.760]   with you about the clothes.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.320]   Maybe there's also cycles within fashions.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.120]   Maybe we're not even creative there.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:23.960]   What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.400]   What do you think about Putin as a leader,
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.560]   as a human being on this world stage
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.400]   within the context of the cycles of empires
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.880]   that you think about?
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.640]   - Well, Putin came to power
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.240]   at the failure of Russia's last order.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.620]   So there was the end of communism,
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:48.000]   and there was the development of the market economy,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.180]   the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:56.880]   And at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin,
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:03.240]   who was an alcoholic and had problems managing,
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.280]   and was put into power.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.720]   And the conditions in the Russia were,
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.560]   there was anarchy, there was no money.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.560]   It had the classic end of cycle ingredients.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.680]   It was broke, it was people were fighting with each other,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:23.200]   it was in the anarchy, and that's when he came to power.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.600]   And there were not institutions.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.160]   The whole thing had collapsed.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.000]   And it was not effective ministry of education,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.100]   ministry of anything.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:39.200]   And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability,
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:43.760]   and they needed a democracy,
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.600]   and they needed the improvement of capital markets.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.160]   So he's been in that position as a,
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:59.480]   I guess I would call him a semi-autocratic leader,
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.400]   in that from all indications,
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.780]   he would respect the democracy,
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.520]   and he's very popular.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.840]   He's won democratic elections
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.600]   because he's been a strong leader,
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   and he's brought peace and stability to the Soviet,
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.320]   to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   And he's a strong leader in pursuit of the,
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   the country's interests in a way where Russia
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.120]   is not a significant economic power,
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.340]   but it is a significant military power.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.880]   So the issues, and then there's a strong alliance
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.720]   between Russia and China now.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.900]   So that's kind of the lay of the land.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.380]   And then there are sensitivities.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.000]   The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.200]   because of there are a lot of Russians
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.980]   who live in the Ukraine,
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.820]   and there's also the issue of NATO on their border.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.600]   So there are those kinds of things,
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.000]   and he has military power,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.700]   and he has a strong alliance with China.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.640]   And I guess that's my best summary
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.240]   of what his position is.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.220]   Strong leader, popular.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:35.380]   These are not subjective interpretations.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.820]   These are objective interpretations.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.980]   - Yeah, it's interesting, just in this conversation,
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.940]   you're not sort of doing the usual criticism
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.460]   of any one particular system.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.740]   You're looking at these systems
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.660]   from the perspective of history.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.960]   You're just describing how they work.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.460]   It's oftentimes when you talk about what Russia is today
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.380]   or what the Soviet Union was or what China is today
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.780]   is you start to criticize,
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.260]   well, they do this kind of censorship
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.540]   or they do this kind of,
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.200]   they limit freedoms in this kind of way.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.740]   But you're just kind of describing this as a nation
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:13.320]   with ideas what they think is right.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   This is how they hope to get it to work.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.540]   This is why it's working.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.260]   This is what's not working.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.380]   Here's metrics that show that it's not working.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.780]   I think that's a refreshing way to think about it.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.700]   It's easy, though.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.980]   I mean, you got some criticism saying
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.080]   that I think China's a strict parent.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.220]   Some people criticize these countries for doing,
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.020]   so for violating human rights.
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.980]   I suppose there's some people that criticize
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.100]   the United States for violating human rights.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:49.100]   But what are your thoughts on the world stage today
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.780]   about some of the behaviors it has governed
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.340]   in terms of respecting the rights,
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.380]   the basic rights of human beings?
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.380]   - You described accurately how I just try to look at things
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:08.460]   in a non, I don't want to impute my values on anybody.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:14.020]   I mean, there are intolerable things,
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.780]   so I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:20.340]   But one of the great things of being an American here
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.860]   is that I grew up with all different nationalities
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.060]   having all different points of view
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.700]   and all different religions
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.500]   and all different ways of operating.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:35.500]   And I've come to treasure the fact that that is,
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.000]   you know, what's their business is their business.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.180]   And then the question is, where do you cross the line
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.100]   under what circumstances that others
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.740]   have got to do it my way.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.460]   And then when you do it internationally,
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.460]   the issue of what is a sovereign state,
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.060]   you know, which, as I say, in the piece of Westphalia,
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   and you have borders, and then when do you cross the line,
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.740]   that my way of doing things
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.500]   has got to be their way of doing things,
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.180]   or what are the various rights?
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.540]   And so that's a very delicate question,
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.020]   or a very difficult question.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:16.260]   And we all have responsibilities to different parties,
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.980]   and we all have different levels of knowledge
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.240]   about those particular things.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.600]   So for example, as an international investor,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.320]   I have a responsibility to my investors.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.120]   Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.580]   of how did they run that.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.580]   So if you're taking Nike or Snickers and so on,
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:43.520]   and Americans can decide whether they wanna buy
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.280]   Chinese products or not buy Chinese products,
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.460]   we are all faced with those types of choices.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.420]   So you have what do you wanna do in your constituency,
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.900]   and you have your choices.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.340]   And then beyond that, in many cases,
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.100]   the issues are quite complex,
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.340]   like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:07.340]   So, and then I believe that if you disconnect it,
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:13.740]   if all those entities, like myself, the businesses,
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.860]   doing business with China, disconnected,
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.460]   I think that that would be disastrous,
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.260]   economically disastrous, and it would also be,
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:29.260]   reduce the understanding that comes from working together,
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.500]   that helps to reduce wars.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.780]   And so these are all complicated.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.840]   So what we do is, and who makes it,
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.660]   my opinion matters the most.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.780]   Why should it be my opinion that matters the most
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.260]   in making that decision?
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.780]   So I largely look at the government guidance
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.340]   that I get not only from my own government,
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.260]   but from the other governments, and I follow the rules.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.420]   I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.620]   and we wanna do that in the best way
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.020]   to provide the diversified portfolio,
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.820]   and we sort of need that.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.420]   Every one of those countries has similar complexities.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.820]   There are always one issue or another,
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.460]   and there's only so much that we really understand
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.700]   about all of those issues.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.020]   So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.460]   - Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.460]   to the culture of the place, the way things are done.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.020]   You don't necessarily,
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:30.460]   the way you heal relationships between nations,
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.940]   like you said, you work together,
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:36.080]   and that requires kind of,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.220]   to listen maybe more than you talk,
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.500]   and I think people in the public sphere
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.540]   talk a lot about China without really listening,
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.940]   without understanding much about China, without,
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.380]   one of the things that makes me really sad
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.460]   because I know how to speak Russian,
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:56.720]   and I know how much is lost in translation,
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.220]   it makes me sad that I'll never really get to know
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.700]   the Chinese culture, because,
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.740]   like I'll never really get to know the language,
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:08.020]   the literature, the, just talk to regular people.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.620]   It's not just the government or officials or scientists,
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.820]   just regular folks, get the culture.
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.020]   I think if you don't understand the culture,
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.700]   just the basics of the human nature,
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.060]   what people love about their country, about their family,
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.340]   what kind of hopes they have,
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.500]   what kind of values they have,
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.620]   without that, you're not gonna be able to
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:34.020]   fully connect with them,
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.900]   and you have to do that first,
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.900]   to have a chance of building a good world.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.100]   - I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.780]   I was very lucky because, as I say,
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:47.820]   since 1984, so for more than half of my life,
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:51.060]   I've been going there, and the common people,
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.860]   and all sorts of people, and I've got to meet them.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.260]   I don't speak the language,
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.820]   but a combination of through translators
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.980]   or them speaking English and being in situations,
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.580]   I had my son go to school, a local school,
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.820]   and we developed those kinds of understandings.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.820]   I think that, but the not wanting
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.860]   to know the other perspective
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.100]   is the thing that's most scary.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.380]   Like, I'm right now in the middle,
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:30.700]   and all I wanna try to do is to help mutual understanding.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:34.740]   You're right, if there were questions probing me,
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.800]   asking me, what is it?
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.460]   I'm not on one side or another.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.900]   I don't wanna be on one side or another.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.660]   I believe that each has their right within there
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.020]   to approach their different culture in their own way.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.940]   So many ways, you gave an example.
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:53.700]   If they're not doing harm to others.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:59.780]   But that issue of trying to understand
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.260]   is so much better.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.300]   That doesn't mean agree with.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:11.740]   If you are wanting to out-clever and out-compete somebody,
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:17.020]   it still pays to understand what they're thinking.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.500]   So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.220]   even if you wanna go to war with them,
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.300]   that understanding is the best thing to have.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.140]   What we have now is a situation
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.620]   in which there's an enemy mentality,
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:35.500]   and that means that anything that serves,
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.820]   seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.600]   seems to mistakenly create the notion
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.380]   of I'm on their side in a war.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.740]   And that's kind of a dangerous thing
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.920]   because there's a momentum here to fight.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.660]   - Henry Kissinger praises your new book,
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.660]   and you thank him in it in the dedication.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.700]   What's your relationship like with him?
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.560]   What makes him interesting?
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.260]   Maybe what makes him controversial?
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.780]   What makes him such a central figure in history?
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:08.060]   - First, most importantly,
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:13.060]   he's unique about seeing things through all the other's eyes.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:18.060]   So if you were, it's like there's a chess game.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.920]   I mean, I think geopolitics is like a chess game,
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.660]   but with multiple chess players playing the same game.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.100]   So imagine there are six people around
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.740]   playing the chess game, and he could sit in each seat,
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.540]   and he could know how they see it, okay,
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.340]   and see it in a calm way of how they see it.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.780]   He's unique in that way.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.100]   He's 98 years old, and he's equally able to do that.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.500]   And he has a background in which he's a historian,
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.260]   so he really understands history super terrifically.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.100]   He doesn't understand economic history as much,
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.820]   so that's why, to some extent,
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.380]   we enjoy having the conversation,
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.580]   'cause he's interested in the economic piece
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.740]   he doesn't know, and I'm so interested
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:15.060]   in the geopolitical piece that I don't know as well.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.920]   But anyway, he's able to do that,
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.500]   but not only a historian, but a practitioner.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   So when you go from an academic to a practitioner
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.860]   who has that talent to see things through others' eyes
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.220]   in an objective way and to be strategic
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.940]   rather than just tactical, that's a very special person,
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.040]   and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.360]   - Yeah, he's lived a fascinating life.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.820]   Just all of the world events he's been involved in
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.780]   is fascinating, and like you said,
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.460]   that's such an interesting skill to have,
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.700]   to consider what are the concerns, the hope,
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.540]   the dreams, the fears of all the people at the table.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.240]   What are they thinking?
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.260]   I find that people don't, once again,
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.940]   don't do that enough when it's the obvious thing
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.060]   you should be doing, whether it's business deals
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:14.060]   or political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:18.060]   I'm often surprised, again, sorry to go to the Russian thing
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   because I hear Putin talk in Russian,
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.260]   and you start to infer certain intentions,
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:29.380]   like not the trivial stuff, like the human being.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:32.980]   What is that human being hoping for himself,
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:36.060]   for his country, for his close inner circle,
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.420]   for the bigger, and I just see that
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.420]   that's often just lost in translation.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   I just see American leaders talking to Putin,
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.780]   and it's just not, there's not a connection.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.960]   - Absolutely, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation,
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.540]   or even reading a speech, and you see then it reported,
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:10.580]   inevitably, the reporter picks some headline characterization
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:16.380]   that has very little to do with what was really happening,
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.080]   but might be a headline grabber
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.980]   that's at some kind of distortion,
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.860]   and there's a lack of understanding
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.180]   of really what's going on.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.580]   - If it's okay, let me ask you a couple questions
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.820]   about cryptocurrency.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.700]   You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.900]   What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today,
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.380]   its role in the global financial system,
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.420]   and just in human society in general?
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:44.340]   - Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   is one of the things that has influenced changes,
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.360]   in my view.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.660]   It has proven itself something like 10, 11 years ago.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:59.900]   Imagine the programming of this,
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.820]   and here's, you throw it out, and that's the idea.
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.860]   It has not been hacked.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:09.700]   It has operated, it has built,
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:14.420]   it has come an amazing way over that 11 years
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:19.420]   to be maybe probably the most excited topic
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:23.420]   among a lot of people, and has been used,
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:28.420]   and now has obtained the status of having imputed value.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:35.260]   At the same time, it is one of those assets
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.480]   that is an alternative money.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.100]   I think we're entering an era
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:44.300]   where there's going to be a competition of monies
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.800]   because of the printing of fiat money,
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.900]   and the depreciated value.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.480]   There will be a competition of monies,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.620]   and Bitcoin is part of that competition,
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.900]   but there'll be many monies, not just crypto monies,
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.560]   but there'll be central bank crypto monies,
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.200]   but there'll be different kinds of monies.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.720]   And even monies are things that you buy and sell.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.740]   NFTs can become a money, a type of money.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.460]   You own it and it's an investment,
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:24.500]   and you could say I'd rather own it than own Bitcoin.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.260]   - Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs?
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.320]   - Not yet. - Okay.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.780]   - But only just because,
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:36.940]   I definitely want to buy NFTs to just experience them.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.740]   Like I think I should produce one, and I should--
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:43.860]   - I should have asked that, have you minted an NFT?
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.740]   You probably should, just to know what it's like.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.640]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.240]   This stuff is happening.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.980]   This stuff is real, okay, and how it operates.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.100]   But like all new real things,
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.300]   some are gonna go and some are gonna,
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.720]   it's like in the internet in the year 2000,
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.340]   pets.com could have been a great,
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.340]   but maybe pets.com doesn't make it, and who knows.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.020]   That's the beauty of the competitive system,
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.300]   that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.460]   and some things will be trashed.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.820]   But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.880]   of what is an alternative money?
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.060]   A money has two purposes, a medium of exchange
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.200]   and a storehold of wealth.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.740]   And we are looking for, and it's portable.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:38.080]   And it's best if it's recognized in other countries.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:41.880]   So gold is one of those.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.600]   So I look at it as an alternative gold,
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.680]   but I look at a number of things as an alternative gold.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.880]   And I think that, and gold is still my favorite
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.960]   because of certain qualities.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.560]   For example, you can't trace it.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.420]   In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it,
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.100]   where it's going and so on.
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.480]   Governments can have that ability to trace it and so on.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.820]   A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.020]   I think not connected has benefits,
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.300]   particularly in a world where maybe connections
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.680]   can be more risky.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:24.760]   And then also gold has been for many thousands of years
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.400]   universally recognized as a source of money.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.400]   And central banks, it's the third largest source of money
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.500]   in central bank reserves.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.360]   And I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.440]   those types of purposes and so on.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.060]   So for various reasons, I prefer gold to the other.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.920]   But it's a little bit part of my mix.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.060]   - But then you look at it, it hit, I think,
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.800]   69,000 this year is the high Bitcoin hit.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.680]   Do you think it's possible, you mentioned gold,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.280]   do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers,
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.400]   like one million that some people talk about?
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   - I don't think that's possible
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.480]   because the way I look at it is
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.440]   there's a certain amount of
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.840]   a certain amount of it.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.080]   And there's a certain amount of gold.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.820]   I'll use gold as a benchmark.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:26.360]   The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.760]   Total crypto is about 2.2 trillion.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.680]   But let's say Bitcoin, it's $1 trillion.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:37.760]   If you take the amount of money that is in gold
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.400]   that is not used for jewelry purposes
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.020]   and not used by central banks,
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.380]   and I assume Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.140]   or central bank purposes,
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.180]   that amount in gold is about $5 trillion.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:59.160]   So right now, if you were to have a portfolio
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.980]   that has gold and crypto, gold and Bitcoin,
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.540]   it's worth about 20% of the value of gold.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:11.820]   Do I think it's going to be worth more than gold?
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.220]   In terms of that mix,
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.900]   I don't think it'll be worth more than gold.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.340]   But let's say it became worth as much as gold.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.740]   I don't believe it will be.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:25.660]   I think that 20% sounds kind of about right.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.000]   I really don't know what the right answer is.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.660]   And then there's the question of
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:33.860]   what is all of that pool of money
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.220]   that let's say gold and gold equivalents
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.600]   relative to everything else?
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.100]   Does it go from, you know, let's call it
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.740]   six, seven, eight trillion to 16 trillion?
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.140]   Maybe it could double.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.740]   It depends what it is in the world environment.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.760]   But basically, if you use gold as a measure,
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.260]   it just makes no sense
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:00.440]   that it's going to be used that much more.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.760]   Am I sure about that?
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.360]   I'm not sure about anything.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.940]   But logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.700]   on its price in relationship to
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.280]   other things that are like it.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.860]   - Let me ask for your deep financial analysis
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.540]   on a very important issue.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:20.420]   I just talked a couple days ago with Elon Musk.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.740]   He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.780]   What are your thoughts about Dogecoin?
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:31.140]   And do you think it'll be the official currency?
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:35.180]   Maybe a reserve currency on the moon and on Mars?
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.580]   - My reaction is that's cute.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.940]   I remember Elon, when he first got,
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.540]   he first got his money from PayPal.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:45.500]   I think he said to me, it was,
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.180]   he got $180 million, $90 million,
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.500]   he decided to say, why aren't we going to outer space?
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:57.500]   And he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:01.540]   using Russian technology
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:06.340]   to put a plant
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:09.780]   and a watering can on the moon,
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:13.300]   or on Mars, I think it was.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.660]   And he said, first life on Mars,
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.300]   or first life on that,
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:23.820]   as an inspiring notion.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:27.320]   And so then there's always what's behind it.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.380]   I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.260]   to do other things behind it.
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.060]   And so I would take that as symbolic,
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.500]   and I'd be asking him what's behind it, what's next?
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.860]   - And I'm also just on the topic of Dogecoin and memecoin,
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:48.460]   and there's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.420]   that's really interesting about the way we communicate,
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.100]   what ideas become viral,
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:57.980]   or how to captivate people with ideas.
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.100]   There's something about taking things too seriously
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.860]   that somehow slows it all down, and it's interesting.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.740]   - You're right.
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.300]   - That's part of human nature somehow.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.720]   So humor is part of this whole thing.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:14.360]   You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.620]   And you have a fascinating--
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.260]   - Principles in particular.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.340]   - Principles.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.940]   And you have this really nice thing in your book
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.060]   where you actually, I mean, there's such a brilliant way,
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.980]   sorry, you have such a brilliant way of highlighting
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:33.500]   which parts are extra important, and you make 'em bold.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.700]   That's a brilliant idea.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.360]   Let me just ask the high-level question
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:41.360]   of what's a good system for taking notes?
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.540]   - Well, I find that almost everything happens
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.800]   over and over again.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:52.420]   And we're in the blizzard of these things happening.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.740]   And what I found is that if I'm making a decision
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:02.160]   that after I make the decision usually,
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.220]   or right at the time, if I pause and reflect,
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.800]   and I write my principle down, in other words,
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.460]   principle is sort of a recipe, what would I use to,
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.580]   how would I make that decision,
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.540]   and what are the criteria around it?
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:23.220]   I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clearer,
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.460]   and it applies to the next thing that comes along,
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.040]   it'll be that way.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.900]   Because everything happens over and over and over again.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:35.520]   And I think people make the mistake of looking at just one,
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.500]   like it's the first one, they have, I don't know,
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.120]   they have the first problem of this sort,
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.140]   or the first child, or whatever it is.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.760]   And this has been happening plenty of times.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.600]   And so if you have the principles,
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.660]   I found that that helped me think more clearly about it,
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:54.400]   and it helped me communicate better, like why.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.900]   And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so,
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.120]   that's what I've done.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.760]   I did it originally to communicate very well
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.880]   with the people I work with.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.840]   I set up my company, and it was very important
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.240]   to have good communication.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.520]   And then we could debate the principles,
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.000]   and so that's the process.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.680]   I urge people to do that.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.260]   There are many excellent decision makers,
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.480]   and I just wish that they wrote down their principles
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.580]   when this set, so for example,
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.680]   we're talking about Henry Kissinger,
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.360]   and his new book is gonna come out
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.860]   with a book on leadership.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.040]   And don't just describe the leaders,
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.160]   describe then what about them were the essential elements
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.480]   to make a good leader under what circumstances.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.020]   And so if we think about that,
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:51.760]   then also, then you begin to think in a principled way.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.200]   And then when you start to think in a principled way,
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.780]   life becomes, it's so much easier to make decisions,
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:01.020]   and it's so much less confusing,
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:04.140]   because it's like coming up on a species,
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:08.020]   and you say, okay, well, what species is it?
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.600]   Not just another, it's a thing.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.340]   No, what species is it,
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.880]   and how do I deal with that species effectively?
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.780]   And so that's what that is.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.300]   And so I encourage people to write it down.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.780]   I wish anybody who's successful
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.200]   wrote down their principles or their recipes
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.440]   for making those types of decisions.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.040]   - So the events of interest here
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.520]   happens over and over and over in similar ways,
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.920]   as you're looking for the patterns,
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.720]   and you're defining the process
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.420]   that's right to respond to those patterns,
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.920]   and you call that the principles,
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.480]   and that allows you to deal with the future effectively.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.800]   So that codifies the lessons from the past,
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.740]   to be able to deal with the future.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.560]   What advice do you have for young folks today?
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.500]   In high school, in college,
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:02.500]   thinking about how to have a career they can be proud of,
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.360]   or maybe have a life they can be proud of?
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   - Know yourself, follow your passion,
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.680]   make your work and passion the same thing,
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.320]   while considering the money part,
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:18.440]   'cause money will get you freedom and choice,
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.520]   and be able to make that.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.280]   But if you know yourself, feel the pull,
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.600]   and pursue that passion.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.020]   And along those lines, by the way,
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.740]   I found that using personality profile tests
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.220]   has been very helpful.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.580]   I've used those for about 25 years
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.940]   for people to help to understand themselves
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.920]   and understand each other.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   So I created a free one that is called Principles U.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:50.320]   It's online.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.220]   It's had remarkable, loving people who've taken it,
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:59.500]   learn about themselves, but also,
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.240]   you can put in somebody else,
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.120]   and it'll tell you about your relationship with them.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.820]   That's like 30 minutes, it's a quick discovery,
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.760]   but the main thing is to understand on your journey,
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.240]   your hero's journey,
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.140]   that you will have mistakes,
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.320]   and you will have weaknesses,
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   and to understand those, not fight those,
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.560]   because by understanding mistakes,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.080]   you will learn not to make mistakes again.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.040]   I have a principle, which is,
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.320]   pain plus reflection equals progress.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.340]   And so that reflection is important,
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.360]   to know yourself, know your pulls, know your weaknesses.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.920]   And when you also know your weaknesses,
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.920]   and the strengths of other people,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.480]   there are people who have strengths where you're weak,
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.640]   and you have strengths where they're weak,
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.260]   and to be able to work well together
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:02.260]   is the most effective way of achieving success.
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.020]   So yeah, it's that journey,
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:08.320]   and there's a life arc, and there's a journey,
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.360]   and you wanna make it the best that you can make it,
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.840]   and it has, it's like a video game.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.520]   You know, it has the challenges, and the obstacles,
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.920]   and the learning experiences, and the temptations,
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:26.140]   and all of that, and the maximizing learning
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.720]   to go where you wanna go to achieve the life you want
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.560]   is the most important.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.320]   That's kind of maybe a long-winded way of saying it,
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:39.320]   but to learn, I think, I'll try to say it simply.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.360]   There's a five-step process.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.360]   Step one is know your goals, know what you're going after.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.280]   You could have almost anything you want,
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.280]   but you can't have everything you want,
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.860]   and so you have to prioritize,
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.120]   and you move in that direction.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.380]   On the way to your goals,
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.120]   you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.680]   So identifying, no, step two is understanding your problems
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.720]   and your obstacles, identify them.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.760]   Step three is to diagnose them
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.900]   to get at the root cause of the problem,
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.560]   and that could be many root causes,
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.440]   but it could also be your weaknesses,
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:19.720]   or weaknesses of others,
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.160]   but you have to be objective about them.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.080]   Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four,
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.200]   which is to design a way to get around them,
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.960]   and then, after you have that design,
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.740]   you implement that design,
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.220]   so you have to follow through and do it,
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:42.940]   and you do that, and that will then produce its new results,
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.780]   which should be better results.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.700]   I call this kind of the looping process.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.260]   It's the evolutionary looping process,
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.380]   and you just keep doing that,
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.140]   and you learn over a period of time,
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:58.500]   and you move in the direction that you want.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.500]   - Last question, and you only have one minute to answer it.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.040]   You dedicate the book, quote,
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.680]   "To my grandchildren and those of their generation
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.920]   "who will be participants in the continuation of this story.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.760]   "May the force of evolution be with you."
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.480]   So let me ask, where is this force of evolution
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.520]   taking human civilization,
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.720]   and what in this story that evolution is writing
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.560]   gives you hope?
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.640]   - Evolution is a direction toward improvement,
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.120]   and the greatest force is
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:40.280]   man's capacity to adapt and invent,
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.960]   and so you see in the charts in the book,
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.640]   you see that this upward movement,
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.840]   life expectancy,
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:55.200]   health, all the things that we think are better,
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.160]   you see there's a chart,
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.320]   and it shows that over a period of time,
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:03.000]   and you barely see the downturns
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.020]   from depressions and wars in that.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.080]   That is the greatest power.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.080]   Man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution,
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.420]   and that's the greatest power,
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:20.080]   and that is what gives me justifiable hope.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.400]   - And a continuation of that, like we mentioned,
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.720]   with Elon, maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species,
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.600]   so not only will we keep creating amazing things
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.880]   here on Earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:36.640]   - My time horizon doesn't have me analyzing that yet,
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:41.180]   but I hope so, and I agree that
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.160]   that would be in the natural--
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.280]   - So I'm not gonna ask you
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.160]   for the best financial system on Mars.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.000]   I think we'll focus on Earth for now.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.720]   Ray, thank you so much for your brilliance,
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.260]   for the books you've written,
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.180]   for the works you've done,
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:54.600]   for the inspiration of millions,
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:57.400]   and thank you for spending your valuable time
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.480]   here with me today.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.000]   - Thank you.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.720]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:04.160]   To support this podcast,
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.900]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.000]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.480]   from Ray Dalio himself.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:14.000]   Every time you confront something painful,
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.200]   you are at a potentially important juncture in your life.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.360]   You have the opportunity to choose healthy
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   and painful truth, or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.820]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:43.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
