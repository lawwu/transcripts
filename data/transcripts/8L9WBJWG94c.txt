[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.280]   All right, our next question comes
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.160]   from Preet, who asks, why quarterly planning instead
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.800]   of monthly or annually?
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.360]   So in my philosophy of multiscale planning,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.720]   as you know, there's three scales--
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.040]   daily planning, weekly planning, quarterly planning.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.120]   So the quarterly plan you look at when you build your plan
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.840]   for each week, your weekly plan you
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.080]   look at when you build your time block plan for each day.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.960]   Why, as Preet asked, did I choose
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.520]   the scale of quarterly for that biggest scale plan?
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.040]   Well, it's because monthly is too small of a scale.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800]   It's too similar, I think, to the weekly plan.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.920]   There's not enough time in a month
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.020]   to really dig in and accomplish a project of non-trivial size
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.280]   for most things.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.480]   And so it overlaps the weekly plan
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   you're doing, I think, a little bit too much.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.600]   Annual planning is, on the other hand, too big of a scale.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.120]   I have a plan for the whole year.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.400]   I make the plan in January.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.680]   Now it's mid-February.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.880]   Am I really going to feel a lot of motivation,
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.960]   like I better get to work?
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.020]   Do I even know how to break something up
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.360]   over that big of a time frame?
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.240]   And if I sign a book contract on January 1,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880]   and just for the sake of this example,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.820]   let's say the book is due on December 31,
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.980]   what should I be doing February 1?
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.140]   I don't know.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.500]   Scale's too big.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.580]   So I like quarterly.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.020]   And if you're an academic, then call it semester.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.940]   But roughly the same thing.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.420]   I do it fall, winter, spring, summer usually.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.620]   So I do more like semesters.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.300]   But roughly that scale, three to four months.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.180]   I think that's the right scale.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.220]   You can lay in pretty big chunks of work.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.340]   And it really feels separate than the weekly plan,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.260]   because you're not at that level of granularity of like,
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.100]   well, there's a meeting in two Fridays from now,
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.500]   so let's not work on that day.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.740]   But it's still tractable.
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.340]   You're like, look, I have three or four months to do this,
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.460]   so I can be pretty clear about where I should be this month.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.820]   So that's where I came with that.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.140]   It's not set in stone, but it tends to be three or four
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.340]   months.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.260]   The three or four month granularity is about right
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.180]   for most people for that largest scale
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.460]   of multi-scale planning.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.200]   (upbeat music)
