[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.000]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.280]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.680]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.660]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.240]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.640]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.620]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.620]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.940]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.540]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.540]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.460]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.400]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.540]   Well, I have a question for you.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.180]   Does your family like to travel?
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.500]   What makes travel enjoyable for you?
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.220]   Are you explorers, people who like to try new things,
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.740]   embracing the habits and the culture
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.140]   of the place you're visiting?
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.860]   Or are you experiencers,
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.620]   loving to soak in the atmosphere of a new spot,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.060]   living like the natives?
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.060]   Are you documenters, people who like to observe and record
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.900]   and take lots of pictures of what you see
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.220]   as the similarities and differences
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.500]   between home and the travel location?
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.260]   Most of us, even self-proclaimed homebodies,
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.020]   like to see new places and try some new things.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.220]   Many of us are able to travel with our families
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.780]   to some extent, but lots of us have bucket lists
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.780]   of places to go, some so long or so ambitious
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.300]   we might actually never go to all of them.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.300]   Reading is a way to go farther without leaving home.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.620]   When I was young, and actually even now that I'm not young,
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.780]   I love visiting places, strange places sometimes
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.500]   through the books I read.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.780]   When I was little, I went to London and Paris and China
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.780]   and Jamaica and Russia.
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.060]   And most of the time, these locations
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.460]   were maybe not the point of the story I was reading,
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.460]   just the setting, but I learned about the places anyway
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.740]   and the people that lived there.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.180]   And I felt like my world got bigger.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.620]   Why not use reading aloud together
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.060]   as a way to travel the world this summer?
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.140]   Today, I want to read to you some stories from Africa
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.140]   from our Copper Lodge Library Edition, Ancient World Echoes.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.980]   Foundations families are gonna be learning about Africa
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.320]   this fall during cycle one.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   So today I want to read you three stories
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.100]   how we got the name spider tales,
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.900]   how wisdom became the property of the human race
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.900]   and an Aesop's fable, the shepherd boy and the wolf.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.820]   So you sit back and get ready to enjoy some stories.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.620]   And afterwards, I'm gonna give you a few suggestions,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.620]   some tips for conversation and activities from our stories.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.820]   First of all, from Ancient World Echoes,
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.780]   how we got the name spider tales.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.420]   In the olden days, all the stories which men told
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.420]   were stories of Onyankapon, the chief of the gods.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.340]   Spider, who was very conceited,
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.440]   wanted the stories to be told about him.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.500]   Accordingly, one day he went to Onyankapon
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.180]   and asked that in the future,
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.180]   all tales told by men might be Anansi stories
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.720]   instead of Onyankapon stories.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.300]   Onyankapon agreed on one condition.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.680]   He told spider or Anansi
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.980]   that he must bring him three things.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.980]   The first was a jar full of live bees.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.820]   The second was a boa constrictor and the third, a tiger.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.320]   Spider gave his promise.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.620]   He took an earthen vessel and set out for a place
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.460]   where he knew were numbers of bees.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.360]   When he came inside of the bees,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.680]   he began saying to himself,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.720]   "They will not be able to fill this jar."
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.960]   "Yes, they will be able."
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.580]   "No, they will not be able."
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.520]   Until the bees came up to him and said,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.500]   "What are you talking about, Mr. Anansi?"
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.260]   He thereupon explained to them what Onyankapon
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.020]   and he had had a great dispute.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.940]   Onyankapon had said the bees could not fly into the jar.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.300]   Anansi had said that they could.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.680]   The bees immediately declared
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.040]   that of course they could fly into the jar,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.840]   which they did at once.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.000]   As soon as they were safely inside,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Anansi sealed up the jar and sent it off to Onyankapon.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Next day, he took a long stick
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.720]   and set out in search of a boa constrictor.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.480]   When he arrived at the place where one lived,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.640]   he began speaking to himself again.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.300]   "He will be just as long as this stick."
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.460]   "No, he will not be as long as this."
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.840]   "Yes, he will be as long as this."
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.580]   These words he repeated several times
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.820]   till the boa came out and asked him,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.660]   "What was the matter?"
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.000]   "Oh, we've been having a dispute
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.260]   in Onyankapon's town about you."
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.900]   "Onyankapon's people say that you are not
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.980]   as long as this stick."
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.620]   "I say you are."
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.640]   "Please, let me measure you by it."
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.660]   The boa innocently laid himself out straight
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.660]   and Spider lost no time in tying him onto the stick
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.940]   from end to end.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.080]   He then sent him to Onyankapon.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.980]   The third day, he took a needle and thread
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.260]   and sewed up his eye.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.260]   He then set out for a den where he knew a tiger lived.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.720]   As he approached the place,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.740]   he began to shout and sing so loudly
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.720]   that the tiger came out to see what was the matter.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.780]   "Can you not see?"
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.020]   said Spider.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.940]   "My eye is sewn up and now I can see."
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.940]   "Oh, such wonderful things that I must sing about them."
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.060]   "Sew up my eyes," said the tiger.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.420]   "Then I too can see these surprising sights."
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.780]   Spider immediately did so.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.580]   Having thus made the tiger helpless,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.780]   he led him straight to Onyankapon's house.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.540]   Onyankapon was amazed at Spider's cleverness
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.180]   in fulfilling the three conditions.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.580]   He immediately gave him permission for the future
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.580]   to call all the old tales Anansi tales.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.660]   Also, from "Ancient World Echoes,"
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.020]   how wisdom became the property of the human race,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.540]   an African folk tale.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.980]   There once lived in Fontyland a man named Father Anansi.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.440]   He possessed all the wisdom in the world.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.900]   People came to him daily for advice and help.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.960]   One day, the men of the country were unfortunate enough
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.740]   to offend Father Anansi,
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.100]   who immediately resolved to punish them.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.180]   After much thought,
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.260]   he decided that the severest penalty he could inflict
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.260]   would be to hide all his wisdom from them.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.340]   He set to work at once to gather again
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.980]   all that he had already given.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.940]   When he had succeeded, as he thought, in collecting it,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.940]   he placed all in one great pot.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.180]   This he carefully sealed
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.860]   and determined to put it in a spot
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.860]   where no human being could possibly reach it.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:04.840]   Now, Father Anansi had a son whose name was Kwai Kwetsien.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:11.580]   This boy began to suspect his father of some secret design,
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.020]   so he made up his mind to watch carefully.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.900]   Next day, he saw his father quietly slip out of the house
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.460]   with his precious pot hung around his neck.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.900]   Kwai Kwetsien followed.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.140]   Father Anansi went through the forest
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.460]   till he had left the village far behind.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.740]   Then, selecting the highest
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.740]   and most inaccessible-looking tree, he began to climb.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.980]   The heavy pot hanging in front of him
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.020]   made his ascent almost impossible.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.580]   Again and again, he tried to reach the top of the tree
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.380]   where he intended to hang the pot.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.900]   There, he thought, wisdom would indeed
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.760]   be beyond the reach of everyone but himself.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.860]   He was unable, however, to carry out his desire.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.980]   At each trial, the pot swung in his way.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.540]   For some time, Kwai Kwetsien watched
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.460]   his father's vain attempts.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.660]   At last, unable to contain himself any longer,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.940]   he cried out, "Father, why do you not hang the pot
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.540]   "on your back?
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.140]   "Then you could easily climb the tree."
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.720]   Father Anansi turned and said,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   "I thought I had all the world's wisdom in this pot.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.400]   "But I find you possess more than I do.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.760]   "All my wisdom was insufficient to show me what to do.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.860]   "Yet, you have been able to tell me."
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.960]   In his anger, he threw the pot down.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.360]   It struck on a great rock and broke.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.280]   The wisdom contained in it escaped
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.700]   and spread throughout the world.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.580]   And now, from "Ancient World Echoes,"
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.580]   an Aesop's fable, "The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf."
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.580]   A shepherd boy tended his master's sheep
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.020]   near a dark forest, not far from the village.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   Soon, he found life in the pasture very dull.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.460]   All he could do to amuse himself was talk to his dog
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.100]   or play on his shepherd's pipe.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.420]   One day, as he sat watching the sheep in the quiet forest
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.700]   and thinking what he would do should he see a wolf,
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.100]   he thought of a plan to amuse himself.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.180]   His master had told him to call for help
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.300]   should a wolf attack the flock
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.260]   and the villagers would drive it away.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.900]   So now, though he had not seen anything
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.380]   that even looked like a wolf,
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.100]   he ran toward the village shouting
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.680]   at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.460]   As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.780]   dropped their work and ran
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.960]   in great excitement to the pasture.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.700]   But when they got there, they found the boy doubled up
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.940]   with laughter at the trick he had played on them.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.460]   A few days later, the shepherd boy again shouted,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.060]   "Wolf! Wolf!"
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.700]   Again, the villagers ran to help him
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.900]   only to be laughed at again.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:55.100]   Then, one evening, as the sun was setting behind the forest
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.820]   and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture,
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.580]   a wolf really did spring from the underbrush
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.160]   and fall upon the sheep.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.180]   In terror, the boy ran toward the village shouting,
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.940]   "Wolf! Wolf!"
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.620]   But though the villagers heard the cry,
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.220]   they did not run to help him as they had before.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.300]   "Pfft, he cannot fool us again," they said.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.420]   The wolf killed a great many of the boy's sheep
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.120]   and then slipped away into the forest.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.340]   Liars are not believed
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.100]   even when they speak the truth.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:48.540]   All right, some good lessons to learn,
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.820]   some great conversations that could be had.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   And I've got a few suggestions for you.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.820]   If you want to get some good conversations started at home
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.780]   as you snuggle up reading aloud,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.460]   you might ask about some of the words in the story
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.380]   that your children might or might not know.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.900]   What does conceited mean?
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.740]   Ask your children, go back and read where it is
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.140]   in the story.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.820]   Ask your children, can you figure out
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.620]   what it means from the story?
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.220]   And then from the description of Spider's actions?
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.500]   Is it good to be conceited?
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.980]   Ooh, why not?
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.340]   And then think, in our first story,
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.140]   what were Spider's three quests?
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.220]   Did they look like hard tasks?
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.340]   Would you want to have to do those things,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.900]   fill a jar with bees and catch a boa constrictor
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.740]   and a tiger?
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.740]   How in the world did Spider accomplish his tasks?
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.780]   What do you think he needed most?
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.020]   Did he need to be strong?
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.900]   Did he need to be brave?
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.540]   Or did he need to be clever?
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:21.500]   Or was it a combination of all of these?
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.940]   Now, what do you know about bees?
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.660]   Maybe you have bees in your backyard.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.460]   Maybe you know someone who raises honeybees.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:38.460]   Maybe you have even seen a wild beehive.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.860]   What do you know about bees?
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.180]   What do you know about boa constrictors?
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.900]   Most of us do not live in a place
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.540]   where boa constrictors live in the wild.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.380]   And I'm glad about that.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.980]   But maybe you have seen a boa constrictor
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.980]   at a science center or a herpetarium or a zoo.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.140]   What about a tiger?
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.540]   I myself love to see tigers,
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.660]   but I wouldn't want to meet one in the forest.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.580]   Have you ever seen a tiger?
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.780]   What did your tiger act like?
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.700]   What did he look like?
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.260]   What is your favorite part of tigers?
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.580]   How would you conquer a bee?
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.460]   How would you conquer a boa constrictor?
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.980]   How would you conquer a tiger?
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:43.060]   You might have some fun moving around.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.060]   How would you move like a bee or sound like a bee?
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.740]   What about a boa constrictor?
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.740]   How does a boa constrictor move and does he make a sound?
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.980]   What about a tiger?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.340]   Can you slink through the grass like a tiger?
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.100]   Can you pounce like a tiger?
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.980]   What sounds do tigers make?
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:14.540]   You might want to consider as a family, what is wisdom?
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.940]   What is wisdom?
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.540]   And why do people want it?
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:29.900]   Also, how do you think we get to be wise?
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:37.020]   Now, in our next story,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.380]   one of the main characters, Father Anansi,
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.940]   had to carry something very heavy.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.300]   It was a pot full of wisdom.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.220]   Now, you could spend some time talking about
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.300]   whether or not you think wisdom would fit in a pot,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.380]   but you could also talk about a time
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.060]   when you have been asked to carry something heavy.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.700]   What was it?
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.700]   What was the best way you found to carry your heavy burden?
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:16.140]   In the story, what allowed the son to follow his father?
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.500]   To find the best way to carry the pot.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.340]   How did he figure it out when his father could not?
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.940]   And maybe you would like to talk with your family
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.180]   about what is a fable?
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.380]   We read one today.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.100]   We read an Aesop's fable.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.460]   What is a fable?
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.460]   What other fables have you heard before?
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.340]   What lesson does this fable teach us?
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.300]   And here are some fun activities
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.340]   that you might do together as a family
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.300]   to make your reading come alive.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.020]   Look at the cover.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.380]   If you have a copy of "Ancient World Echoes,"
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.500]   go dig up your copy and look at the cover.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.780]   What animals and people do you see
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.620]   on the cover of "Ancient World Echoes?"
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.940]   If you have read some of the other stories,
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.700]   you might have ideas about the characters
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.300]   that you would put on the front cover.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.780]   And if you've not read many of the stories,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.460]   look in the table of contents
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.460]   and see what characters or stories catch your eye
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.300]   and think about how you would draw those.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.820]   What are some of your favorite stories from this great book?
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.680]   Now, look for stuff.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.300]   You guys all have stuff around your house.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.540]   What is stuff?
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:59.380]   They are things that you can use to make other things.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.480]   Look for stuff around your house
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   that you can use to make a spider or a snake or a tiger.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.260]   Listen, look for paper plates,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.260]   lengths of rope or yarn or plastic tubing.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.260]   Look for some pipe cleaners, some string,
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.260]   some old wrapping paper, some drinking straws.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.400]   Look for stuff that you could use
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.100]   to make a spider or a snake or a tiger.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.540]   You know what else you could do?
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:40.020]   You could take some paper and cut it all to the same size,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.100]   staple it together on one side
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.780]   and make a flip book of one of the stories
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   that we shared today.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.660]   One of the stories from one of the African folk tales
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.340]   that we shared.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.340]   Draw pictures that show the action of the story.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.540]   You could even draw a cartoon
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.660]   of one of the stories that we shared.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.660]   You could use paper and pen and draw your cartoon inside,
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.940]   or you could go outside and divide the sidewalk
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:22.500]   or your back patio into cartoon panels
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.500]   and draw the cartoon frames in chalk outside.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   Lots of the folk tales that we read together,
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.180]   especially in "Ancient World Echoes,"
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.180]   are stories that try to explain how things came to be.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.900]   How things came to be.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.900]   Explaining the world, like how wisdom is found everywhere,
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.300]   or how the African stories in many storybooks
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.260]   are called Anansi stories.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.500]   Folk tales often try to explain the world
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.620]   that we see and live in.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.540]   What could you make a story to explain?
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.620]   Think about the life you live at home with your family,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.940]   what you see happening in your community or in your state,
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.300]   or even in your country.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.860]   How could you make a story
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.860]   that explains how things are to someone else?
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.500]   Here's what I want you to remember.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   Reading is fun, and reading together is even more fun,
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.380]   but doing something with what you read
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.860]   might be the most fun of all.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.620]   I hope that you will read more stories
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.860]   from the Copper Lodge Library series this year.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.100]   And I wanna tell you,
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.180]   there are more than just "Ancient World Echoes"
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.180]   and "Old World Echoes" and "New World Echoes" storybooks.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:14.220]   The Copper Lodge Library is a whole series of books
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.140]   that preserve and present timeless stories from the past
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.340]   to help families celebrate
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.340]   and cultivate stories and virtues today.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.540]   The reason that Classical Conversations
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.180]   created the Copper Lodge Library
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.620]   is that we really wanted to offer families
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.340]   collections of stories
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.700]   that have built community throughout history,
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.980]   stories that have brought people together.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.100]   So we collected fairy tales and fables
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.220]   and how-to stories and why stories
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.420]   and stories from all over the world
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.380]   as well as stories from right here at home.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.940]   And we put them into a beautiful collection
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.380]   that families can collect and enjoy together.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.180]   And these are stories that do teach good lessons
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.100]   and give us great things to talk about as a family.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.820]   The deal is we want to preserve excellent stories
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.740]   from the past for today.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.980]   So I encourage you to find out
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.940]   what Copper Lodge Library edition you might be missing.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   We have three brand new books
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.260]   that I'd love for you to go look for,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.140]   "Pride and Prejudice," "The Secret Garden,"
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.100]   and "English Epic Poetry."
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.420]   Those are the three newest titles
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.260]   and more will be coming.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.700]   So you go and look for those
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.540]   and we hope that you enjoyed the Copper Lodge Library
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.340]   as much as we enjoyed putting it together.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.900]   But even more than that,
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.740]   we hope that you enjoy reading aloud together as a family.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.580]   See you next time.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.180]   (gentle music)
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.240]   you
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.300]   you
