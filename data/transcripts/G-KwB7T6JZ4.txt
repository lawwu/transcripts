[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400]   Our first query comes from Jack. Jack asked any tips for time blocking for those of us in ADHD
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.880]   land? Well, Jack, I hear a lot from people with ADHD. And they talk about the various habits I
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   talk about which ones work well, which ones don't, which ones need to be adjusted. And the thing I
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.160]   hear most consistently about time blocking is that it's a double edged sword. So time blocking for
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.720]   those in ADHD land is actually really, really useful, in the sense that having clarity about
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.840]   I'm doing this, and I'm doing that, and then I'm doing this. I mean, committed to that habit can
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.280]   be a really good target aimer for your attention, and make it less likely that you fall into a
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.360]   rabbit hole, as compared to, let's say, a list reactive approach where after each task, you say,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.720]   let me just look at my inboxes and calendars and think about what I want to do next. If you're in
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.560]   that mode, and you're combining that with ADHD, it's very difficult to make, let's say, difficult,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   persistent progress on things that need to get done, because there's so many shining objects
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.240]   pulling at you. The double edged sword of time blocking in this context is you can't over block
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.920]   it, you can't overdo it. If you try to build one of these heroic time block schedules, that's 10
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.520]   hours long with 15 different precision blocks, is really asking a lot from anybody to stay so on
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.520]   task and so focused and deny the lack the cognitive energy draining the distractions pulling us that's
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.480]   hard for anybody, but if ADHD that becomes almost impossible. So you need to rely on blocks while at
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.120]   the same time not blocking too much, bigger blocks, break blocks, and not trying to squeeze too much
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.480]   precision work into any one day. So that's why it seems to be a double edged sword. You're kind
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.800]   of screwed if you don't do anything like that. But you're also setting yourself up for failure
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:07.760]   if you go overboard with the method. So hope you find that useful.
