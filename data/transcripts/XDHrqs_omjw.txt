[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.200]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.360]   This episode was hosted by the Bogleheads
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.560]   pre- and early-retirement life stage
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.920]   and recorded August 25, 2021.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.680]   It features Morningstar's Director of Personal Finance,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240]   Christine Benz, discussing the six retirement blind spots
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.240]   and how to fix them.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.160]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.560]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.640]   This recording is for informational purposes
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.240]   only and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.640]   She's the author of 30-Minute Money Solutions,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.960]   A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.480]   and the Morningstar's Guide to Mutual Funds,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.320]   Five-Star Strategies for Success.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.080]   Please, again, another reminder to please
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.160]   check to make sure your video and microphone are
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.800]   off during the presentation.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.760]   And now I'm going to turn the presentation over
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.600]   to our guest speaker, Christine Benz.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.800]   Carol, thank you so much.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600]   And thank you all for coming out tonight.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240]   I don't know about where you are,
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   but it's kind of a rainy night here in the Chicago area.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.720]   You can probably hear the thunder rumbling.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.160]   But I appreciate your time.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.600]   I've so enjoyed taking part in various Bogleheads events
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   over the years.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.760]   I think it started back with probably one
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.800]   of the first Bogleheads meetings, which
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   was at our offices in Morningstar.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.160]   And then I've since had the opportunity
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.600]   to come to several of the Bogleheads conferences.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.120]   And I'm on the board of the John C. Bogle Center
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.440]   for Financial Literacy.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.200]   And it's been a really fun experience.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.560]   It's been interesting.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   We had wanted to put on a conference,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.280]   but we are using videos to fill the gap
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.560]   until we can actually do a live in-person conference.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.960]   But I just love this group.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   I love the intellectual curiosity
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.840]   that clearly permeates the boards and the ongoing dialogue
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.360]   that you all have with one another.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840]   So thank you for all that you do,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.280]   and thanks for joining me here tonight.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.640]   I'm going to share my screen in just a second.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   I'll just give you a quick overview of the presentation
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.280]   and kind of the ground that we'll cover.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.840]   It's about some key risk factors that
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.120]   confront people in retirement that will confront all of us
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.160]   in some fashion in retirement.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   And I'll talk about how to think about them
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600]   and also how to troubleshoot them at a portfolio level
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.480]   and also at a plan level.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.680]   I should note that on an ongoing basis,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.920]   I'm involved in writing, working on financial planning
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   content for Morningstar.com.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.360]   And I'm also part of a small research group
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.720]   at Morningstar dedicated to financial planning
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.200]   and retirement planning and portfolio construction matters.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560]   So it's just a small group at this point,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.360]   but we've been doing some interesting research
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.960]   on the topic of retirement decumulation.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.800]   And I think it's an especially pivotal juncture
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.480]   for retirement decumulation, because I
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.720]   think we can probably all agree that the next decade
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.440]   for investors is likely to be a little less
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.400]   positive on the return front than the past decade has been.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.120]   So that creates challenges, obviously,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.320]   especially for people who are just beginning retirement.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.760]   So I'm going to share my screen here,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.840]   and we'll take a look at my presentation.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.040]   I'll start it from the beginning.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.560]   In terms of what I'll cover, I'll
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.920]   talk about six key blind spots.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920]   The first blind spot that I'll talk about
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.960]   is maybe one that's a little less familiar.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.200]   You may not have thought about it as much.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.080]   It's retirement date risk, and I'll talk about what that is.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.200]   I'll talk about sequencing risk, which
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280]   I suspect that this group is quite familiar with.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.040]   But I'll share some strategies for potentially mitigating
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   sequencing risk, especially if you're
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.920]   brand new or about to be a brand new retiree.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   I'll talk about some strategies that you
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   can employ with respect to your portfolio
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.760]   and with respect to your plan.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.360]   I'll talk about the risk posed by the low yield environment
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.640]   today and the risks, especially for the subset of retirees.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.880]   And I have a feeling it probably doesn't describe many of you
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   in attendance, but there is a subset of retirees
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.280]   who is very much wedded to the idea of trying
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.160]   to subsist on whatever income their portfolios can produce.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.120]   That, in my opinion, typically leads
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360]   to a pretty risky-looking portfolio,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   especially given how low yields are on safe investments.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.320]   So I'll talk about the risk posed by very low yields
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.880]   today and some ways to think about that,
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.720]   again, with respect to your portfolio and your plan.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.800]   Talk about inflation.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.520]   This is one that has been top of mind for all of us,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.120]   really, regardless of our life stage over the past year,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.080]   where we've seen these supply chain dislocations.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.280]   We've seen very strong demand for goods and services coming
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.360]   out of the pandemic and even during the pandemic,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.480]   where we had these spikes in demand for various products,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.000]   whether couches or home goods, all sorts of things,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   paper towels.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.240]   I'll talk about how to think about inflation risk
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.800]   with respect to your retirement plan, again, your portfolio
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.560]   and your financial plan.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.840]   I'll talk about health care and long-term care risk.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.320]   These are top of mind for me, especially long-term care risk.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.320]   I think I've shared with this group in the past.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.760]   Both of my parents required long-term care
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.600]   and thankfully had the assets to pay for it,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.920]   did not have insurance.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.560]   But it was not a great process on a lot of levels,
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.680]   not just financially, but just sort of quality of life.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.480]   Theirs, their loved ones, it was a hard process.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   And I would encourage anyone embarking on retirement just
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.440]   to think about what is my plan and to examine that plan
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.920]   from all dimensions.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   Don't just stop with the financial aspect
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920]   of long-term care considerations.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.200]   And finally, I'll talk about longevity risk.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   I always think it's funny to call living a very long life
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.880]   a risk, but when we think about ensuring
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.000]   that portfolios last throughout a very long time horizon,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.320]   it does become a little bit of a risk
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   unless you think about withdrawal rates,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.040]   unless you think about the structure of the portfolio,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.240]   and so forth.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.760]   And I'll also talk about how non-portfolio assets fit
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.800]   into troubleshooting longevity risk.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.680]   So Social Security maximization, certainly,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.120]   but also how annuities may or may not
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.280]   fit into your plan to help mitigate longevity risk.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.560]   We will have time for questions as well.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.720]   I know that we've already had a long list
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.880]   of terrific questions submitted.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.400]   And then we'll also be taking--
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.920]   I'll also be taking questions in real time
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.720]   once I get through my prepared remarks.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.960]   So just some of the reasons why I
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.680]   love talking about simplifying retirement portfolio planning.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.520]   One is simply that, in general, it's my view
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.000]   that people who work in investing,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   who work in any area of financial planning,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.280]   there's a tendency to overcomplicate.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   I think there's a little bit of a tendency
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.080]   on the part of the industry to very much sell this message
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.840]   that whatever you're doing, it's not something
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.240]   you could do on your own.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.960]   You very much need us.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.440]   You need advice.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.240]   It's too complicated for you to figure out.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.120]   So financial planning and portfolio planning
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.400]   is complicated to begin with.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.960]   But retirement decumulation is inherently
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.120]   more complicated than accumulating assets
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.240]   for retirement.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.560]   In fact, I often feel that there's not
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.760]   that much to say about accumulating assets
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.720]   for retirement or for any other goal that you might have.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's mainly about living within your means
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.040]   and investing in a sane way, given your proximity
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.760]   to your spend-down date.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   But retirement, as you all know, especially
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.880]   if you've examined the issue as retirement is drawn close,
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.720]   you know that there are many other considerations.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.600]   There are many other dimensions.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.640]   I like to focus on this area simply
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.600]   because it's so interesting.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.440]   And there are so many different things
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.800]   to talk about, so many different experts to reach out to
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.160]   and learn from.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.040]   And that's one reason why I've really
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.480]   gravitated to this area, because it's just
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.800]   provided constant fodder for me in terms of keeping me engaged
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.840]   and giving me things to work on and write about.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.400]   I think another reason why I'm so
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.080]   attracted to simplifying retirement decumulation
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.840]   is that behavioral issues, as with all other aspects
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.120]   of our retirement plans and our financial plans,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.440]   behavioral aspects can really complicate matters
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.960]   for a lot of people.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.040]   So I mentioned that trap that many retirees fall
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.400]   into where they are convinced that they just
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.280]   want to subsist on whatever income their portfolio kicks
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:06.920]   off.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.560]   In a way, that's a behavioral issue.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.080]   It's a mistake because your portfolio doesn't know where
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.280]   you're going for income.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.960]   All it knows is that it is there to generate income and/or cash
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.520]   flows.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.960]   And so it doesn't distinguish between where
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.240]   you go for those cash flows.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.360]   But a lot of people get tripped up
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.760]   on various dimensions of retirement planning.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.160]   Annuities are another area where many academic researchers
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.520]   have puzzled over.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.040]   Well, even though we know that in some cases a very plain
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.080]   vanilla annuity might actually help this plan,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.440]   why do investors recoil from them?
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.920]   So there's a lot to discuss behaviorally.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.440]   The bucket approach, which I'm going
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.240]   to talk about during the course of this presentation,
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.960]   to my mind is kind of a positive behavioral tool
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.320]   that you can think about with respect to retirement planning.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.880]   Another reason why I like to focus on this space
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.040]   is that retirees as a group tend to be really great learners.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.160]   They have a strong appetite to retain what you're telling
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.760]   them.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.320]   There's been some research done into the realm
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.040]   of financial literacy that actually shows,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.560]   especially if you're teaching financial planning or investment
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.400]   concepts to people who don't have the capacity to implement
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.600]   them anytime soon, so like if you're teaching high school
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.800]   students about asset allocation, well,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.440]   most high school students don't have any assets to invest.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.680]   So chances are, whatever you tell them about investing,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.400]   even though you may be well-meaning,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.120]   it's probably going to go in one ear and out the other.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.560]   It's not so with people who are getting
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.400]   ready to embark on retirement or who are already retired.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.440]   They have a vested interest in spending time with,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.960]   retaining, understanding what you're teaching them.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.800]   And that's one reason why I find it personally gratifying
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.200]   to focus on this space.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.960]   And finally, I referenced that my dad
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.880]   had cognitive decline later in life
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.280]   that required long-term care.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.520]   And so I know that cognitive decline is an issue.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.120]   It's a growing issue as we, as a population, age.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.480]   And so I think it's really important to talk about,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.560]   how can we simplify our plans as we get close to retirement,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.680]   as we enter into retirement, and certainly
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.400]   as we move into the later years of retirement,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.720]   especially if we're thinking about doing this, at least
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.040]   in part, on our own.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.000]   So I like to talk about retirement planning,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.080]   not in simplistic terms, but in simplified terms.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.440]   And I like to talk about the importance of really skinning
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.600]   down the components of your portfolio,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.080]   especially as you age.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.560]   And I think as Bogleheads, you already
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.800]   very much understand the virtue of simplified approaches.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.240]   I know that some of you use radically simplified
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.480]   approaches, like Taylor's three-fund portfolio
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.400]   and the three-fund portfolio that many of you use.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.480]   So you're well ahead of many investors
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.800]   with respect to understanding the virtue of simplification.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.960]   But I like to talk about it with respect to retirement planning.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.320]   So I want to talk about the first risk factor,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.600]   first blind spot, if you will.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.360]   And this is what I call retirement date risk.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.800]   And there's a lot of data here, but I'll just summarize
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.600]   what you're looking at.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.920]   This was a survey that asked people pre-retirement
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.680]   to talk about when they expected to retire,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.560]   and then asked them in retirement, well,
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.480]   at what date did you actually retire?
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.760]   And what you can see when you look at this
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.560]   is that there's a disconnect, that just a small share
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.160]   of the population expected to retire--
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.480]   so these are the bright blue bars--
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.720]   between the ages of 50 and 64.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.000]   But in reality, about 25% of people
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.320]   said they would do that prior to retirement.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.680]   In reality, about 60% of those people
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.040]   actually retired in that age band.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.720]   Many people thought they would retire later
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.360]   than they actually did.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.200]   So you can see as you move down from between 60 and 64,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.280]   and 65 to 69, a lot of people imagined that they
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.720]   would retire in that zone.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.240]   Some people thought that they would wait until age 70.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.360]   So you see the bright aqua bars, a lot of people saying,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.800]   yes, I plan to retire later, retire
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.280]   past that traditional retirement age of 65.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.880]   What we see when we look at the data
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.200]   is very few people are able to actually do
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.880]   that for a variety of reasons.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.520]   So working longer isn't always a possibility
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.680]   due to a variety of factors.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.440]   Some of it may be ageism.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.960]   We know that people may have difficulty sticking with a job,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.680]   keeping a job as long as they might have hoped.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.200]   It might be that they have a health issue that
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.320]   keeps them out of the workforce, or their spouse encounters
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   a health issue, or increasingly, you've
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.400]   got older adults who have parents who are still alive,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.840]   who are called upon, if not to care for the older parents
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.080]   directly, to at least oversee care.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.200]   And that can disrupt work.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.920]   So there are a lot of reasons why
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.080]   we see that disconnect when we look at that data.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.680]   So I often repeat what my colleague, Mark Miller,
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.480]   who is a contributor to Morningstar.com, says.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.120]   He says working longer is a worthy aspiration,
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.960]   but it's not a worthy plan, necessarily.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.000]   You need other elements to make your plan work besides just,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.600]   I'm going to continue to work until I drop.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.960]   And I have a feeling I'm speaking
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.240]   to the converted on this.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.600]   But I think it's just important to note
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.560]   that even for those of us who intend to work longer,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.160]   and maybe who don't even have a financial need to work longer,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.640]   that for whatever reason, you may not
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.840]   be able to continue to work.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.400]   So how does this create risks for a retirement plan?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   If someone is dislodged from the workforce
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.960]   earlier than they might have expected to be.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.760]   Well, a lot of the things that are
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.320]   positives for working longer are working
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.720]   in reverse in this case.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.040]   So no additional portfolio contributions,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.320]   fewer years of compounding, obviously, prior to drawdown.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.680]   Anytime you are taking a withdrawal horizon that
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.360]   is longer than the standard 25 to 30 years,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.600]   well, that creates a risk and necessitates a lower withdrawal
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.120]   rate.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.520]   In fact, as much as I see to admire about the FIRE
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.120]   community, the Financial Independence Retire Early
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.960]   Community, the more I'm worried about some segments of FIRE
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.400]   who think it's OK to withdraw 4%.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.840]   There, my point is simply that, yes, there
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.360]   has been a ton of research done in the realm of retirement
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.240]   decumulation and sustainable withdrawal rates.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.640]   Very little of it has been done over 50-year periods.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.360]   So be very careful about withdrawal rates
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.800]   once you stretch that time horizon out.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.160]   And that's true for people with even slightly longer time
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.240]   horizons than the standard 25 to 30 years that many of us
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.800]   might use for planning purposes.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.640]   And finally, if you are forced to retire earlier
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.760]   than you expected, you may also need
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.840]   to draw upon Social Security earlier than you expected.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.600]   So again, it's that benefit that you
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.760]   get for delaying Social Security reversed.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:53.280]   You would not be able to benefit from that enlarged lifetime
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.760]   benefit that you have by delaying Social Security
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.960]   if you need to take it at full retirement age or even earlier
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.520]   than that.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.320]   So how do we mitigate retirement date risk?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.920]   Well, there aren't any foolproof answers there.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.320]   But one thing I always say to people
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.800]   who are continuing to work, who plan to continue to work,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.440]   is that it's really important to nurture our human capital
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.360]   at every life stage to make sure that we're
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.960]   taking additional training, to make sure
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.240]   that we're keeping our technology skills up to date,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.480]   to make sure that we're attending conferences
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.840]   and networking in our fields.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.600]   I think there's some tendency, once you've
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.760]   reached a certain point in your career,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.800]   perhaps to kick back a little bit on some of those things
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.920]   and coast on some of those things.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.080]   I suppose a good news story of the pandemic
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.560]   is that it's given us all kind of a crash
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.920]   course in some of the technology that we need,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.640]   some of the technology know-how that we
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.320]   need to run our home offices.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.400]   Early on in the pandemic, my husband
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.280]   would joke almost every day I'd get some box from Amazon
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.600]   that my company would send with new lighting or a speaker
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.880]   stand for my microphone.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.080]   So I really had to learn quickly how to set all that stuff up,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.480]   how to set up a home podcast studio, and so forth.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.720]   So I think that the pandemic has been good for us
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.640]   from that standpoint.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.280]   But it's just really important to continue
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.720]   to nurture that human capital, to make sure
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.920]   that we're still viable, to make sure that we're still
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.360]   saleable later in life.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.640]   I think it's also important to think about a backup career
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.920]   plan if you possibly can.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.880]   I always think through if something
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.360]   happened to my current career, and I honestly
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.840]   don't reasonably ponder that, but I think about it sometimes.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   Well, what would you do?
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.040]   And I think about potentially doing something,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.680]   hanging out my own shingle as a financial planner,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.560]   or going to work at Whole Foods in the cheese department,
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.480]   or whatever.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.120]   I think it's worthwhile just thinking
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.240]   about things that fall within your own career today,
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.680]   as well as jobs that might be easy to get that you wouldn't
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.960]   necessarily have to stay in your same field.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.320]   Another takeaway from the slide that
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.520]   shows that people tend to retire earlier than they expected,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.280]   it's important to remember to save more while you're working
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.480]   if you possibly can.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.120]   Because if you are required to draw upon your portfolio
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.680]   earlier than you expected, you'd obviously
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440]   want to have more saved.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.600]   And finally, insurance planning is in the mix as well.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.320]   So thinking through, what is my backup plan for health care
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.400]   if I have employer-provided health care currently?
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.520]   Thinking through my long-term care plan.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   I think this is important regardless of life stage,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.760]   but if you're part of a married couple,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.680]   especially thinking through what is our long-term care plan
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.520]   as a couple is also part of this thought process
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.680]   when you think about potentially your retirement
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.720]   date not being quite as much within your control
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.320]   as you might expect it to be.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.200]   I want to delve a little bit into sequencing risk, which
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.520]   I have a feeling most of the attendees
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.320]   here tonight are familiar with.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.720]   But I'll just describe what we're looking at here
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.440]   on this screen.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.880]   On the left-hand side of your screen,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.200]   we've got the actual historical return sequence
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:38.360]   that someone with a 50% equity, 50% bond portfolio
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.880]   would have encountered if they retired right
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.920]   at the beginning of the 1970s.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.040]   So in the early '70s, some of you
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.080]   may have been investing during this period.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.800]   Some of you may not have been investing during this period,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.000]   but we had kind of a killer combination for people
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.560]   embarking on retirement, where we had sky-high inflation.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:05.320]   We had the '73, '74 bear market during that period.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.400]   So a lot of things worked against investors
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.560]   during that particular period.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.320]   And that's where financial planner Bill Bengen came up
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   with the 4% guideline.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.520]   He looked at what would have been the worst period
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.920]   to retire into, and he kind of circled that part on the graph
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.280]   and said, OK, this is the area that we need to troubleshoot.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.440]   But imagine someone had a 50% stock, 50% bond portfolio,
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.280]   and they were using a 5% withdrawal rate.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.560]   So they started with $500,000.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.000]   They're using a 5% withdrawal rate.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.320]   Well, we now know that was too rich a withdrawal rate, right?
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.120]   Even though past data may have suggested
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.680]   that you could have taken even more than that,
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.200]   because of the confluence of events
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.760]   during that particular period, that was a terrible period
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.600]   to be taking too high a withdrawal rate.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.960]   And you can see that that person using that system
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.240]   would have been out of money within a 20-year time horizon.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.440]   So by the early '90s, he or she would have been out of money.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.120]   That's a retirement fail, right?
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.040]   Because we typically want to think of our portfolios lasting
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.640]   25 or 30 years or even longer.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.960]   So on the right-hand side of the screen,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.560]   this depicts what would have happened
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.440]   if that return sequence were exactly flipped,
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.360]   where that person retired in '73, '74,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.600]   but encountered the great returns
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.360]   that we had of the late '80s and early '90s.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.840]   Well, here you can see, even with the same 50/50 portfolio,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.800]   same 5% withdrawal rate, same starting value,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.880]   you can see that not only did that person
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.800]   meet his or her cashflow needs,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.240]   so not only did that person meet his or her 5% withdrawal,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.200]   but also nicely grew the principal over that time horizon.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.000]   So the takeaway here is that it's luck of the draw,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.040]   that while we might have a little bit of control
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.120]   over the specific environment that we retire into,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.520]   so if things are really bad in the year
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.040]   in which you hope to retire,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.600]   you may have the opportunity to delay retirement
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.880]   to a few years, whether you want to is another matter,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.320]   but most of us don't have a lot of latitude
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.560]   or want to have a lot of latitude
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.800]   to change around our retirement dates.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.120]   So we've got to conform to whatever environment
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.320]   we happen to be retiring into,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.920]   and I think that's an especially acute issue to bear in mind
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   if you're someone who's just embarking on retirement.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.680]   In fact, I often reference my sister.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.920]   She retired a couple of years ago.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.320]   She had a small business, which she sold,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.760]   and she has always been equity-heavy.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.840]   She has had great success with equity.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.200]   She's been a good vanguard investor
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.360]   over her investing career.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.400]   She's naturally frugal, and she's done super well.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.680]   It was pretty hard to convince her
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.560]   of the virtue of shifting into some safe assets,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.160]   but I worried, and this was a couple of years ago,
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.640]   and of course the market's been great,
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.800]   but I worried that the specific environment
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.920]   that she was retiring into just wasn't that conducive
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.960]   to her having a great result
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.760]   during the first 10 years of her retirement.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   So this is something to think about
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.920]   as you're kind of thinking about your plan.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.320]   How do you address this?
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.120]   My next slide, I just want to show.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.680]   This is what would have been sustainable withdrawal rates
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.840]   for various asset classes,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.920]   various asset allocations over various time horizons,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.000]   so over various 30-year time horizons.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   So the various graphs, the various colors here
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.080]   depict the various asset allocations,
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.360]   and each point depicts what would have been
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.080]   the right sustainable withdrawal rate
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.960]   for a particular rolling 30-year time horizon.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.120]   So you can see sort of in that period
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.640]   of the late '60s, early '70s,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.760]   that's where we went really, really low.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.800]   That's where Bill Bengen's research
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.760]   on sustainable withdrawal rates,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.000]   which then spawned a lot of subsequent research
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.920]   about sustainable withdrawal rates.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.560]   That's the particular period that he was anchoring on.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.120]   But you can see that this is a moving target,
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.480]   that the right withdrawal rate has varied completely
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.120]   upon the specific time period
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.200]   that someone might have retired into.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.960]   So the past several decades, as it happens,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.520]   have generally supported much higher withdrawal rates
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   than would be the case over the 30-year period
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   that Bill Bengen circled.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.000]   But the point is that most of us
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.880]   would rather be safe than sorry, right?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.520]   Even though we know that over certain environments,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.800]   a higher withdrawal rate would be supported,
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   we know that we want to sort of plan
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.480]   for the worst-case scenario.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.520]   And so I think that research
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.840]   about sustainable withdrawal rates
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.720]   that anchors on sort of the worst-case scenario
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.520]   is still relevant and still worth thinking about,
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.880]   especially for people
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.720]   who are embarking on retirement today.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.520]   So just to review, sequencing risk refers
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.800]   to the order in which the returns occur
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.520]   during your particular time horizon.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.600]   The perfect sequence of return risk
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.840]   would be that you are having poor returns
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.480]   in your accumulation years,
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:48.080]   so you're able to amass assets at relatively low valuations,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   and then you sell them off
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.480]   throughout your retirement time horizon
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.920]   at higher valuations.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.120]   The negative sequence of returns would be just the opposite,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.960]   where you have had strong returns in your accumulation years
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.760]   followed by weak returns in the early years of retirement.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.400]   So negative return sequencing
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.760]   can lead to really one of two scenarios.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.720]   One is where the retiree has an appropriate asset allocation
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   and has thought about how a negative sequence of returns
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.360]   could present itself,
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.280]   and also has a plan for potentially reducing withdrawals,
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.520]   especially if that bad return environment
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.200]   occurs early on in retirement.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.960]   The alternative scenario would be for the retiree
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.080]   who takes too much, has a too aggressive portfolio.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.560]   The alternative would be that that retiree
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.400]   would prematurely deplete his or her portfolio.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.280]   So the question is, are we rolling
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.040]   into some sort of a bad sequence?
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.160]   This slide depicts Shiller PE,
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.720]   which is the cyclically adjusted price earnings measure
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.560]   developed by Robert Shiller at Yale,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.400]   and you can see that Shiller PE
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.080]   has been flashing a warning signal for quite a while now.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.280]   It bottomed out during the financial crisis,
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.640]   but it has been off to the races pretty much ever since,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.400]   so we now see the Shiller PE today
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.200]   substantially above both its historical mean and median.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.360]   I would also say, though,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.320]   that this has been flashing warning signals for a while,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.160]   so I wouldn't necessarily take this to the bank,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.920]   but it is one measure of valuation.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.280]   When I look at what my colleagues
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.200]   in Morningstar Investment Management
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.680]   are expecting in terms of forward-looking returns,
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.920]   so returns over the next decade,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.640]   you can see that they are not at all optimistic
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   about what the future holds for stock and bond investors.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.200]   So these are not real returns.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.480]   These are nominal returns,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.000]   and you can see that they are expecting
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.160]   barely positive returns for the major asset classes
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.360]   over the next decade.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.000]   The bright green bars that are all dipping negative,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.080]   that's the change in the return forecast
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.560]   just over the past quarter,
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.840]   so you can see that they scaled back
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.520]   their return expectations quite a bit
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.760]   over the past quarter ended June 30th.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.680]   Just a quick note on how they arrive
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.240]   at these forward-looking return expectations,
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.000]   which aren't dissimilar to the way
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.680]   that Jack Bogle used to do it.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.640]   They're looking at starting dividend yields for equities
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.000]   as well as their expectation
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.360]   of earnings growth or contraction
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.200]   as well as their expectation
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.000]   of price earnings multiple contraction or expansion.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.480]   So the price earnings multiple contraction
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.240]   is mainly what is forcing these numbers down so low
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.200]   as well as the fact that starting yields on equities
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.360]   are pretty low.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.080]   On the fixed income side, when we look at the data,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.280]   one thing we know is that starting bond yields
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.600]   are quite a good predictor of what you're likely to earn
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.560]   from fixed income assets over the next decade.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.400]   We all know that bond yields are very, very low today,
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.320]   which in turn leads to this very low forecast
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.280]   for high-quality fixed income.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.440]   So that's our team's outlook.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.720]   Looking at other firms, what they're expecting,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.360]   you can see that there's a little bit of variation.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.200]   So BlackRock is more sanguine, certainly,
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.360]   than my colleagues in Morningstar Investment Management,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.360]   expecting 6.5% nominal returns for U.S. large caps.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.800]   The fixed income expectation is right in the same ballpark
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.920]   as what our team would expect,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   in part because the data are so clear
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.960]   on what to expect from bonds.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   Research Affiliates has its own spin on return projections,
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   capital markets, assumptions, if you will.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.720]   Their numbers are, in fact, inflation-adjusted,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.680]   so they're real return figures.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.440]   You can see that they're pessimistic,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.880]   similarly pessimistic as the Morningstar team,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.720]   especially factoring in inflation.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.480]   And then Vanguard provides
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.040]   its capital markets expectations as well.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.600]   They do do it in a range,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.480]   which I think is kind of a good way to do it.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.560]   For equities, they're a touch above
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.880]   where the Morningstar team is,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.760]   but below where the BlackRock team is.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.160]   And their ballpark return expectation for fixed income
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   is right in the same neighborhood as Morningstar's.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.880]   So I think that there are some reasons
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.440]   to be at least somewhat cautious
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.840]   as you think about your return forecast
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.120]   and as you think about the bearing
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.960]   of sequence of return risk on your plan,
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   especially if you're expecting to retire anytime soon.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.240]   I think it's safe to say that the next decade
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.760]   may not be as good as the past decade
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.720]   has been for retirees.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.280]   So how do we combat sequencing risk?
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   Well, one thing that a lot of the research
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.080]   into withdrawal rates strongly suggests
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.800]   is that there's a lot of value
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.960]   to being at least somewhat flexible
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.680]   in terms of your withdrawals.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.120]   If you can ratchet down your withdrawals,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:27.120]   if a period of weak market returns presents itself,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.880]   that will go a long way toward preserving your portfolio,
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.680]   leaving more of your portfolio in place to recover
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.600]   when the market eventually does.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.840]   And there's certainly a variety of ways
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   to go about using a dynamic or variable withdrawal strategy.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.760]   One very simple strategy,
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.600]   one that I don't really think is acceptable
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.280]   from the standpoint of quality of life
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.080]   is just to take a fixed withdrawal percentage
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.160]   from a portfolio.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.640]   So 4% in perpetuity.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.080]   The downside of that, of course,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.160]   is that you're gonna get bounced around a lot.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.240]   Your quality of life will suffer.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.840]   So I wouldn't recommend that for most people.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.400]   I like some of the ratcheting type of strategies.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.560]   The strategy pioneered by Jonathan Guyton
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.520]   and William Klinger, I think, is quite an attractive one.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's complicated, but quite an attractive one
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.000]   from the standpoint of preserving a portfolio
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.960]   in the face of sequencing risk.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.400]   So certainly thinking about withdrawal rates,
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.520]   especially if you're an early retiree,
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.120]   thinking through what your plan is
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.520]   in terms of living on a lower withdrawal rate
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.840]   if a bad market environment presents itself.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.240]   So that's step one.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.880]   Step two is thinking about the structure of the portfolio.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.680]   And key there is if you are withdrawing
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.040]   from your portfolio in a bad market environment,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.360]   to me, it stands to reason
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.880]   that you'd wanna have enough set aside in safe assets
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.600]   that you could draw upon to protect you
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.120]   from having to ever draw down
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.400]   your depreciated equity portfolio when it's in a trough.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.160]   And that brings me to the bucket approach.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.560]   And the idea there is that you are building
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.560]   a runway of safer assets that in a worst case scenario,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.320]   you could spend through if you needed to
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.880]   before ever having to touch equity assets
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.600]   when they're down in the dumps.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.160]   So in my basic bucket structure,
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.280]   I've set that runway as being 10 years worth
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.160]   of portfolio withdrawals.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.360]   Those are what you're setting aside in cash,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.200]   in high quality bonds.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   And the idea there is that if Armageddon occurs early on
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.280]   in your retirement, you would spend through
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.320]   those portfolio assets before needing
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.360]   to touch your equity assets.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.920]   Question would be, well, how did you arrive at 10 years?
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.880]   And the reason is that I've looked at rolling period returns
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.680]   and one thing we know about stocks
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.960]   is that if you have at least a 10 year time horizon,
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.720]   stocks are actually extraordinarily stable
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.960]   and extraordinarily reliable.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.240]   But once you start shrinking that time horizon
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:26.040]   to say five years, stock returns are too variable.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.840]   There's too big a risk that your particular time horizon
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   will coincide with stocks having an extended downturn.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.680]   And we don't have to look that far back into market history
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.240]   to identify a period when stocks did exactly that,
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.120]   where they sort of flatlined for a whole decade.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.440]   And the most recent example was the lost decade in stocks,
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.680]   that period from 2000 through 2010,
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.320]   where stocks essentially flatlined
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.520]   and it wouldn't have been a great time
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   to withdraw from them during that 10 year period.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.000]   But I would also say having a 10 year runway
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.160]   is kind of a luxury good today
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.480]   because it really does reduce
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.440]   your portfolio's return potential.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.080]   And I think you have to understand that
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.720]   and be comfortable with it.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.120]   But the trade-off is that by having such a long runway,
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.520]   a long bear market could occur
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.120]   and stocks could stay in the dumps for a long time
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.680]   and you would still have enough assets to draw upon.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.520]   So I am sometimes surprised that people think
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.600]   that the bucket approach is somehow gimmickry.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.320]   I don't really think this, I think it's just common sense.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.040]   And I think it's one of the most intuitive ways
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.240]   to think about asset allocating a portfolio
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.160]   regardless of what your goal is.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   So when I think about my own retirement being,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.880]   I don't know, maybe 10, 15 years off,
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.200]   I don't see a lot of need to have
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.520]   much in safe assets in my portfolio.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.720]   I do have safe assets in my portfolio
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.080]   just as sort of a matter of happenstance,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.640]   but I don't feel a strong need
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.760]   to have those safe assets in my portfolio
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.920]   because I don't expect to spend from it anytime soon.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.080]   So just to illustrate with some actual holdings,
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.080]   what this might look like.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.200]   We'll assume that we have a couple,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.840]   could be an individual with a million
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.520]   and a half dollar portfolio,
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.080]   and they're using just for the sake of simplicity,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.440]   a 4% guideline.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.560]   So a 4% type of withdrawal from that portfolio.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.320]   So the idea there is that they are taking two years worth
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.200]   of portfolio withdrawals,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.120]   and they're really not taking any chances with it.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.880]   So they are parking those funds in cash investments
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.240]   if they can eke out a higher yield
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.880]   by investing in a money market mutual fund, fine,
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.720]   but they're really not taking much risk
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.360]   with that portion of the portfolio.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.720]   They're battening down the hatches
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.280]   with the next couple of years worth of living expenses.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.760]   So they're doing this right
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.560]   as retirement is about to commence.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.040]   And then they have another eight years worth
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.760]   of portfolio withdrawals
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.080]   in a high quality fixed income portfolio.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.040]   So I would include a little bit of short-term bonds,
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.680]   a little bit of tips,
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.720]   a little bit of kind of core fixed income exposure,
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.120]   but with those two segments of the portfolio,
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.440]   that initial $120,000 plus the $480,000
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.040]   in high quality fixed income assets,
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.360]   they have 10 years worth
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   of their $60,000 portfolio withdrawals set aside.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.640]   And then they have the remainder of the portfolio
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.400]   in a globally diversified equity portfolio.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.080]   Here is where I, to the extent that someone had say,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.800]   junky bonds in a portfolio,
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.040]   so a high yield bond fund
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.560]   or dedicated real estate investments,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.320]   here is where I would include those types of assets
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.520]   because I'd wanna have a nice long time horizon
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.320]   for holding them.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.280]   So that's the basic bucket structure.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.560]   One thing I like about it is that it's really customizable.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.080]   So you're using your portfolio expenditures
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.480]   to drive how much you drop into each of those buckets.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   And so imagine that we have a college professor
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.680]   in the audience who's going to be retiring
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.080]   with a full pension,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.640]   or maybe a government worker who has a full pension
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.720]   that will cover most of his or her income needs
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.880]   in retirement.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.320]   Well, you can see if they're using that
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.640]   as the starting point to back into how much to hold
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.280]   in these various buckets,
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.080]   it would lead them to have a very aggressive portfolio.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.480]   They would probably just have a little bit in bucket one
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.320]   because they're just kind of sipping from the portfolio,
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.440]   not that much in bucket two.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.880]   They'd really have most of their assets in bucket three.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.200]   That might create challenges behaviorally,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.640]   even if that person knows that all of his or her income needs
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.280]   are coming through that pension that can still,
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.720]   I think, fluster some of us, especially in retirement,
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.400]   but at least intellectually it would call
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:18.200]   for having a very aggressively positioned portfolio.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.880]   Just want to go back to this real quick
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.120]   to discuss bucket maintenance,
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.520]   because I think that's something to think about.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.880]   So the idea is that if you're spending from that bucket one
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.840]   as you're going along retirement,
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.760]   at some point it's going to get depleted.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.840]   So you need to have a plan for refilling it.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.960]   You could use portfolio rebalancing.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.400]   You could use income distributions
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.240]   to spill over there into bucket one.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.360]   So there are a variety of ways to go about that,
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   and I'm going to talk about that in a second.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.520]   But I think that that's important to point out.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.600]   There will be many market environments
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   where you will not need to spend through buckets one and two.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.280]   You'd leave them just sort of as your insurance plan.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.960]   And in 2019 and 2020, for example,
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   those are great examples of years
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.120]   where trimming appreciated equity assets
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.840]   for most people who have retired
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.760]   was probably their best source of cash flows.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.120]   They probably would want to leave
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.400]   that insurance protection intact.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   But there are different ways
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.280]   to think about maintaining these buckets,
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.360]   but it's important to not just set up
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.800]   these buckets initially, but also to have a plan
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.560]   for what is my plan for maintaining this thing
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.720]   on an ongoing basis.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.000]   And unfortunately, it's a little more complicated
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.120]   than it looks just by looking at this slide.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.680]   And I've written about this topic
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.320]   and written about the topic
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.800]   of how you would array the buckets
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.280]   if you have multiple accounts,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.960]   which most of us invariably do have tax-deferred assets
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.000]   and Roth assets and taxable assets
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.120]   that we're bringing into retirement.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.840]   So it's important to think through that,
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.960]   and I've written about that topic as well.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.040]   Here's just a really basic minimalist portfolio
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.000]   for people who want to try to accomplish diversification
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   with as few holdings as they conceivably
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.240]   might be able to do.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.280]   So the basic contours of this portfolio are the same.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.240]   So we have that cash bucket set aside.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.040]   With the second bucket,
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.920]   we're just holding total bond market.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.840]   I use the ETF in this example,
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.160]   but you could easily use the traditional index fund.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.320]   We're not monkeying around with the short-term bonds.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.120]   We're not using tips.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.960]   And then with bucket three,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.720]   if you wanted to be super minimalist,
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.640]   you could just use a global equity fund
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.320]   like the Total World Stock Market Index.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.840]   So this is a way to even more radically reduce
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.520]   the number of moving parts in the portfolio.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.600]   Couple of reasons why I would prefer this sort of approach
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.000]   is especially with that fixed income piece.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.440]   I like the short-term bond fund
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.160]   as kind of next line reserves.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.120]   So for example, if we encounter another environment
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.480]   like the great financial crisis
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.560]   and someone has spent through their whole bucket one
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.760]   and it's not a great time to trim equities,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.080]   maybe their fixed income assets
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.160]   really aren't generating much in terms of yield.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.520]   It strikes me that certainly when we look at the performance
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.880]   of short-term bond funds,
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.520]   high quality short-term bond funds like this one,
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.400]   we see that while they're not cash substitutes,
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.360]   they do do quite a good job of holding their ground
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   in periods of market duress.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.840]   So that would be something that you could tap
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.160]   in such a situation.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.720]   So I like the idea of holding a discrete
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.680]   short-term bond fund and tips.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.880]   As many of you bogleheads know,
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.520]   treasury inflation protected securities
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.920]   are not in a total bond market index fund.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.360]   And so I think it's important to think about
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.400]   having a dedicated component of tips in a portfolio.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.480]   So that's one reason why I prefer
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.840]   the slightly more nuanced portfolio
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.360]   over the radically simple portfolio,
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.160]   but it's a matter of opinion.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.120]   This is the next risk factor I wanted to touch on.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.640]   This is the war on savers.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.080]   We all know this, that we've seen yields on safe securities
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.080]   drop very steadily over the past several decades.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.920]   And we're now at a point where you're very lucky
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.840]   to earn any sort of positive return today.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   I would urge people to shop around,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.200]   but as we all know, the pickings are pretty slim
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.840]   for cash investors.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   So this has created headaches.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.880]   I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this risk factor,
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.240]   but it has created headaches for that subset of investors
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.720]   who really wanted to try to subsist
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.800]   on whatever their portfolios kicked off.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.160]   It's very, very difficult today.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.800]   And it leaves that income-centric retiree
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.680]   with a couple of really unpalatable choices.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.520]   So one would be subsist on less income.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.720]   Well, who wants to do that?
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.280]   Most retirees don't.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.600]   And the other option would be to gravitate
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.200]   to lower quality securities.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.480]   And this unfortunately is what we see a lot of retirees do
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.160]   in this sort of environment.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.440]   We've certainly seen a lot of yield chasing going on
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.320]   over the past couple of decades.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.160]   And in an effort to build a portfolio
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.880]   that generates the income that they're looking for,
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.360]   retirees often build a really risky looking portfolio,
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.760]   at least to my eyes.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.560]   So the issue is that bond yields
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.400]   have historically been a good predictor of bond returns
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.800]   over the next decade.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.920]   We've talked about how starting yields are so low
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.480]   and that portends fairly meager returns
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.440]   from fixed income investments,
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.960]   from high quality fixed income investments, surely.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.920]   My next slide just takes a little bit of a look
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.760]   at the connection between risk and yield.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.360]   So retirees who might be inclined to venture
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.200]   into some higher yielding fixed income securities today,
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.800]   yes, you can pick up a yield
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.520]   that's perhaps a little closer
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.400]   to whatever sort of withdrawal that you're looking for,
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   but the trade-off is that you get
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.280]   a lot more equity sensitivity,
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.800]   you get a lot more sensitivity
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.560]   to what's going on in the economy.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.920]   And I've included here the 2008 returns
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   from these various asset classes,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.560]   just to illustrate this point,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.320]   that even though these fixed income assets
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.280]   didn't lose as much as equities lost during 2008,
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.360]   so the S&P 500 lost, I believe, 37% in 2008,
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.760]   nonetheless, they were in sympathy with equities
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.960]   during that period, performance declined at that same time.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.760]   So I would urge investors
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.920]   to not pursue an income-centric portfolio approach.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.880]   I'm guessing I'm preaching to the choir here,
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.600]   but it's sometimes important to talk to retired groups
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.280]   about the virtue of using a total return mindset
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   when it comes to your decumulation plan,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.160]   and just not worrying
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.720]   about where you're going for cash flows.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.920]   The name of the game is just to invest in a sensible way,
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.840]   invest in a way that is going to maximize
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.400]   your return with the least amount of risk,
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.440]   and then not worry about where you're going
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.600]   for those cash flows on a year-to-year basis.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.960]   So I'm a big believer
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.640]   in using either a total return approach
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.480]   to spending down your portfolio,
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.920]   so reinvesting all of your income distributions
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.240]   back into the portfolio,
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.120]   and then just periodically using rebalancing
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.880]   to help meet your cash flow needs
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.920]   or to refill your bucket one,
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.120]   if you are using a bucket approach,
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.400]   or you could use kind of a hybrid approach to this.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.320]   So you could use those income distributions,
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.360]   see how far they'll take you,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.360]   and use rebalancing to help get you to where you need to be
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.400]   in terms of your withdrawal.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.560]   So there's no one right way to do this.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.280]   I've talked to financial planners about how they do it
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.520]   and have actually found
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.320]   that good quality financial planners do it both ways,
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.600]   but I think it's important to just think this through
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.640]   and not use that income-centric approach.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.720]   Just a quick example of how that more hybrid approach
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.560]   would work in a real-life portfolio.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.080]   So let's assume that retirees had a $1 million portfolio
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.200]   and they were planning to take $40,000 from it in 2020,
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.720]   so last year.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.200]   A 60/40 portfolio last year
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   would have yielded about $19,000 on $1 million,
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.240]   close to $20,000.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.400]   The portfolio also had great results
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.600]   largely due to great equity returns,
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   and so the retiree could have harvested some equity assets
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   to meet additional cash flow needs.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.320]   So that's how the hybrid approach would work in action
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:11.320]   in a good year for stocks and for bonds.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.160]   In 2018, that's the best recent example
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.520]   of a not-so-good year for investors.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.840]   We know that dividend yields
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.440]   weren't much to write home about during that year.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.280]   We also know that the S&P 500
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.520]   had a small loss during that year.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.240]   So if you're a retiree using a hybrid approach,
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.920]   well, your bond yields wouldn't have gotten you very far,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.480]   and that's why my bucket system
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.440]   uses a couple of years' worth of portfolio withdrawals
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.920]   in true cash investments.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.680]   It's to help protect you against an environment like that
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.680]   where you're not having to touch bonds
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.160]   when performance hasn't been great,
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.240]   and you're not having to touch
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.360]   depreciated equity assets either.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.920]   Just wanted to spend a little bit of time on inflation.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.400]   I know that this has been bubbling up
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.000]   increasingly as a concern
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.760]   as we've all been going about our business
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.600]   and have been experiencing various price shocks
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.680]   here and there.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.640]   This is just a long-term look at CPI,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   the standard CPI calculation,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.400]   the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers,
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.840]   and you can see that it has exhibited
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.840]   a fairly steady upward trend over the past 70 years.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.160]   I think it's important to talk about inflation
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.360]   with respect to retirement
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.720]   because spending in retirement,
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.880]   when we look at the data,
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.320]   we see that older adults tend to spend a little differently
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.400]   than the general population.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.200]   So the key isn't just to take CPI and take it to the bank
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.920]   and assume that whatever you're seeing
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.640]   in terms of that broad headline CPI number
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.640]   is necessarily your spending experience.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   Dig into it a little bit
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   and think about where you're spending.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.400]   When we look at retiree spending,
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.560]   what we can see by looking at this experimental CPI statistic
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.680]   and this is in the far left-hand column,
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.480]   this is something that the Bureau of Labor Statistics
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.800]   has been calculating for the past decade plus,
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.200]   this is a look at older adults,
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   how they spend their money.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   And what we see is that CPIE is a little bit different,
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.920]   that older adults tend to spend more on housing
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.520]   than the general population for a couple of reasons.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.200]   That one's a little bit counterintuitive
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.920]   because many of us will have paid off homes in retirement,
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:45.080]   but I think it's partly because of the way
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.880]   that the statistic comes together.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.480]   It factors in people who are living
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.920]   in assisted living type situations
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.520]   or in long-term care facilities.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.760]   They are having their rent,
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.880]   which captures their other living expenses,
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.320]   not just their rent.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.680]   So that's getting factored in here as well,
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.400]   as well as the fact that even though many retirees
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.080]   have paid off homes,
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.200]   they continue to spend on maintenance of those homes
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.440]   just as much or perhaps even more than they did
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.400]   when they were working, when they were younger.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.880]   So that one's a little bit counterintuitive.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.520]   As you can see apparel,
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.040]   older adults as measured by that CPIE column
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.920]   tend to spend less on clothes than younger adults
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.600]   or than the general population.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.120]   They spend less on transport because they are not commuting.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.760]   Many of them aren't commuting.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.440]   So their travel expenses are lower.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.120]   One area where they do historically spend more
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.320]   is in medical care.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.120]   That is a line item where we see substantially
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.320]   higher expenditures of the retirees' consumption basket
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.680]   than we do for the general population.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.560]   I saw Lady Geek's hand go up.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.960]   And so I just wanted to ask if there's a question
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.760]   that I might be able to answer right now,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.920]   maybe something about this particular slide.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.680]   - No, sorry, I put it back down.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.560]   - Okay, got it.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.600]   Thanks, Lady Geek.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.800]   So the important point is that it's important
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.400]   to just think about your own spending patterns
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.480]   when thinking about how big a deal inflation is for you.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.200]   And to come back to that periodically
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   throughout your retirement and let that determine
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.920]   how worried you should be about inflation
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.680]   with respect to your plan.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.280]   So add some nuance to it.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.400]   I wrote about this earlier this year
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.960]   and actually made this little Excel calculator
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.000]   where you could plug in your own data.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.960]   You can find it on Morningstar.com
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   where I talked about something
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   about how important inflation is
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.680]   in terms of your spending plan.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.520]   You could probably find it by searching the site on that.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.240]   So just a little bit more detail
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.240]   on this issue of older adults spending more on healthcare.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.880]   We also know that healthcare costs,
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.840]   even though they've tapered off a little bit recently,
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.160]   are one of those categories where historically
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.600]   over the past several decades,
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.280]   we've seen inflation run much higher
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.720]   than has been the case for the general inflation rate.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.280]   So that's something to keep in mind,
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.920]   especially if your healthcare expenses
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.240]   trend up later in retirement.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.760]   Just keep in mind that they may have also inflated
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.960]   over that time period as well.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.880]   So this is one of the factors that tends to drive
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.240]   a higher inflation rate for older adults
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.800]   than is the case for the general population.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.440]   So why does inflation risk matter?
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   Well, I guess it's maybe obvious,
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.840]   but I'll just talk through how I think about it.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.840]   One, I just covered how older adults
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.200]   are spending more heavily on some categories
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.360]   that have been historically inflating faster
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.560]   than the general inflation rate.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.440]   Another key thing is once we enter retirement
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.480]   and we're not any longer receiving a paycheck,
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.520]   well, only a portion of our income needs
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.720]   are met through something that is inflation adjusted.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.320]   So if we have Social Security,
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.680]   well, that's an inflation adjusted benefit.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.800]   If you are a government worker,
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.880]   oftentimes you'll have an inflation adjusted pension,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.400]   but if you're withdrawing from your portfolio,
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   the portion of your portfolio that you're withdrawing
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.160]   is not automatically inflation adjusted.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:42.160]   So it's valuable to think about including some hedges
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   in your portfolio to protect you against inflation,
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.800]   because if that portfolio skews overly
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.040]   toward safe investments,
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.280]   you know that inflation is going to gobble up
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.520]   the purchasing power of that portion of the portfolio.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.960]   And then another thing to think about
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.400]   with respect to inflation is simply that
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.680]   if you have a more conservative portfolio,
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:10.400]   and many of us do bring more conservative portfolios
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.240]   into retirement than we had during our working years,
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:18.240]   we know that just as a share of that portfolio's return,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.280]   inflation will take a bigger bite out of the smaller return.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.640]   So just some reasons why inflation matters.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.120]   How do we protect against it?
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.840]   Well, this is a feather in the cap
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.320]   for holding inflation-protected bond exposure.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.160]   I know a lot of bogleheads are enthusiastic about I-bonds,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.280]   and certainly they can be really attractive,
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.160]   but if you have a larger portfolio,
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.320]   you probably need an even larger bulwark against inflation
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.360]   than you're able to buy with your I-bond allocation.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.280]   So there you might want to look to a tips fund.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.520]   The reason I often recommend Vanguard's short-term tips fund
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.640]   in this context is that Vanguard did some research,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.720]   probably it's been a decade now,
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.000]   where they looked at the best hedge against inflation
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.800]   and found that short-term tips
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:12.240]   were actually somewhat better than intermediate-term tips.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.880]   At least on a short-term basis,
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.280]   intermediate-term tips tend to be quite
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.800]   interest rate-sensitive and noisy from the standpoint
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.120]   of picking up on other things going on in the market.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   And we also know that, as a side note,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.640]   tips across the duration spectrum are more volatile
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.400]   and less liquid than government bonds,
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.720]   and they're less effective actually as ballast
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.800]   for equity exposure.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.840]   But nonetheless, short-term tips tend to be less volatile
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.920]   than the intermediate-term tips.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.680]   And then if you're concerned about inflation
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.960]   with respect to your portfolio,
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.000]   I think that this is another reason
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   to hold ample equity exposure in your portfolio,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.440]   even through retirement,
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.000]   because even though stocks are by no means
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.680]   any sort of direct hedge against inflation,
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.360]   so if inflation goes up by 5%,
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.200]   stocks don't go up by 5%,
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.440]   but we know when we look at stock returns
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.520]   over long periods of time,
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.480]   they tend to be higher than inflation
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.360]   and they tend to be higher at a meaningful level.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.200]   So that's a reason to maintain ample equity exposure
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.400]   in a portfolio later in life.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.000]   At the plan level, this embellishes the case
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.400]   for delaying Social Security
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.640]   because you do get that enlarged benefit,
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.160]   but it's also inflation-adjusted over the time period
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.320]   that you delay.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.480]   And then it's also worth factoring in inflation
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.800]   into your portfolio spending plan.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.760]   So all of the good withdrawal systems,
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.680]   withdrawal rate systems that I'm familiar with
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.160]   do give retirees an inflation adjustment
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.800]   to keep up with inflation as the years go by.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.760]   It's important to bake that in
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.720]   to whatever your withdrawal system is
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.560]   and whatever withdrawal rate you're using.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.200]   Give yourself some leeway to give yourself a raise
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.160]   when higher inflation materializes.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.720]   I wanna talk about healthcare costs briefly.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.920]   This is a slide that my former colleague,
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.320]   David Blanchett prepared,
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:20.320]   where he looked at retiree spending across the time horizon.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.560]   And what David's research showed was really provocative,
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.000]   but also I think pretty intuitive,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.560]   was that retiree spending tended to be quite high
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.400]   in the early retirement years.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.040]   And a lot of times that's kind of pent-up demand
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.280]   where retirees wanna do travel
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.160]   or engage in expensive hobbies
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.880]   or pay for weddings for their kids
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.200]   or whatever that might be.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.600]   There are some pent-up demand there.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.200]   And then the spending, and this is an aggregate
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.560]   looking at groups of retiree households over time.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.680]   In aggregate, David witnessed
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.200]   that that spending tends to trail off
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.360]   before heading up again later in life.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.880]   And in the middle period, that trailing off,
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.640]   we can probably all identify with that period.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.680]   If we had parents or grandparents,
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.440]   they probably slowed down a little bit in their late 70s.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.880]   If they were once international travelers,
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.040]   they may have backed off that a little bit.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.960]   Not in every case.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.440]   I know plenty of very active travelers
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.720]   who are well into their 80s,
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.960]   but when David examined the spending patterns
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.880]   of older adults, he definitely saw
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.360]   this tapering off sort of pattern.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.840]   Retirees may have had two homes, sold one,
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.920]   now just have one and so on.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.880]   But then spending trended up.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.800]   And I think we can also all make a good guess
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.040]   about why that was.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.480]   And that's mainly that healthcare costs
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.280]   tend to trend up later in life.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.560]   And that is true even for people
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.160]   who have good insurance income.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.160]   In some cases, they may have more out-of-pocket costs.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.200]   They may hit that prescription drug limit
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.920]   where they have to pay a certain amount
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.000]   of their costs out-of-pocket.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.120]   There are a lot of reasons
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.320]   why we see healthcare costs trend up later in life.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.160]   Uninsured long-term care costs
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.640]   are another big factor in the mix.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.120]   And that's one reason why we tend to see
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.000]   what David called the retirement spending smile,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.880]   where we see the go-go years early on,
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.680]   this low-go years in the middle,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.920]   and what have been called the no-go years later on,
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.960]   where perhaps someone has encountered health conditions
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.560]   that have kept them from,
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:40.520]   that are causing them to incur higher expenses.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.760]   So many of you are familiar with the Fidelity data
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.640]   on healthcare spending and retirement.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.840]   Fidelity annually puts out these very scary estimates
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.320]   of what retirees are apt to spend
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.960]   during their retirement time horizon.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.360]   The most recent estimate
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.480]   was in the neighborhood of $300,000.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.120]   Importantly, that figure does not include long-term care.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.760]   It includes other stuff,
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.880]   Medicare premiums, supplemental insurance,
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.080]   policy premiums, co-pays, deductibles,
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.080]   pharmaceutical costs that aren't covered by insurance.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.760]   So that's a big number.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.960]   But what my friend Maria Bruno at Vanguard
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.600]   often reminds me of is that it's not a brand new expense.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.640]   Most of us have healthcare costs during our working years.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.800]   We just don't really feel them or bother to tally them up.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.040]   They are just deducted by that invisible hand
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.400]   from our paychecks
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.360]   for getting healthcare through our employers.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   So I do think that that's an important note to bear in mind.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.920]   Vanguard's subsequent research on this topic,
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.520]   which it did in collaboration with Mercer,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.200]   found a lot of nuance
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.040]   in terms of retiree healthcare spending.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.080]   So geography matters a lot.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.920]   Certainly if you live in a large urban center,
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.760]   it stands to reason that you're generally
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.280]   will have access to very good quality healthcare,
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.160]   but it'll also be higher cost healthcare
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.560]   than you might have in a more rural area.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.040]   So geography matters.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.120]   So does health, quite intuitively,
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.520]   that we have a lot of people
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.200]   who are able to sail through retirement
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.560]   with very few healthcare costs.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.840]   And then we have other folks
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.240]   who have very high healthcare costs.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.920]   So it's hard to predict,
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.360]   but it is very individual specific.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.760]   So how do we think about this?
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.080]   How do we mitigate this?
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.920]   I think it's important just to think about healthcare costs
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.960]   as a component of your spending plan in retirement.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.080]   So begin to think about some sort of a customized estimate
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.280]   based on your own situation.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.600]   And of course, past is not predictive
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.520]   when it comes to our own health conditions,
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.640]   but you probably at least have some idea
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.080]   if you have chronic health conditions.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.200]   Think about geography if you are in an urban area
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   or if you're the type of person who knows,
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.320]   well, if I do encounter some illness,
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.640]   some really bad illness,
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.520]   I'm the person who wants to go
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.400]   to the top quality cancer center or whatever it might be.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.840]   Well, know that you will probably pay more
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.880]   out of pocket for that.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.120]   And then also,
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.960]   as you think about your in retirement spending,
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.360]   factor in the likelihood
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.440]   that your healthcare expenditures
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.000]   are unlikely to move in a straight line
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.720]   throughout your retirement years
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   that you may encounter higher costs late in life.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.560]   If you're an early retiree,
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.520]   you'd wanna think about having higher healthcare costs
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.600]   early on if you're not yet Medicare eligible.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.680]   It's crucial to make smart decisions on insurance coverage,
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.760]   and that's really beyond the scope of this presentation
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.200]   and not really my specialty area anyway,
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.520]   but just giving due consideration to healthcare coverage,
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.240]   it gets more important as we age.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.880]   Then I also just wanted to make a note
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.000]   about the virtue of taking advantage
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   if you're still in accumulation mode,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.800]   if you haven't yet retired
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.000]   and you're not yet covered by Medicare,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.040]   take advantage of tax advantage ways
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.240]   to save for healthcare expenses.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.080]   So just a quick shout out
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.840]   for using a health savings account.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.040]   I have been a happy user of mine since Morningstar
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.760]   introduced the high deductible plan several years ago.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.920]   And I immediately told my colleagues,
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.000]   I was like, "I'm doing that."
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.760]   And some of them were looking
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.440]   and running the math on the PPO.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.960]   And some of them said,
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.160]   "Well, I still think I wanna stick with the PPO."
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.000]   And I was like,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.240]   "I don't think you're seeing what I'm seeing,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.400]   which is that I'm seeing a great additional receptacle
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.080]   for retirement savings."
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.240]   But HSAs can be really attractive
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.800]   regardless of when you use them from a tax standpoint
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.880]   in that it's the only triple tax advantaged savings vehicle
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.480]   on the whole tax code.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:11.520]   So you're able to put pre-tax dollars into an HSA,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.600]   the money grows tax-free,
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.920]   you can invest it in something
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.680]   and the money coming out
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.440]   that is used for qualified healthcare expenditures
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.480]   is tax-free as well.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.240]   So a key advantage is the tax benefits of these accounts.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.360]   Worst case scenario,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.640]   and you somehow over-save in an HSA,
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.520]   so you save more than you actually need
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.480]   for healthcare expenses,
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.560]   the tax treatment is essentially
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.720]   just like a traditional IRA.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   So I think it's a pretty attractive vehicle in this context.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:53.840]   So just a quick discussion about long-term care.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.640]   This is something I've written a lot about
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.480]   and have talked about the various ways
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.920]   to think about funding it.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.160]   Just a quick discussion about what long-term care is.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.360]   It's non-medical care for people
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.400]   who are unable to complete what are called
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.360]   activities of daily living.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.200]   So this would be feeding themselves,
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.960]   showering and so forth,
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.640]   people who need assistance with those jobs.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.600]   This type of care,
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.960]   there's a lot of confusion about what Medicare does
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.520]   and does not cover.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.520]   Medicare does not cover most long-term care.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.360]   It does cover what's called rehab,
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.960]   some long-term care-like care
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.080]   after a qualifying healthcare stay,
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.600]   but in terms of being any sort of bulwark
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.840]   against long-term care costs,
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.320]   Medicare, unfortunately, is not it.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.800]   Medicaid is a resource for some people.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.800]   In fact, Medicaid is currently the largest payer
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.960]   of long-term care costs in the US,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.800]   but it is not an optimal option
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.440]   in that you don't have much control
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.040]   over where you receive that care.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.560]   You typically wouldn't have the ability
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.600]   to receive that care in your home
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.880]   if that was your preference.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.920]   The costs of long-term care are incredibly sobering.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.680]   Genworth does an annual report
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.880]   where they look at the cost of care,
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.040]   and the most recent statistic
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.120]   was about $100,000 in long-term care expenses
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.240]   for someone receiving nursing home care
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.320]   in a facility with a private room.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.440]   We see a lot of variation in long-term care costs.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.120]   It's cheaper in rural areas,
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.240]   more expensive in big cities,
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.600]   but generally speaking, this is a big ticket outlay.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.000]   It's important to get familiar
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   with some of the statistics related to long-term care.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.160]   Every year, I do this summary of long-term care statistics,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.400]   usage and costs and so forth.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.200]   Women tend to need long-term care more than men,
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.920]   and the reason is pretty intuitive,
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.440]   which is that women typically live longer
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.760]   than their male counterparts.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.600]   They're often the caregivers for their male counterparts,
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.880]   but their male counterparts on average die earlier,
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.520]   and so women tend to need more paid long-term care than men.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.080]   The average length of stay,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.560]   the data are kind of all over the map on this,
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.840]   but the average length of stay
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.800]   is about two, two and a half years.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.680]   The really vexing part of long-term care
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.200]   is that about half of us will need long-term care,
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.960]   and about half of us will not need long-term care,
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.800]   so it makes it really hard to figure out what to do.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.920]   There are a couple of ways to think about
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.680]   protecting against long-term care.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.000]   You can purchase pure long-term care insurance.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.360]   The issue, and many of you
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.720]   could probably recite this back to me,
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.200]   the issue is that we've seen premium increases
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.800]   really skyrocket.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.840]   We've seen premiums skyrocket over the past couple of decades
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.240]   as insurers have seen really bad claims experience.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.120]   It turns out that if people have long-term care,
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.280]   they're likely to use it,
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.800]   and it also turns out that if you try to budge people
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.040]   from having long-term care by raising their premiums,
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.240]   they tend to hang on,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.440]   and I think I would do that as well in this situation.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.360]   I'd say, "Forget it. I've paid into this thing for as long.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.000]   As long as I have, I'm sticking with it,"
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.200]   so we have seen pure long-term care insurance premiums go up.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.640]   Arguably, it's priced more realistically today
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.680]   than it was a couple of decades ago.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.920]   I think insurers probably didn't anticipate
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.560]   the sustained decline in interest rates that we've had,
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.120]   which has been troublesome for them,
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.080]   but I think new purchasers of long-term care insurance
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.840]   probably are getting a more realistic look
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.720]   at what they'll pay,
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.600]   but it's always possible premiums could go up,
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.680]   so pure long-term care insurance is one option.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.320]   These hybrid policies have increasingly come on strong,
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.880]   and these are typically either a life insurance contract
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.120]   or some sort of an annuity contract
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.920]   with a long-term care rider bolted on top of it.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.720]   We've seen many of these policies
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.200]   come to market over the past decade.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.160]   Insurers have been selling them,
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.880]   and there's certainly an element of optionality,
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.840]   I think, that's really attractive about them,
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.960]   this idea of, "Well, if I don't need long-term care,
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.120]   at least I'll have something to show for myself
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.640]   for having paid for this thing,"
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.440]   so I think that's attractive,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.880]   but the products are incredibly complicated,
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   so I would only go into such a purchase
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.720]   with the guidance of an objective third party
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.400]   to help coach me through the trade-offs of these products.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.840]   One attraction to these products, well, two, actually,
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.760]   one is that the underwriting standards are much less
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.880]   than is the case for pure long-term care,
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.480]   and then the other key one
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.280]   is that you purchase them with a lump sum,
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.480]   so you won't be subject to these premium increases
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.480]   that the purchasers of pure long-term care have faced.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.640]   So self-funding, I have a feeling that's probably the avenue
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.080]   that a lot of this group will pursue.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.480]   What frustrates me about that discussion
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.760]   is that I sometimes hear these one-size-fits-all
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.840]   sort of rules of thumb
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.200]   about how much you need to have in assets
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.440]   to be able to afford to self-fund,
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.560]   and to me, that's completely frustrating
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.960]   because assets doesn't tell you anything
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.000]   unless you know what someone's spending from that portfolio.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.280]   You could have $6 million for all I care,
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.120]   and if you're spending too much from it,
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.400]   I might still tell you
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.840]   that you should probably buy insurance.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.480]   So there's no one who is safe
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.000]   simply because they have a certain amount of assets.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.200]   It comes back to are you spending a safe amount
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.920]   from that portfolio?
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.600]   Does it look very likely,
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.120]   based on that reasonable spending rate,
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:12.800]   that your portfolio will last and you'll have some leftover?
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.080]   So I would say if you go through that thought process
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.680]   and go through that exercise and determine,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.160]   "Yes, I can comfortably self-fund long-term care,"
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.160]   I would say then it's incumbent upon you
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.680]   to take that next step of,
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.360]   "Well, what's my plan for those assets?
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.760]   How do I invest those assets?
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.600]   How do I set them aside and segregate them
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.400]   from my spendable assets?"
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.760]   And finally, just touching on Medicaid-provided care,
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.200]   there are certainly limitations
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.560]   about how you receive that care,
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.600]   and then it can also create financial hardship
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.440]   if you're part of a married couple for the well spouse.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.160]   So it's an avenue of last resort, I would say,
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.320]   although much long-term care in the US
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.680]   is funded by Medicaid.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.160]   Just a quick note on longevity,
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.440]   and I want to be sure to leave time for your questions.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.680]   This is just, I think, a good news story in a lot of ways
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.280]   in that we're working fewer years
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.800]   and we're being retired for a greater number of years,
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.040]   and so that gives us more time in retirement.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.160]   I don't have an extension to this slide,
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.400]   but I would expect that we have seen this pattern
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.680]   become even more intensified
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.120]   where we've seen people retiring for even longer periods
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.080]   and their work years have shrunk,
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.240]   but we all know that that creates a challenge
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.840]   from a portfolio planning perspective.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.840]   If we are anticipating a retirement of 25 or 30 years
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.040]   or more, if we think we have longevity on our side,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.560]   that means that we need to plan for a really long retirement.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.800]   One slide I would call out on this
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.520]   is there's a one in three chance
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.000]   if you're part of a married couple
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.640]   that one of you will live to age 95,
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.920]   and I don't have it here,
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.040]   but if you look at the data
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.440]   for more affluent segments of our population,
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.960]   the numbers are off the charts
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.440]   in terms of the likelihood
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.040]   that one partner in the couple will live
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.800]   to or beyond age 95.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.160]   One thing we know, obviously,
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.400]   is that higher incomes are correlated
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.720]   with longer life expectancies in the US.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.680]   In fact, I was in a group with Laura Karstensen,
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.800]   who's head of Center for Longevity Research at Stanford,
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.360]   and we were asking, we were lobbying questions at her,
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.880]   and I asked her to explore the correlation
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.320]   between income and longevity,
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.120]   and she said, "It's everything."
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.560]   And then she went on to provide more nuance,
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.640]   but it's really important
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.960]   if you are someone who's had access to good healthcare,
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.160]   if you've had access to more healthcare,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.040]   chances are you will have greater longevity.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.000]   Meanwhile, a countervailing force,
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.080]   even as we're living longer,
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.600]   is that many fewer of us are coming into retirement
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.960]   with that full pension
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.440]   that perhaps our parents and grandparents had.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.400]   And so that creates a challenge
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.240]   in that we do not have a full income source
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.360]   that will last throughout our lifetimes.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.560]   We have Social Security,
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.080]   but for more affluent people,
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.880]   that will only get us part of the way there.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.720]   So how do we think about longevity?
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.760]   Well, this gets us back
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.720]   to thinking hard about withdrawal rates.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.360]   I mentioned I'm sometimes nervous
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   about the fire proponents taking 4%.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.240]   If you have a longer time horizon,
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.640]   I think it's incumbent upon you
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.000]   to think about being able to make due
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.240]   on less in retirement,
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.440]   taking a more conservative withdrawal rate,
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.360]   required minimum distributions.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.960]   As many of you know,
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.960]   follow a certain succession where they step up
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.320]   and they may take you higher than your comfort level
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.480]   in terms of your portfolio withdrawal.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.440]   If that's the case,
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.400]   if you think that you will live a very long time
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.840]   and you want to ensure that your portfolio lasts,
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.640]   you'd want to reinvest back in the portfolio.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.760]   And here's another argument for holding stocks,
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.720]   that holding stocks with the growth potential
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.000]   that they have historically brought,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.960]   that gives you a little bit of a defense against inflation.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.360]   It gives your portfolio a little bit more growth
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.280]   than would be the case if you hunkered down
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.920]   in very safe investments today.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.720]   If you're concerned about longevity,
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.280]   as I think anyone embarking on retirement
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.000]   should be thinking about,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.680]   it also embellishes the case
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.280]   for maximizing non-portfolio sources of income.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.600]   I touched briefly on thinking
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.640]   about social security maximization
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.280]   and using Mike Piper's great tools
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.960]   for thinking about how to approach
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.400]   the social security filing decision.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.160]   If you are eligible for a pension,
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.400]   really thinking through,
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.960]   are you better off doing the annuity or the lump sum?
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.760]   If you are thinking about longevity,
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.360]   worried about longevity and want to protect your plan,
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.160]   the annuity will often be the more attractive option.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.560]   And then finally, if you don't have a pension,
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.160]   just thinking about what role,
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.600]   if any, annuities might play within your plan.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.120]   Because while there are lots of criticisms about annuities,
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.400]   the very simple income-oriented annuities
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.600]   do help provide longevity protection
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.520]   by delivering a lifetime benefit.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.480]   So there are basic immediate income annuities,
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.800]   the single premium immediate annuities.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.920]   There are deferred annuities,
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.600]   which tend to be less popular,
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.400]   but are pretty interesting
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.480]   in that they allow you to plan for that knowable time horizon
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.680]   and then have that product that kicks in
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.960]   and provides you a benefit
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.680]   if you happen to live well beyond that knowable time horizon.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:54.040]   And finally, qualified longevity annuity contracts
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.840]   are relative of the deferred income annuity.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.960]   This is something that you would buy
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.400]   within the context of your IRA,
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.240]   but essentially would work in basically the same way
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.960]   and would also help reduce the amount of your portfolio
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.440]   that's subject to RMD.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.080]   So the amount that you've steered
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.960]   into the qualified longevity annuity contract
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.600]   would be deemed to satisfy the CULAC
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.360]   for that portion of your portfolio.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.000]   So just some food for thought,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.720]   we could do a whole session on annuities.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.960]   I think it's a super interesting topic.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.600]   I saw there was a question in the queue
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.360]   about my own retirement plan.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.160]   And I'll tell you one thing that I intend to do
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.840]   if I can talk my husband into it,
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.840]   is buy an annuity to get us our basic income expenses
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.800]   combined with social security.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.640]   So I think that's all I've got here.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.080]   I know that the group
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.440]   is going to make my slides available to you,
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.200]   so no need to email me
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.000]   if you want a copy of my presentation,
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.920]   but certainly send me feedback
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.640]   if you have it on the presentation.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.240]   I love Boglehead so much,
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.720]   and I love that you've all been here tonight,
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.000]   and I'm happy to tackle your questions right now.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.080]   So I'll just pause it right there.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.800]   I'm gonna stop this too, I think,
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.600]   because we don't need to look at this slide anymore.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.840]   - Thank you so much, Christine,
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.360]   for that wonderful comprehensive presentation
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.720]   that was so much material in that.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.400]   And yes, we will make the slides available
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.600]   along with the recording within a week.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.840]   Yeah, we do have some questions that were pre-submitted.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.720]   I'm gonna read it through a few of those.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.480]   Then we'll see if there were some from the chat.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.840]   I know a lot of the ones in the chat
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.880]   were on the bucket strategy,
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.160]   which I think you did answer some of those.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.320]   And we do wanna allow at least 20 minutes or so
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.080]   for the raised hands, live questions.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.800]   So thank you so much, Christine.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.200]   Okay, here's a couple of questions.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.800]   Okay, if you have an inflation-adjusted pension
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.560]   in Social Security that covers your basic expenses,
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.880]   how do you determine the most appropriate
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.600]   stock bond cash allocation
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.760]   when you do have like an inflation-adjusted pension?
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.200]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.520]   There, I would get back to
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.440]   what are you using the portfolio for?
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.640]   And I would ask to allocate it based on that.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.720]   So if I were spending from it only sporadically
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.600]   because my income needs were being met
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.640]   through these other sources,
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.760]   I think that would tend to argue
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.800]   for having modest allocations.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.080]   If you're using the bucket approach,
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.760]   modest allocations to the cash
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.600]   and the high-quality bond bucket
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.520]   and relatively more in the equity portfolio.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.920]   But I think a couple of factors would figure in.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.360]   One would just be my own risk tolerance.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.920]   So what I just talked about is risk capacity.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.560]   That's how much risk you could take
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.640]   and arguably should take.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.760]   Risk tolerance is like,
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.240]   how do you feel about having huge losses in your portfolio
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.880]   and not having been retired?
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.880]   I don't know for sure,
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.080]   but I've talked to enough retirees
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.080]   to know that it feels different
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.000]   to be withdrawing from a portfolio when it is declining
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.200]   or even not withdrawing from a portfolio
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.800]   when it's declining,
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.560]   that you might tend to feel a little more risk averse.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.960]   So I think you would at least want to have a nod to that,
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.160]   to how you might feel about that.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.680]   And the other fact is that as someone who's in that,
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.480]   what sounds to me like a very good situation,
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.040]   you have more money for luxury goods.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.080]   And I don't mean expensive watches and cars,
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.040]   although maybe,
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.240]   but I mean that peace of mind is a luxury good.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.480]   And so arguably, if it helps you sleep better,
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.000]   helps you not focus on your portfolio,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.200]   helps you do more things that constitute
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.560]   your quality of life,
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.200]   you should have more safe assets.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.640]   I think this often gets short shrift
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.600]   in the discussion of optimizing this and that.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.280]   It's like, because peace of mind cannot be optimized
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.920]   and we can't talk about it in sort of a math framework,
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.280]   I think a lot of the industry
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.120]   kind of leaves it by the wayside,
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.280]   but I consider it so important.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.800]   And I think it's really crucial to think through
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.560]   what gives you peace of mind.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.680]   Same goes with long-term care insurance.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.480]   I mean, you may be a person who looks
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.400]   at your financial plan on paper and says,
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.640]   I do not have a need for long-term care insurance.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.240]   I'm absolutely in the self-funding camp.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.240]   Well, if nervous worries about not having money leftover
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.000]   for your kids or whatever it might be
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.680]   really eats away at your quality of life,
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.600]   well, then maybe you should have long-term care insurance.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.720]   Maybe the answer you see on paper
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.040]   isn't necessarily the answer you should pursue.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.400]   So it's a good question.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.040]   I thank you for it.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.360]   - Thank you.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.440]   The second question is,
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.800]   will income taxes become the biggest problem
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.400]   for retirees in retirement,
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.120]   assuming they are in good health?
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.720]   - Well, that's a broad question.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.920]   I certainly think a lot about tax planning in retirement.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:15.600]   And I think that there's a lot of art
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   that retirees can employ in terms of keeping their taxes
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.480]   down on a year-to-year basis.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.240]   There's art and some science.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.360]   So I would say it makes a lot of sense
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.880]   to be somewhat tactical on a year-to-year basis,
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.800]   looking at your tax situation, looking at your deductions,
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:40.600]   using that to determine the silos that you draw upon.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.960]   So there might be a year where you have heavy deductions
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.840]   and your plan might have been
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.360]   to not touch your tax-deferred assets
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.400]   and use your taxable assets or something like that.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.480]   Well, in such an instance,
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.080]   it might actually make sense
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.960]   to accelerate the tax-deferred withdrawals,
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.600]   take the tax hit in the year that you know
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.280]   that you have the big deductions.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.320]   So whether it's the biggest problem
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.400]   that will confront retirees,
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.040]   I would say it may be for some,
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.680]   but I would say that it's sort of a high-class problem.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.320]   I guess when I think about the struggles
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.120]   that retirees go through,
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.800]   I wouldn't put that toward the top of the heap.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.240]   And I would also caution,
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.200]   I had an interesting discussion with Carolyn McClanahan,
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.480]   who's an MD and a financial planner,
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.000]   about longevity, about cognitive decline, and health.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   And I told her about my dad's situation,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.920]   and I was like, "Yeah, I've got cognitive decline
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.240]   "in my family and I'm really healthy."
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.120]   And she was like, "Oh, that's a bad combination."
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.120]   Because if we're likely to,
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.240]   the longer we live,
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.280]   the more likely we are to encounter cognitive decline
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.840]   is the bottom line.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.960]   So anyway, I have a hard time saying
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.840]   that taxes will be the worst thing that befalls anyone,
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.160]   but I think it's a problem that can be managed.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.960]   And it's a problem where some people may want
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.920]   to get some advice,
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.280]   whether from a financial advisor who can coach you
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.520]   on where to withdraw from year to year,
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.120]   or there are some software tools
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.720]   that help you strategize about this.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:32.200]   But there are ways to help reduce your tax bill.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.240]   I know Roth conversions are a hot topic among this group.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.440]   You can also take advantage of that sort of pre-retirement,
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.520]   or sorry, post-retirement pre-RMD period
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.720]   as a period to keep your income way down
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.960]   and potentially think about pursuing Roth conversions,
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.000]   think about even accelerating withdrawals
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.800]   from tax-deferred accounts.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.400]   So you have some tools in your toolkit.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.240]   I don't think it's a lost cause.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.280]   - Right, thank you.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.760]   Could you comment on investing now
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.040]   with the market at its all-time highs?
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.800]   What advice would you give to someone
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.080]   that has like a lump sum, say 100 or 200K to invest?
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.440]   Would you recommend dollar cost averaging
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.280]   over a year or another timeframe?
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.200]   If so, what Vanguard fund would you recommend
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.040]   to keep the cash in while waiting to buy in?
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.160]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.880]   It's something I've certainly thought a lot about.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.960]   And I would say a couple of years ago,
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   I would have said to dollar cost average,
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.040]   and I'm gonna say dollar cost average today,
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.960]   but dollar cost averaging a couple of years ago
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.520]   would have been the wrong answer, right?
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.000]   We know that the best answer would have been
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.600]   to just put your money in stocks,
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.800]   but we don't know what the future holds.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.040]   And stocks have had quite a good run
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.040]   and are arguably a little bit fairly priced,
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.920]   if not overpriced.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.920]   So I would dollar cost average over a period of a year or so.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.120]   And I guess it would depend on what percentage
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.440]   of my portfolio that windfall happened to be.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.400]   But I would think about not tarrying too long.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.800]   I would get a plan for getting the money into the market.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.440]   And then in terms of risk,
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.800]   it seems in terms of what to invest in,
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.400]   it seems like you could keep the money
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.040]   in something fairly safe, like a short-term bond fund.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.440]   You could kind of split the difference
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.040]   and use sort of a balanced fund,
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.640]   which would have the virtue of,
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.160]   even if stocks drop,
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.960]   that would be buying stocks for you on the down days.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.480]   So there are a couple of ways to think about it.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.600]   I probably would keep the money pretty safe
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:48.000]   and dribble it into my desired asset allocation
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.160]   over a period of a year or so.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.600]   - Okay, great.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.840]   Okay, we do want to save some time for the live questions.
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:57.040]   So I'm sorry, we may not be able
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.360]   to answer everybody's questions tonight.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.480]   Miriam, were there any questions from the chat
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.680]   that were not, I know a lot of those
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.720]   were from the bucket strategy,
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.120]   which were answered during the presentation.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.920]   Were there any questions during the chat
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.200]   that we want to ask Christine right now
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.520]   that weren't answered already?
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.600]   And you're muted.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.000]   (mouse clicking)
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.160]   - Yes, I'm looking for the question.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.280]   It was from Wood Spinner.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.920]   And the question had to do with,
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.880]   here it is.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.400]   I'm not sure that it was completely gone over.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.280]   Could you discuss your thoughts
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.400]   on amortization-based withdrawals,
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   the VPW, TPAW, et cetera, approaches for retirement?
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.840]   - Hmm, Miriam, I'm afraid I don't know
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.960]   what that is in reference to,
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.520]   and I wouldn't be able to answer it cogently.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.240]   So I'll have to apologize.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240]   - That's okay.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.080]   - They probably need a different expert for that question.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:55.920]   - Okay.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:01.280]   One other question had to do with long-term care insurance.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:04.720]   And you mentioned that it can be complicated.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.720]   How would we go about purchasing long-term care insurance?
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.440]   And at what ages should we look for it?
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.560]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.360]   I just talked to AARP yesterday about this very issue.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.200]   I would use a third party, an objective third party,
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.280]   to help me navigate this process.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.200]   So actually, my husband and I went through this process
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.040]   last summer.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.720]   We have not come to any conclusions yet,
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.480]   but we use an hourly financial planner
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.800]   to help us with a few oddball things that come up
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.560]   related to equity compensation that we receive,
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.760]   and some of the tax ramifications of that,
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.520]   as well as we wanted help with this long-term care product,
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.360]   long-term care decision.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.720]   And our planner enlisted the help of a person
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.840]   who specializes in long-term care,
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:59.320]   but is not wedded to any particular insurer.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.600]   And she gave us a really good walkthrough.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:06.480]   We were interested in some sort of a hybrid product,
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.680]   we thought, and it was incredibly thorough,
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:15.040]   and there were no strings attached, no obligation,
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.680]   but it was money well worth spending, in our view,
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:22.200]   and that it helped us get familiar with the landscape.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:25.040]   I suppose you could do it on your own,
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.080]   but I really liked the idea of having someone
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.200]   who was knowledgeable about the landscape.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.680]   And she was making comments like,
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:36.360]   well, this insurer, I've had clients who have had trouble
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.040]   with claims with them.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.960]   Those sorts of things were really valuable to us
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.040]   as we navigated.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:46.080]   So I would get some sort of an objective guide,
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.720]   because it is an important decision.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.160]   And then in terms of age,
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:55.160]   you typically hear sort of the 55 through age 60 period
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:32:00.160]   as kind of the sweet spot where people begin
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.520]   thinking about long-term care.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   Certainly if you purchase it at a younger age,
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.760]   you can obtain lower premiums,
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:08.720]   but then you're paying those lower premiums
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.560]   over a longer time period.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:14.360]   And then the other issue is that you, I think,
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   run a greater risk of the insurer remaining viable.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.240]   So I think that that is potentially a reason
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.720]   against investigating and investing
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.360]   in long-term care too early.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.240]   So kind of that late 50s period,
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.640]   it's important to also remember
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:36.520]   that healthcare considerations are in the mix as well,
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.040]   that the older you get,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.920]   not only will the coverage become more expensive,
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.800]   but it will also be harder to qualify.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.680]   You may have some disqualifying healthcare condition
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.040]   or your spouse might.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.160]   So that's also important to keep in mind.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.280]   - Along those lines,
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.680]   did you find that there was long-term care insurance
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:00.440]   for dementia?
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.680]   Because that is often the issue that dementia lasts,
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.960]   as you mentioned, can last for many years
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.760]   and that you might run out of long-term care insurance.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.360]   Are there policies that you found
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:17.000]   that would cover the term of dementia?
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.400]   - Well, it's a really good question, Miriam.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.280]   Some policies are indeed, do indeed have,
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:28.760]   most policies do indeed have a specific time period
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.360]   that they cover, but most of them, I believe,
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.400]   would cover an extended period
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.320]   in exchange for a higher premium, of course,
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.760]   but you would be able to find a policy
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.880]   that would cover long-term care over a longer timeframe.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.840]   I think what the marketplace needs,
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.720]   and unfortunately it's not available,
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.120]   is a policy that would kick in
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.400]   after like three years of care,
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.560]   because I think that's what probably a lot of this group,
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.200]   that's what I would be attracted to,
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.640]   would be like, well, I can easily pay three years of care,
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.720]   whatever it is.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.680]   I'm worried about being that person
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.840]   who needs 10 years of care.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.120]   And that, unfortunately, due to state insurance regulations
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.920]   is something that has not come to market.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.360]   But dementia, cognitive decline in all its forms,
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.920]   is the main driver of long-term care.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.520]   It's the main thing that is not covered
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.840]   by the traditional insurance, by Medicare,
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.600]   by your supplemental policy.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.800]   It's, unfortunately, the onus is on all of us
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.880]   to figure out a solution,
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.400]   and it's quite suboptimal, as it turns out.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.000]   (upbeat music)
