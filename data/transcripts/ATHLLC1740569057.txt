[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.960]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.680]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.040]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.440]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   And today we're talking to Paula Pan, the founder and creator of Afford Anything,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   where she runs an award-winning personal finance website, a monthly newsletter
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.360]   with almost 100,000 subscribers, a top 50 podcast.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   She has an amazing story, starting her career as a journalist, making
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.520]   only $21,000 and building up her business and a portfolio of
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.920]   rental properties from scratch.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.480]   We'll talk about breaking free from a traditional nine to five job.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.280]   We'll talk about learning to value your time, taking mini retirements
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.440]   throughout your life, setting up streams of passive income, and how
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.800]   life is just one big set of trade-offs that allow you to afford anything you
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.920]   want, and at the end, I'll make sure to get some of Paula's favorite hacks.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   Well, after I remind you that Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront, all opinions
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.600]   expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and do not
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.120]   reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.840]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.280]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.600]   Paula, thank you for being here.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.640]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.560]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.040]   So I have to start with Afford Anything.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.320]   So to some, I think it could sound like a get-rich-quick infomercial.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.600]   I know it's so much more than that.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.560]   Can you let people know what you mean when you say you can afford anything?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.520]   Sure.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.480]   The whole philosophy behind Afford Anything is that you can afford
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   anything, but not everything.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.800]   So every choice that you make is a trade-off against something else.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.840]   And that doesn't just apply to your money.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.440]   That applies to any limited resource that you need to manage, like your
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.080]   time, your focus, your energy, your attention.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.680]   Fundamentally, the concept of Afford Anything is the concept of opportunity costs.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.600]   It's so easy to fall into the trap of thinking that life is an endless series
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.680]   of ands, when in fact life is a series of ors.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.160]   And are there specific things you think most people get wrong when they
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   think about all of these trade-offs?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.960]   Oh God, people do so much wrong.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.880]   Where do I even begin?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.800]   In terms of spending the money that you currently have, we'll start there.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.840]   People often will, when they want to cut back on their spending, they
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.120]   chase the discretionary items, which provide a psychological victory of
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.320]   easy wins, but don't actually move the needle.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.680]   So if you, for example, buy a cheap beer instead of a $14 martini, you can
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.080]   pat yourself on the back for the fact that you spent only three bucks on the
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.640]   beer instead of $14 on the martini, right?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.040]   But what you're doing in that one, in that one instance, in that isolated
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.760]   incident, is you're giving yourself a veneer or a facade of having made a frugal
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.720]   decision without actually doing something substantive that would move
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.000]   the needle in the long run, right?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.560]   If you were to put that same level of cognitive effort into, let's say putting
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.680]   more effort into a search for your next apartment so that you are renting
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.160]   something that is $350 a month cheaper with a similar square footage, or if you
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.040]   were to put that same level of effort into being more aggressive about finding
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.720]   discounts on the types of insurances that you have, for example, right?
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.160]   The non-sexy stuff, if you were to put that same level of effort into
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.920]   weatherproofing your home, you know, weather stripping and caulk, like that
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.520]   sort of thing actually moves the needle, but it doesn't provide the psychological
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.640]   victory, and so much of the time we're chasing the buzz, we're chasing the
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.920]   dopamine hit, rather than the efficacy.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.080]   Yeah, I've heard you call this fake frugality at times, and it's something
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.800]   that I've definitely struggled with.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.080]   Is there a way that you would recommend people, myself included, get over it?
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.920]   Because sometimes it's not as easy as just saying, "Well, yeah, of course it
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.400]   makes more rational sense to spend time on these big decisions, but I feel like
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.000]   saving money and optimizing at every point is so ingrained in my being that
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   it's hard to not compare the prices of the beers at a restaurant and think, "Oh,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.360]   maybe I should get the $7 one instead of the $9 one and save a couple dollars,"
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.640]   even though it doesn't move the needle.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.320]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.280]   It's difficult to do.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.720]   I mean, fundamentally, you're asking a question about self-awareness, right?
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.160]   And it's difficult, and actually, really what you're asking is how to translate
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.720]   self-awareness into action, like how to bridge the awareness-action gap, which
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.880]   is the question that has plagued mankind since the dawn of history.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.480]   So I don't expect us to have it solved by lunch.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:21.320]   But where I would start would be in terms of saving money to focus on the big three,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   housing, transportation, and food.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.480]   Those are the areas where you're likely to have the biggest wins.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.520]   And in fact, if we want to extend that to the big four, it would be housing,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   transportation, food, taxes, right?
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.760]   If you can just nail those four things, you can get a lot of stuff wrong as long
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.400]   as you get those four things right.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.600]   Beyond that, there's also, I think for most of the people who are listening to
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   this podcast, a very strong argument that perhaps saving money is not the side of
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.120]   the spectrum that they should be focused on.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.920]   One of the philosophies that I like to teach is a philosophy called "Grow the
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.240]   Gap," and what "Grow the Gap" means is that what we ultimately care about is the
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.160]   gap between what you earn and what you spend.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.320]   And there are only two ways to grow that gap.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.400]   You can either earn more, you can spend less, or you can do a combination of the
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.760]   two.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.440]   And I would venture to say that the majority of people who are listening to
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:25.160]   this podcast are probably educated enough, skilled enough, experienced enough that
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.680]   their bigger win could be found on the earning side of that equation.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.680]   Yeah, I think I've heard a lot of people say there's a lot more upside to earning
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.840]   than downside to cutting costs, because most people can't spend an unlimited
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.760]   amount of money, though I've seen people try.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.240]   You can't shrink your way to greatness.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.880]   I know.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   And I think sometimes if you're really not spending mindfully, there might be a
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.360]   lot of opportunity to cut there.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.960]   But once you've done that, there's not that much more to go, and there's a lot
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.720]   more creativity that you can apply towards earning more.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   And I know you talk a lot about financial freedom.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.400]   How do you think that applies to this equation of earning more, having to work
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.280]   to make money and cut costs?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.160]   So as I see it, financial freedom gives you the ability to no longer have to do
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.400]   something purely for the paycheck and gives you the ability to choose the type
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.440]   of work that you do so that you can do the work that is most aligned with your
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.800]   skills, your talents, and what the world needs.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.800]   For all of us, there was a time in our lives where we had to do stuff for a
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.280]   paycheck.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.000]   I mean, I was 15 when I got my first job at the drive-thru of McDonald's, right?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.680]   Like the vast majority of us, unless you come from a very wealthy family, there's
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.200]   a time in your life, even if it's high school, college, maybe your early 20s,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.160]   where there's just stuff that you have to do.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.920]   You got to do what you got to do, right?
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   Like you do what you need to in order to pay the bills.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.160]   You do what you need to in order to survive.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:59.200]   Financial independence, as I see it, is building enough of a safety net such that
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.640]   your basic survival is taken care of.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.080]   That doesn't necessarily mean that you are "retired," as you call it, the
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.440]   cessation of work, right?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.520]   Which is a beautiful way of describing it.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.880]   It is not the cessation of income-producing activity.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.520]   It is simply building enough of a safety net that if everything goes to hell, you
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.200]   know that you can survive, you know that you can be okay.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.000]   When you have that confidence, when you have that safety net built underneath
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.640]   you, then you no longer have to worry about keeping the lights on and you're
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.240]   free to take bigger risks.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:39.400]   I know you talk a lot about breaking free from this kind of nine-to-five life where
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.760]   you're working for 40 years straight, getting a couple weeks of vacation.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.840]   Do you think that you can obtain this kind of freedom that lets you live life
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.320]   on your own terms while you're still working a job for someone else?
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.160]   Or do you have to work for yourself to do this?
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.600]   Oh, no, you don't have to work for yourself.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.760]   You mean in order to reach financial independence?
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.800]   Yeah, and have that freedom.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.680]   You don't have to work for yourself in order to do it.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.400]   I think oftentimes, even when I talk about escaping the nine-to-five, the
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.440]   nine-to-five is a metaphor, right?
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.680]   The nine-to-five, or when I talk about escaping the cubicle, those are metaphors
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.920]   for sucky jobs that you're in, not because you want to be in them, but because you
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   feel like you have to in order to pay the bills.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:33.800]   I have no objection to working your dream job at a company or a nonprofit or some
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:40.960]   sort of enterprise that genuinely thrills you and makes optimum use of your talent
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.480]   and time and skills, you know, something where you know that you are building a
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   legacy and you will know that you are leaving an asset behind, like that type
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:58.560]   of work, the ownership is less important than whether or not you are achieving
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.040]   autonomy, mastery, and purpose through the work that you do.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.920]   And what research shows is that if you have that sense of autonomy, mastery,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.160]   and purpose in your work, then you are highly likely to enjoy that form of work.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.520]   And so when I talk about escaping the nine-to-five, I'm using nine-to-five as a
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.600]   metaphor for those jobs that don't give you proper autonomy, perhaps they
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.640]   micromanage you, they don't give you mastery, perhaps they're a poor fit for
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.040]   your skillset, and they don't give you a sense of purpose, you know, you're not in
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.480]   alignment with the type of legacy that you want to be leaving behind.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.720]   Yeah, I think I'm fortunate that after many years of discovery and searching, I
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.680]   found something where I actually really enjoy working for someone else and
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.080]   fulfilling autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.240]   And I, but I know it seems to be, and this is unfortunate, but the norm when I talk
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.160]   to people is that they haven't found a job that they all love in that way.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.680]   And that working for yourself is something so many people seem to aspire to.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.040]   So what advice would you give to someone who's at a job that kind of falls into
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.240]   that metaphor of a nine-to-five, something they're not loving and fulfilled by?
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.880]   If the goal is to grow a sufficient safety net, such that they then have more
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.800]   options, more flexibility, the first thing that I would ask that person is, what is
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.160]   the most effective way for you to grow that gap, grow the gap between what you
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   earn and what you spend?
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   Now, for some people, particularly if you're already a high income earner, and
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.200]   you live in a large home, you drive a newer car, if there's obvious low-hanging
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.560]   fruit that you can cut from your lifestyle, then cut the low-hanging fruit
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.840]   first, because it does give you that initial win, and that initial win does
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.720]   provide that psychological motivation to continue on the path.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.680]   So particularly for high income earners, I would start with downsizing to a less
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.800]   expensive home, downsizing to vehicles or transportation that is functional
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.120]   rather than luxurious.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.320]   I would start there.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   Once that's done, I would not endlessly iterate that, because that I think is
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.760]   where a lot of people go wrong, where they get so caught up in over-optimizing
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.320]   that they, you know, when you hit the point where you're like unscrewing the
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.400]   oven light to save like, you know, two cents worth of electricity, you've gone
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:27.920]   too far.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.800]   Before that, you've gone too far.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.400]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.120]   And I use that example because that's literally an example that I read on a
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.000]   website once.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.680]   The same person who also recommended tearing dryer sheets in half in order to
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.880]   make a box go twice as far, you know, like when you're bisecting your dryer
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.000]   sheet, you know, you've crossed the line.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.040]   So don't become obsessive about extreme frugality.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.200]   Pick the low-hanging fruit and then shift your focus and find a way that you can
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.720]   earn more.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.400]   Now, depending on the career that you're currently in, this could come in three
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.320]   different forms.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:09.440]   Either you look for a promotion in your current line of work, whether that means
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.320]   getting promoted in your own company or creating a bidding war amongst many
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.440]   employers so that, you know, making a lateral move or even a vertical move into
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.080]   another company, right?
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.960]   So it could be a promotion within your own line of work.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.040]   That's option number one.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:30.240]   It could be retraining into a career change and retraining into a different
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.880]   line of work, ideally without going to grad school or without going back to grad
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.280]   school.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.080]   And the reason that I say ideally without grad school, it's not because of grad
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.520]   school itself.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.320]   It's because of student debt avoidance, right?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:47.560]   So retraining with a new skill set in a way that does not incur student debt.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.520]   That would be option number two or starting some type of entrepreneurial
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.320]   enterprise, some sort of side hustle.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.560]   That would be option number three.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.040]   So depending on your current line of work, one of those three options would be
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.160]   ideal for you.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.720]   And which one is right for you depends on what you're doing.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.920]   If you're an anesthesiologist, obviously picking up a few extra shifts at the
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.040]   hospital is going to be a much better use of your time than selling candles on Etsy.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.800]   Right?
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.240]   So this one size fits all that a lot of personal finance gurus out there espouse
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.560]   where they're like, everybody should start a side hustle is far too much of a
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.520]   blanket statement.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:32.480]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.040]   emerge.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.560]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.120]   processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.200]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.360]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.800]   37,000.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.600]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.720]   I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.800]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.560]   financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.800]   25.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.920]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.200]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.480]   not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.080]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.680]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.520]   source of truth.

[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.800]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.600]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:01.080]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.280]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.280]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.160]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.400]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.680]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.920]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.800]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.960]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.800]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   friendly.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.520]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.240]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.400]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.000]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.040]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.440]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.760]   happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.200]   world.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.160]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.560]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.360]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.440]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.000]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   So we had a Nick Loper on the show from Side Hustle Nation, and we talked a lot
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.120]   about some of the side hustles you can do to earn some extra income, but I don't
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.280]   think we spent as much time on how to transition side hustles into working for
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.520]   yourself and how to actually start a business.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.360]   And I know that's something you've done.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.560]   That's something you've talked about.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.920]   You've interviewed lots of people.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.280]   When someone kind of has that idea in their mind of, "I think I want to work for
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.360]   myself at some point," do you have a plan that you would share with them or a path
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.320]   or a process that someone should go through to try to make that happen?
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.880]   So first of all, when we talk about the world of side hustles, I want to
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.360]   distinguish between two forms of side hustles.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.560]   First, you've got what I refer to as gig economy side hustles, things like driving
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.000]   for Uber, driving for DoorDash, walking dogs.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.880]   This is the low-hanging fruit of side hustles because you can start earning
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.680]   money immediately, but you're fundamentally not really growing your own
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.800]   business, right?
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.280]   You are fundamentally a dog walker on Rover or a driver for Uber.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.160]   Great if you need a quick hit of cash, but it's not something that's, I think,
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.600]   scalable for the long term.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.560]   So I want to distinguish between that gig economy form of side hustle versus
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.440]   starting your own business.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.480]   And when you start your own business, you can either sell a service or sell a
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.080]   product.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.720]   A lot of people start as service providers because there's a low cost of capital in
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.360]   doing so.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:06.920]   And, you know, so for example, perhaps you have a skill that you can sell as a
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.320]   freelancer, right?
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.760]   Whether that skill is writing, web design, coding, logo design, whatever that skill
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.280]   may be, perhaps there's a skill that you can sell as a freelancer or as a
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:18.960]   consultant.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.320]   That is a low cost of capital way to start.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:30.200]   And a lot of people begin there and that will allow you to become self-employed.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.960]   But there's a distinction between being self-employed versus being an
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.680]   entrepreneur.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:43.520]   And if you do your job well and you are successful at selling the service that
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.640]   you are offering, there will eventually come a point where you have to make the
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.440]   decision, do I want to become an agency, meaning do I want to be an agency that
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.960]   sells this service, or do I want to transition into product development and
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.520]   sales?
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.800]   And by the time that happens, you will be far enough into self-employment.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.520]   You will be far enough into selling the service that you offer that I think
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.320]   you'll have a clear idea of which of the two paths you want to go in.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.120]   I'll give you an example from my own life.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.240]   So I used to be a newspaper reporter.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.440]   I made $21,000 a year and those are 2005 dollars, right?
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.800]   That's not like in 1942, I made 21,000.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.400]   So I graduated from college 2005.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.920]   I first job out of school.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.160]   I made $21,000 a year as an entry level newspaper reporter.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.360]   I worked at that newspaper for three years.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.000]   And at the time that I quit, my ending salary was $31,000 per year.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.080]   So that is what my honors diploma got me.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.600]   And 2008, I was like the last person to get the memo that print newspapers are
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.840]   not the way of the future.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:56.120]   I was going to conferences and everyone at newspaper conferences back in 2008,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.280]   like people were showing photos of Craig Newmark, I think the guy who invented
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.920]   Craigslist.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.920]   People would show his photos on slide decks and they'd be like, this guy killed
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.840]   newspapers.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.560]   You know, this guy destroyed classified ad revenue.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.880]   And so it was clear that the whole industry was collapsing.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.440]   A lot of major newspapers were shutting down.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.520]   McClatchy was on a hiring freeze.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.480]   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer had gone to online only, I believe.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.080]   Rocky Mountain News shut down.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.920]   So it was clear to me that the future was going to be freelance and online.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:31.760]   And so my thinking in 2008 was I've got to transition into being an independent
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.200]   journalist.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.960]   I need to be freelance.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.880]   I need to be online.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.760]   I wasn't thinking about starting a business.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.400]   I wasn't yet aware that there was a distinction between self-employment and
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.160]   entrepreneurship.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.400]   And so my thought process at the time was simply, can I create a job for
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.040]   myself?
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.120]   And so I began my career as a freelance personal finance writer, freelance
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.520]   personal finance journalist.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.640]   I specialized in that niche, knowing that like specializing in a niche would be the
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.080]   key to getting freelance gigs.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.280]   And I did that for a number of years.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.560]   And I eventually just hit the point where the work that I was getting wasn't just
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.040]   coming from news organizations.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.760]   A lot of it was coming from fintech companies because fintech companies needed
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.600]   content on their websites and they didn't necessarily have enough staffing to have
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.160]   an in-house content creator.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.040]   And so they would have some harried overworked marketing person who would
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.680]   contract with me to write articles.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   So I began doing that and then I realized that this harried overworked marketing
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.440]   person didn't really have the bandwidth to even manage me.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.200]   And so then I just scaled up and was like, tell you what, I will provide turnkey
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.240]   content management services.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.120]   And I became an agency and I started hiring writers under me and became content
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.040]   management for hire for certified financial planners, for accountants, for
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.240]   small fintech companies.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.720]   This was maybe 2012, 2013.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.200]   And that was the transition from self-employment to entrepreneurship.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.120]   And it happened very organically.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.360]   There was never a plan.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.880]   It was never a goal.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.440]   I just sort of kept seeing where the needs were and what the pain points were in the
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.120]   market and then continually responded to those.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.320]   And then in parallel, I was also building out AffordAnything and I was growing this
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.680]   audience at AffordAnything and this audience kept asking me questions about
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.160]   investing, specifically real estate investing, because I was doing that with
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.200]   the money that I was making.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.600]   And so there were enough questions coming from the AffordAnything audience that it
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.920]   was clear that there was demand for an online course.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.760]   And I hit the point where I was like, I can't do both.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.160]   I can't be a service agency and also develop a product.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.040]   I'm going to have to do one of the two.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.200]   And neither of these are built out enough that I could sell either company.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.040]   So one of them, I'm just going to have to pull the plug on.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.960]   And that was terrifying.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.680]   To grow a six-figure business and then just pull the plug on it was like
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.480]   absolutely terrifying.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.240]   But I pulled the plug on the service agency, cut all of that and went entirely
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.800]   into product development and built this course for AffordAnything.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.880]   And I assume the course, when you first made that decision, wasn't already
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.680]   generating six figures that it could easily replace the service business.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   Is that correct?
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.200]   Correct.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:20.880]   Yeah, it was not.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.360]   So I feel like that decision might be very similar to the decision of many people
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.240]   who are working at a six-figure job.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.320]   And thinking about a business they could run, thinking about starting something
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.880]   on their own and are terrified with the idea of basically losing their income
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.720]   and starting something and taking a risk.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.600]   And so is there anything you learned from going through that, that you would tell
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.880]   someone facing that same kind of terrifying decision of giving up the known
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.240]   for the higher upside, more enjoyment unknown?
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.560]   So I was absolutely terrified and I probably delayed making that transition
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.600]   by a year longer than I should have.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.240]   What gave me a lot of peace was knowing that if I could do it
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.480]   once, I could do it again.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.640]   So I wanted to take this, this moonshot.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.760]   I wanted to see if I could grow AffordAnything to become as big as it
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.920]   could be and I knew that if it flopped, if it didn't work out, I had already
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.080]   grown a six-figure service business once.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.440]   There's nothing stopping me from being able to do it again.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.680]   I was talking to a friend who worked at Google and they were considering whether
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.160]   they left to start a business on the side and I gave them kind of a similar
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.600]   piece of advice, which was, do you think that if this didn't work and you went
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.040]   back, you could get hired again?
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   And their answer was like, of course, like everyone is trying to hire talented
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.320]   people, my performance reviews have been great, I'm sure that in a year, if I left
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.800]   this job and things didn't work out and I reached out to my manager and said, Hey,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.640]   could I come back?
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.200]   They would absolutely say yes.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.720]   And what it did was it changed the perspective of, it's not giving up my
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.920]   career to go try something.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   It's taking a year off and knowing that the downside isn't a career, it's however
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.280]   many months of income I would lose by taking this risk.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.040]   And so they'd saved enough money that, you know, they could do that.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.640]   And they said, okay, I'm going to take a year off.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.880]   And if it doesn't work, I might know after three months, I might know after six
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.160]   months, so it's a relatively low risk.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.920]   And some companies, if you're transparent, might even just let you take a
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.560]   sabbatical.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.200]   You might not even have to leave to go explore this.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.520]   If you work in a field where, you know, your services are so in demand that
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.360]   companies would kind of do all kinds of things to try to make sure that they
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.080]   accommodate you.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.040]   So you can do this, even if you've never started a business before, you've got
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.800]   hired before.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.440]   So it could be that your, that is your opportunity cost as well.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.760]   Absolutely.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.720]   Absolutely.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.480]   And what I love about the opportunity cost, as you just described, when you
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.280]   have a runway, then fundamentally the only thing that you're risking is that
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.520]   you are living more frugally than you otherwise would be.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.920]   And when that's the worst case scenario, that's not that bad.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.360]   No, especially if you're doing something you're passionate about.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:15.200]   It is so hard if you're working a job you hate to maybe give up a few of the
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.720]   joys you have in life, but if you're giving up the job you hate to go do
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.800]   something you're incredibly passionate about, and every day you're excited to
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.640]   be doing what you're doing, it's way easier to maybe give up the vacation
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.080]   that year or a nicer car because you have this thing you're so passionate
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.120]   about to focus on.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.240]   And so I think it's easier to be frugal in your life when you're doing it
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.560]   because you get to do something that fulfills you more.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.720]   Exactly.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.800]   Exactly.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.000]   So one of the things you mentioned was that you had started investing in real
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.520]   estate, and earlier we talked about how you could get a promotion, you could
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.200]   find a new career, you could start a business or generate your own income.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.280]   We didn't talk much about the idea of passive income, but I know you sometimes
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.800]   talk about the long game, about ways that you can start to apply your time,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.360]   skills, and money towards generating kind of really sustaining long-term
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.880]   financial returns.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.320]   What do you think about passive income versus active income, and should
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   everyone be focused on it to some extent?
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.400]   So the first thing that I would say about passive income is I want to
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.480]   emphasize that passive income is not a euphemism for free money.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:38.880]   Passive income, or its synonym residual income, is front-loading the workload.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.040]   And it refers to the type of income that you make from any project in which you
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:52.400]   do a ton of work up front so that you can enjoy that residual stream later.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.160]   That could be writing a piece of software or a book or a piece of
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.680]   music that provides royalties.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:04.520]   That could be building out a YouTube channel or a website or a podcast where
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.920]   you're still monetizing the back catalog, making money off of episodes
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.760]   that you created or articles that you created years ago, right?
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.280]   It could be buying rental properties where you front-load that workload of
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.120]   searching for the property, renovating it, getting it ready for those first
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.960]   tenants, finding a great property manager, building out the systems and
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   putting that in place.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.840]   That is another example of passive or residual income.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.800]   But I do think it's important to emphasize that it is in no way a
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.920]   euphemism for free money and building out streams of passive income requires
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.400]   a significant amount of work.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:49.200]   That said, what I love about passive income is that it separates time from
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.600]   money.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.120]   So much of the time we frame money in the context of time.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:59.680]   So we might say I charge X per hour or he or she makes Y per year.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.360]   And so this link between time and money is very held together in our minds.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.160]   And what I think is beautiful about passive income is that it destroys that
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:15.880]   link and allows money to flow in independent of our input of time.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:22.480]   Yeah, and I think if you're able to set those streams of income up, then it
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.120]   makes it easier to have the flexibility to maybe pursue a new business down the
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.480]   road.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.600]   Obviously, if the business is the passive income, then that's a little
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.000]   different.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.680]   But one of the forms of passive income I know you're passionate about, or at
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.280]   least you've spent a lot of time on is rental properties.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.600]   And I think one of the interesting characteristics of it is that unlike
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.360]   maybe writing a piece of software or creating a piece of music, it's a bit
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:51.280]   more accessible in that if you don't know an instrument or you aren't able to
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.600]   write software, those other ones are pretty difficult.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.640]   Not that you can't learn and train up, but I think they feel less approachable.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.440]   But buying rental properties is something that I think many people see as much
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.360]   more approachable.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.360]   Do you think that it could be something as a first step in passive income for
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.320]   almost anyone?
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.560]   Or do you recommend it for certain types of people?
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.920]   I would say that the first thing is that you have to actually want to do it.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:21.600]   Right now, rental properties have enough buzz that there are people who are
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.480]   FOMOing into it, doing it because everyone else on the internet is.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.800]   And if that's your motivation, then that's the wrong reason to do it.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.960]   And in any endeavor that you pursue, whether it's your career, your
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.320]   investments, your relationships, like there will be tough times.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.280]   And if you don't actually want it in the first place, you're not going to be able
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.800]   to hang on through the tough times.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.240]   So don't invest in rental properties unless your desire to do so is genuine.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.480]   That's the first thing I'd say to anyone.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.640]   That being said, I do believe that if the desire is genuine, any middle class
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.120]   person in the United States would be able to do it.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.120]   You don't need to be handy.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.280]   You don't need to live in a low cost of living area.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.040]   I'm a firm believer in investing out of state for people who live in high cost
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:08.520]   areas.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.600]   In fact, I prefer out of state investing over local investing for a variety of
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.040]   reasons.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.560]   The big one being that it forces you to treat it like a business, forces you to
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.600]   develop systems, it forces you to build a team.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.720]   You can't just swing by and replace the batteries and the smoke alarm.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.680]   And so the forcing function of living far away from your properties, I think,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.480]   it absolves you from the need to be handy, forces you to treat it like a
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.200]   business, and gives a lot of geographic arbitrage power to people who are high
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.680]   income earners living in high cost cities.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.240]   I know you have a course that talks a lot about getting into this, and we'll
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.440]   definitely link to that course in the show notes for people who are interested.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.040]   But at a high level, is there anything you would recommend someone do to start
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.880]   to say, "Am I passionate about this?
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.000]   Can I make this work?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.240]   Do I have enough money saved?"
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   Are there a few criteria you'd check off that would make someone a good fit for
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.360]   buying a rental property?
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.600]   Well, if you have credit card debt, pay off the credit card debt first.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.360]   Don't do anything until you've done that first.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.280]   Now, that doesn't apply to student loans.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.120]   It doesn't apply to, of course, if you have a primary residence mortgage.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.200]   If you've got that lower interest, single digit interest rate debt, I'm less
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.040]   concerned about that.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.120]   But certainly pay off your credit cards, make sure that you have an adequate
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.320]   emergency fund, take care of those financial basics first.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:31.600]   And if you are offered a 401k match or a 403b match at work, make sure that you're
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.360]   contributing enough to your retirement accounts that you're at least getting
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.000]   that match.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.960]   So those are the first steps.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.880]   That's what I refer to as financial basics.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:44.480]   After those financial basics are taken care of, then the world is your oyster in
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.560]   terms of what types of investments you want to go into.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:53.400]   And if your interest is going into rental properties, then it is time to dive in and
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.120]   learn about it.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.760]   I think the mistake that a lot of people make is they go in unknowingly.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.840]   They make assumptions like they assume that as long as the rent covers the
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.000]   mortgage, they'll be okay.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.640]   That's one of the worst beginner assumptions that you can make.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:14.720]   And so a lot of people, because they, I call this the error of the apparent
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.960]   similar, where because they have experience doing something at the amateur
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.520]   level, they believe that they can do it at the professional level.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.480]   You know, just because you can hit a ball around a tennis court does not mean that
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.120]   you have the skill set of a Wimbledon player.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.640]   Just because you can make dinner for yourself at home, it does not mean that you
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.840]   have the skill set of Gordon Ramsay, right?
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.920]   And so just because you've been able to purchase a personal residence for
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.000]   yourself does not mean, you know, how to look for properties, how to analyze
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.640]   properties, how to think about renovating properties.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.720]   It doesn't mean that you know how to think like an investor.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.200]   And the mistake that a lot of people make is that because they've done this at a
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.600]   personal level, they believe that they know how to do it at a professional level.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.520]   And that's the reason why I think it's, it's so important to learn how to
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:12.880]   properly analyze, find finance and make renovation decisions.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.640]   I don't mean pick up the hammer yourself.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.360]   I mean, create a scope of work, how to do that from the lens of an investor.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.000]   And when you got started, you didn't know any of this.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.480]   How did you learn all of it?
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.800]   It was a combination of trial and error, reading as many books as I could get my
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.920]   hands on and going to investor meetup after investor meetup after investor
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.560]   meetup, you know, like repeated exposure to the point where I could eventually
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.120]   separate the wheat from the chaff, like the signal from the noise.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:45.360]   The unfortunate reality in the world of real estate is that there are a lot of
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.720]   what I call like the scambergurus, you know, lamborgurus driving scambroginis.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.760]   You know, you have a lot of ego in real estate.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.840]   You have a lot of people who are flashy and they are promoting high risk, high
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.960]   leverage strategies, and frankly, I think a lot of what they're saying is
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:12.040]   dangerous and they say it because they have a vested interest in selling their
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.920]   idea to you.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.320]   When you think about the world of real estate, most of the people that you deal
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.960]   with, real estate agents, lenders, these people don't get paid until you make a
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.600]   purchase.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.480]   And so their incentive structure is to get you to buy.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.600]   And oftentimes they will not give you the full picture.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.520]   They are not fiduciaries in your corner.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.880]   And so I think what's unfortunate about the world of real estate is that it's so
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.560]   easy to be led astray.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.040]   And oftentimes the people who are led astray are being led astray with leverage,
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.560]   meaning the magnitude of your mistake is amplified.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.920]   I got lucky in that when I started, I didn't know what I was doing and happened
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.520]   to make good decisions, but it was a roll of the dice and easily could have gone
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.160]   the other way.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.880]   I guess that's why I'm such an advocate for people taking the time, and I don't
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.360]   want people to get stuck in analysis paralysis, but I do feel that it's prudent
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.320]   to take the time to do your due diligence before you jump in because I didn't do
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:12.680]   that.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.280]   And it is only by the grace of God that I happened to get lucky.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:21.720]   And the fact that I did not do my proper due diligence before getting started
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.160]   happened to work out for me, not through any skill of my own, but through sheer
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:26.560]   luck.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.720]   I'm very glad that you were lucky for your sake and for the sake that you can
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.920]   now share all this with us.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.480]   I know a lot of people just kind of grew up with that belief that owning real
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.720]   estate is really important.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:44.520]   And in today's age, I know a lot of people also love the idea of flexibility
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.080]   and not necessarily being tied down.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.760]   So owning a rental property, I see people often coming at it because they say,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.360]   "Well, I'm not ready to buy a house where I live.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.440]   Maybe it's too expensive.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.840]   Maybe I want the flexibility.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.880]   But also, I want to own property, so I should get a rental property."
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.760]   And if that evolves to a true passion, I think that can be a really interesting
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.880]   opportunity for them.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:12.680]   But what do you think of some of these alternative ways to kind of own a piece
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.760]   of real estate, whether it's online platforms to buy parts of homes or even
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.800]   just investing in a REIT index fund as an alternative to buying rental property?
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.440]   How do you think of those as options?
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.520]   I think a REIT index fund is fine.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.680]   It's not going to be as low correlation.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.400]   So oftentimes when you're diversifying a portfolio, you want low correlation
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.880]   assets, meaning that as one asset class moves, you want to be in different asset
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.600]   classes that don't move in tandem with that one given asset class.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.160]   So if equities are moving in one direction, you want other asset classes
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.000]   within your overall portfolio that aren't necessarily moving hand in hand
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.160]   with the way the equities are.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.400]   When you own specific individual pieces of property, you have what is essentially
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.800]   a hybrid between a business and an investment.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.520]   You know, you have direct managerial authority over that piece of property.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.600]   You get to make the decisions around it and it has low correlation to other
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.720]   aspects, other elements of your portfolio.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.800]   If you have a REIT, there's greater correlation between that REIT and the
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.600]   overall equities, greater than if you were to own properties directly yourself.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.040]   That said, I'm a much bigger fan of REITs than I am these
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.040]   crowdsourced investing platforms.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.720]   The reason that I don't like crowdsourced investing is that it is fundamentally
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.840]   the actively managed mutual fund of real estate, right?
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.440]   If you're picking an actively managed mutual fund, and I don't recommend that
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.960]   people do that, but if you were to do that, then your job is to pick an excellent
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   fund manager and having the knowledge and the level of due diligence to be able to
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:00.240]   pick an amazing fund manager is itself a skill, right?
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.880]   There are people in the finance industry whose sole career is picking good
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.800]   managers, so what makes you think that you can do that better?
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.280]   And to be more specific or more clear about what I'm talking about, if you
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.120]   look at some of these crowdfunded real estate investing platforms, they might
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.960]   say, "Hey, look, check this out.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.720]   Here's a 250 unit apartment complex in Gainesville, Florida.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:31.520]   And here is a commercial shopping center in Raleigh, North Carolina, right?
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:43.280]   How do you, as an individual investor, know anything about the location of that
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.640]   apartment complex in Gainesville or that commercial shopping center in Raleigh?
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.120]   Like, how do you understand the location?
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.680]   How do you understand whether or not it's a good idea?
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.640]   How well do you understand the people who are managing that project?
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.480]   How good of a job do they do at managing said project?
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.680]   You know, there's a ton of due diligence that you yourself would need to do in
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.040]   order to know that that is a viable investment, and yet so many people believe
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.720]   that a crowdsourced platform absolves them of due diligence.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.600]   It's like a get out of due diligence free card.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.560]   So I know a lot of times when people think about getting into this, and
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:24.120]   whether it's passive income like real estate or starting a company, the most
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.280]   often heard complaint or kind of objection is that people don't have enough time.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.240]   And I've thought about this a lot because I kind of have
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.600]   struggled with valuing my own time.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.960]   And I know it's something that you have spent time thinking about and
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.440]   trying to kind of get over as well.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:47.320]   So how do you think people can start to value their time more so that they can
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.480]   spend it on the things that they care about, the things that are going to drive
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.360]   that long-term kind of impact on their life?
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.280]   So the best advice that I heard about this came from a writer named Laura
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.360]   Vanderkam, who I know has been a guest on both of our podcasts.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.440]   And Laura's advice was to first fill your schedule with all of the
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.600]   things that cannot be outsourced.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.000]   And only after you've done that, can you then start to fill your schedule
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.880]   with the things that could be outsourced.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.160]   So for example, exercise is something that you can't outsource.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.400]   As much as I would love to pay somebody to run on the treadmill for an hour on
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.560]   my behalf, I just can't.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.640]   Like, "Hey, can you weightlift on my behalf?"
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.360]   That would be great, by the way.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.720]   I would love to be able to do that.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.000]   Exactly.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.160]   But, you know, exercise can't be outsourced.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.720]   Sleep cannot be outsourced.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.200]   Calling your mom cannot be outsourced, right?
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.560]   So you first fill your schedule with all of those activities.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:51.440]   And only after you've filled your schedule with that, do you then take a
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.680]   look at everything else that you could potentially delegate and ask the
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.600]   question, "What of this should I delegate?
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.880]   What of this should I just straight up eliminate?
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.680]   And what of this should I actually do?"
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:11.320]   Is there a way you've found to get more comfortable with spending
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.480]   money on things that save you time?
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.720]   I know for me, I go back to all these examples like, "Wow, I'd rather drive
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.120]   an extra 30 minutes to get this thing that's $5 cheaper and that's a terrible
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.920]   use of my time," but I've just always struggled.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:33.080]   And no matter how much I divide my salary into hours, it still makes it very
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.000]   difficult to pay someone to do something that you could otherwise do yourself.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.200]   And it almost seems at odds with the idea of saving.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.560]   Right, right, exactly.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.000]   So I've struggled with this a lot because it used to be many years ago when I first
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.800]   started hiring and delegating, I kept telling myself, "If only I were more
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.600]   productive, if only I put in more hours, if only I was more productive during the
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   hours that I worked, right, couldn't I save this money?"
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:12.560]   There's so many people online who will say, "Yeah, but your hourly rate is X.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.960]   Like, let's say your hourly rate is, I don't know, $100 an hour.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.640]   And so if you can pay somebody $30 an hour to do this thing, your time is
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.720]   valued at $100 an hour, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:28.800]   Except that I'm aware of all of the hours that I am unloading the dishwasher.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.200]   I'm aware of all of the hours that I'm clipping my toenails, right?
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:38.400]   Like, I'm aware of all of the hours that I'm not actively making that money.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:45.760]   And so when you take that to its logical conclusion, right, then it feels as
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.240]   though, like, "Well, geez, if I just cut back on, like, the clipping my toenails
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.400]   hours, I could do it all."
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.640]   And so I've, I've learned not to try to take that line to its logical conclusion,
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.520]   because then you end up in these, like, in a logical extreme, a logically extreme
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.240]   situation.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.920]   I've learned instead to put boundaries around the number of hours that I am
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.680]   willing to theoretically work.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:20.560]   So I might say, "Hey, I'm willing to work a maximum of 45 or 50 hours a week.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.320]   What can I do within that container?"
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.960]   And everything has to fit inside of that container.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:32.600]   And if it doesn't fit in that container, then it, it has to be either delegated or
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.200]   eliminated.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.000]   One thing I've realized thinking through delegation, and this is a recent
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.920]   discovery, is there are things that you might think are wildly expensive to
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.440]   delegate that maybe aren't.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:52.000]   And so my wife and I were talking about what's something in our week that is
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   taking up a lot of time and preventing us from spending it on other things.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.400]   And we realized that now that we started eating with our daughter, who's only 12
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.360]   months old, we're spending a lot of time trying to get dinner ready for her meal
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.600]   time, which was 5.30.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:11.040]   And we were like, "Gosh, I'm sure it would be so expensive to hire a chef to come
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.520]   into our house and cook for us every night."
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   And the short answer is, "Yeah, it's really expensive to hire a chef to come
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.520]   in for a couple hours every night and cook for you."
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.680]   What it turns out it's not as expensive to do is hire someone who's not a
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.200]   professional chef, but who cooks just like I cook.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.240]   And they'll prepare your entire week of meals in advance and bring them over one
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.720]   day of the week, put them in your fridge, and then you just have to either reheat
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.840]   or throw something in the oven.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.800]   And the difference in that ends up being far less expensive than ordering out, much
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.440]   more control over health.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.520]   In fact, I think in advance, I make much healthier decisions.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.360]   So I'm actually eating healthier than I normally would be and not spending that
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:52.880]   time.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.840]   But at first glance, I thought it was impossible because it would cost, you
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.560]   know, thousands of dollars to have someone cook every meal.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:04.760]   And I love to cook, but it became a chore to have to cook by 5.30 every night, and
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.880]   it wasn't as enjoyable.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.360]   So I just challenge you, if you think there are things that you want to delegate
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.800]   and you don't think it's possible, for us, it was the difference between searching
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.880]   online for private chef and meal prep.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.360]   And it turns out that when you search for meal prep, you find something far less
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.800]   expensive than private chef.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.280]   So I think there are ways to delegate your time that you might not have expected.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.120]   Right, right, exactly.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:34.720]   So I'm curious, and this is a total non sequitur, but in the email that you sent
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.880]   me when we set up this interview, you mentioned that you flew to Egypt on a one
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.400]   way ticket.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:46.000]   I did the same, and you're the first person I know, other than my travel
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.320]   companions, to also fly to Egypt on a one way ticket.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.360]   Tell me about that.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.240]   So one of the most exciting things about talking to you is that I feel like there
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.760]   are these weird things that the more I researched your background, we're very
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.160]   similar.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:06.360]   So just to give everyone a full, long story, we've both spent time in our lives
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.960]   worried about being able to make money in the future.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.280]   We both went to a state school in Colorado.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.120]   We both traveled the world from 2009 to 2010, mostly staying in really, really
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.280]   inexpensive countries.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.640]   And as you mentioned, we both started with a one way ticket to Egypt.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.280]   Now, I think I'm going to disappoint you with this answer, but my wife and I
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.200]   decided we're going to take a trip around the world.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:28.920]   Where do we start?
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.560]   What do we do?
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   And we're like, wow, it is really cheap to go to Cairo.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.680]   Let's go to Cairo.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.280]   And so we bought this one way ticket to Cairo.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.320]   And about a week before, I was talking to someone and they said, "You know what
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:40.960]   would be really cool?
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:46.480]   I read this book about traveling overland from South Africa all the way through
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.520]   Africa up to Egypt."
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.320]   And I thought, "Wow, that's what I want to do."
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.480]   And then they asked, "Well, okay, what are you going to do after that?"
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.880]   And I said, "Well, I also want to go through the Middle East and we want to go
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.440]   to India."
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.840]   And they said, "Well, you're going the wrong way."
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:03.560]   So about a week before we took off on our one way ticket to Cairo, we were like,
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.400]   "We need to start at the other end."
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.720]   So we bought another ticket, but it turns out that the market for flying
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.840]   internationally within Africa is almost exclusively business travelers.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.320]   And so it is incredibly expensive.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:25.680]   So we found a cheap flight going from Cairo through Kenya down to South Africa
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.840]   and we bought that, but it left the next day.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.440]   So we started the trip in Cairo.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.800]   I visited a friend who I'd worked with who happened to live in Cairo for a day,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.840]   maybe it was two days.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.280]   We quickly went down to South Africa.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.760]   We actually started in Cape Town and we worked our way overland all the way back
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.640]   up to Cairo, with the exception that we tried so hard to get a visa to go to
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.840]   Sudan and couldn't.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:54.640]   And so we ended up having to buy a ticket from Uganda back up to Egypt.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.080]   Wow.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.720]   How long did that trip take and what were you driving?
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.800]   So we were actually taking mostly trains.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.760]   So we started in South Africa.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.240]   We went on a forum on the Internet and met two Swedish grad students who were
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:16.520]   about to start medical, like a medical externship at a hospital in South Africa.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:22.000]   And the four of us rented a car and made it all the way up to Zambia.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.960]   They came back and we took a 52 hour train ride through Tanzania, which if
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:33.400]   anyone ever has time on their hands in Africa, the Tazara train was like the
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:38.000]   coolest experience because it basically goes through the middle of Tanzania,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.640]   places you never would go on a car.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.720]   And the train stops randomly.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.640]   Sometimes it breaks down and you've got to wait for them to fix something.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:50.360]   But you get to see a side of Africa that it would take hours and hours to drive
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:56.240]   to and mostly trained around buses and everything and then finally had to fly.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.000]   The whole trip was about eight months.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.360]   And I think we did it on about $30 a day.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.000]   It's about a thousand bucks a month.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.400]   And it was, you know, one of those amazing things that you never get the
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.880]   opportunity to do until you force yourself to do it.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.560]   And I'm so glad we did back then.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.960]   That's awesome.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:22.240]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.520]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.120]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.200]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.640]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.920]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.720]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.960]   of going out for coffee.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.160]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.960]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.440]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.920]   it and over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.680]   this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.600]   Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.080]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.560]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.640]   visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.240]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.760]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:33.240]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.800]   leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.320]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.720]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.520]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.440]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.480]   with them for this episode.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.840]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.160]   scratch in the microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.080]   code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.120]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.800]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.600]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.320]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.880]   highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.280]   It is so good.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.760]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo collection they launched
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.840]   last year, you have to check it out.

[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   Well, so for context and for people listening.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.520]   So as you mentioned, this is something that we have in common.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   I also traveled.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:12.920]   I traveled for 27 months from 2008 to 2010, visited 17 countries over the span
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.280]   of 27 months, starting with a one-way ticket to Cairo, just as you did.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.280]   And what did you learn?
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.240]   What was your kind of macro takeaway from doing that?
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.200]   Ooh, geez.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.360]   You know, the idea of afford anything actually came to me when I was in
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.080]   Indonesia.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.120]   I don't think I've ever told anyone that before.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.080]   You heard it here first on this podcast.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.200]   But the actual phrase "afford anything" came in Bali.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:39.720]   I was thinking through what I wanted to do next because I had just, in 2008, I
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:44.480]   quit the newspaper and that was a really ballsy move.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.400]   Like who voluntarily quits a declining industry during a recession?
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.560]   Absolutely no one.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:54.440]   And so everyone told me that I was committing career suicide, that I would
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.560]   never get a job again.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.960]   And in hindsight, they were right.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.240]   I never did get a job again.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   And it was during that trip that I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:02.880]   to do next.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:08.000]   You know, I had a sense I was going to be a freelance writer, but I also knew that
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.040]   I wanted to build an asset.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.720]   There's a difference between writing for other people's publications versus
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.480]   starting your own publication or starting your own platform.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.440]   And so I had a sense that there was an asset.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.480]   There was a platform, a publication that I wanted to create.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.840]   And the name "afford anything" came to me during that trip.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.160]   That's amazing.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:34.400]   I think travel is something that kind of opens your eyes, changes your perspective
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:40.120]   in so many ways that if you're lacking creativity in your life, I think there's
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.840]   nothing more inspiring than visiting a place you've never been, meeting people
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.000]   you don't know that speak a different language and seeing where that takes you
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.080]   and changes your state of being and state of mind.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.360]   I think that so many people feel like they can't take a trip like that.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.280]   And to be clear, 27 months is a very long time.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.720]   Even my eight-month trip, everyone I know thought was an incredibly long time.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.840]   But people think that you can't do that.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.240]   You have to quit your job and go on career suicide.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:12.440]   And it's just not possible until you retire.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.960]   But I've heard you say something that I don't think anyone else has said.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.600]   Mini-retirements, semi-retirements.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.440]   What is that?
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:22.320]   And how could someone do this in their 30s, in their 40s or 50s?
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.000]   Yeah, yeah, it's funny.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.960]   There is this assumption.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.640]   It's a very binary, all-or-nothing thinking type of mentality
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.400]   where you're either working or you're not, right?
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.080]   You're either in your career or you are fully retired.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   I think that's an old and outdated model.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.040]   And so, let's first start by defining the difference
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.160]   between a mini-retirement versus a semi-retirement.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.760]   A mini-retirement is essentially a sabbatical.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.040]   You take a designated period of time off of work.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.400]   It could be three months, six months, eight months, as you did.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.800]   So, you take a limited period of time away from work.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.720]   And you either do that by taking a leave of absence from your employer
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.760]   or you do it when you are between jobs, between employment.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.120]   Or if you run your own business, you set up the systems,
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.560]   put the team in place, get everything running
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.440]   to such an extent that your business can operate
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.400]   independently of you for a temporary period of time.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.680]   So, that is what a mini-retirement is.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.960]   Semi-retirement is different.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:28.600]   Semi-retirement is where you go on maintenance mode.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.960]   So, you're technically still checking in,
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.920]   but you're not working full days.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.160]   You're doing just enough to keep your current projects alive,
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.600]   but not enough to have them grow.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.640]   I've spent a lot of time, especially in the last 10 years,
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:50.280]   oscillating between periods of intense growth
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.320]   where I'm parked at home and focused on growing my business.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.560]   And periods of what I call maintenance mode
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.040]   where I'm intentionally not growing
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.360]   and I'm in that semi-retired state.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.440]   And during that time, I'm off
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.280]   gallivanting in Slovenia or Croatia or, you know,
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.200]   I've been to Ecuador five times in the last couple of years.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.240]   You know, I'm off elsewhere doing something fun.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.720]   Not to say work isn't fun, but, you know, something different.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.920]   And so that's the distinction between a mini-retirement versus semi-retirement.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.480]   And depending on your situation, there will be phases of your life
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.280]   where one or the other is better or more applicable.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:33.240]   When I took that 27-month trip, I had just quit working at a newspaper.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.600]   And so given that I was between jobs, that was an ideal time
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   to just take that mini-retirement, take a 27-month break
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:45.240]   and say, I'm going to travel the world full time for over two years.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.720]   And I mostly lived off of savings that entire time.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:51.640]   I did a little bit of freelancing, but I worked fewer than five hours a week.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.320]   If that's not in the cards, and particularly if you run your own business,
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.760]   the semi-retire model is is a fantastic one.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.080]   You know, you might check in on Slack an hour a day.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.400]   You do just enough to make sure that you're not the bottleneck and no more.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.520]   And that allows everything to continue running stateside
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:16.400]   while you're often in Iceland or, you know, Argentina
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.560]   or wherever you choose to be.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.680]   Yeah, I think for people who've only ever taken a trip
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.200]   for a week or two weeks, it feels like, man,
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.920]   if you were working a few hours a day or even a few hours a week,
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.320]   it would really detract from the entire experience.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.600]   But if you've never taken a trip for a month or spent the whole two weeks
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.760]   in one place, what happens is there's actually more downtime.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.960]   And so I think whether you run your own business
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.640]   or even if you work for a company, if you could find a period of time
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.240]   where it would be OK for you to not put in everything,
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.640]   you know, if you work in sales, it's not at the end of the quarter,
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.280]   but it's a time where you could kind of go on work
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.560]   maintenance mode, as you said, and take a longer trip.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.480]   You can get the same number of things done and you can,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.920]   you know, see all the sites, meet all the people, eat all the foods,
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.640]   but still be able to get some work done and not necessarily have to take it all off.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.360]   And people often think they could never do that because it's so expensive.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.560]   But if you look at the cost to travel, the flights are often the biggest piece.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.040]   And so if you're going somewhere for twice as long, it doesn't cost twice as much.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.560]   And in many cases, renting an Airbnb for a month might be the same
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.360]   as renting a hotel for a week or a week and a half.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.480]   So with all the flexibility that COVID has given many people with remote work,
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.320]   I would encourage people who haven't ever taken a longer trip
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.000]   to maybe consider it and not feel like it's something
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.480]   you have to take an entire month off to do.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:52.680]   Right. Well, and the thing is, longer trips are so economically efficient
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.200]   because particularly if you're taking a trip that's long enough
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.680]   that you can either rent out your home
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.800]   or if you are a renter yourself, do it at the end of your lease.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.040]   Just don't renew your lease.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   Put all your stuff in storage and then go,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.160]   you know, be a full time traveler for a little while.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.720]   If you style it that way, then fundamentally,
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:19.480]   you're simply paying the cost of living in a different location.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:24.040]   You know, if you're just taking a vacation, you're paying for two different lives.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.680]   You're paying for your normal life.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.280]   And then you're also paying for your hotel in some other location.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.960]   Right. So you're essentially paying two rents during that time.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.040]   If you take a longer trip, you're only paying for one life.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.160]   And it's that one life that you have while you are riding
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.720]   the Trans-Siberian Railroad from Russia into Mongolia.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.760]   And and when you do that, then you compress your cost of living
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.840]   to only the costs incurred when you travel.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.160]   And oftentimes it's about the same or in some cases
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.440]   even cheaper than your cost of living in the US.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.160]   Yeah, when we left for eight months, we rented our apartment out
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.040]   and we rented it out furnished because we had all this furniture
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.160]   and we actually got more than our monthly rent.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.560]   And because we were in all these kind of much less expensive countries,
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.680]   I won't say it paid for the whole trip, but it certainly paid for a good
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.200]   part of the trip because we were actually making money at home.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.320]   So, yeah, if you aren't paying two rents, as you said, the trip can be a lot cheaper.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.760]   Exactly. So.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.200]   Sticking within the theme of the show, all the hacks,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.720]   you know, whether it's travel or life or anything you've learned,
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.400]   are there things that are your favorite tips, mindset shifts,
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.840]   tricks to either save money or just be happier
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.280]   in your life and traveling that you want to share?
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.640]   Mindset. Ooh.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.840]   I left it open because because it's it's all the hacks,
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   it's it's really take it anywhere you want.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.200]   It's that's a very broad question.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.840]   OK, mindset when it comes to happiness.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.600]   I think the single biggest shift for me has been understanding
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.080]   that basically nothing matters and everything will be fine.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.360]   Like when you get to the point where just nothing really phases you
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.880]   and you're not caught up in a lot of.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.920]   The small stuff that you used to think was important,
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.880]   I worried that that kind of cavalier attitude would make me less ambitious,
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.120]   make me less of a go getter at work.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.120]   I find it actually makes me more productive
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.560]   because I realize that there are only a few decisions that I make.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.080]   When I say a few, like a couple a year
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.040]   that are big with a capital B decisions
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.400]   and everything else is like details.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.040]   And I think mindset wise, once I really stopped
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.400]   worrying about the details and just, yeah, do what you can,
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.040]   but don't really sweat it, it.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.320]   Decreases my stress, increases my happiness.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.440]   And I don't think it, you know, negatively affects my performance.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.080]   It's either neutral or positive in terms of performance.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.400]   I like it.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.040]   One of my favorite savings hacks is being grateful.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.880]   So much of the time, people frame savings as deprivation.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.840]   Yeah. Oh, I couldn't have this amazing pair of shoes
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.120]   or I chose not to have this fantastic restaurant meal.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.480]   So I'm depriving myself. Right.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.880]   But if we reframe that thought.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.440]   And recognize how much we already have.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.080]   I mean, everyone listening to this podcast
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.560]   has the ability to listen to a podcast, right?
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:47.120]   We've got a smartphone and access to the Internet on a global scale.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.200]   Everyone listening to this podcast is among the globally
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.720]   richest people in the world.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.200]   And to go back to our conversation about traveling, travel
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.240]   certainly brings home just how wealthy,
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.840]   how relatively wealthy we are compared to the bottom billion.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.160]   When we deeply internalize that, it makes it very easy
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.840]   to not want a heck of a lot more because we already have so much.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:19.240]   And then that means that saving money or reducing
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.440]   spending is no longer an act of deprivation.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.600]   It's an act of acknowledging, hey, I'm good.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.080]   I don't need any more.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.600]   I've got more than enough already.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.760]   And are there habits to kind of embrace that grateful attitude that you like?
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.080]   I don't know if traveling would be considered a habit,
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.600]   but I certainly think that traveling, particularly to lesser developed areas,
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.120]   you know, I'm not just talking about traveling to Europe,
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.080]   traveling to to Bangladesh, traveling to Sri Lanka,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.600]   traveling to Nepal, which is where I was born.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.320]   I think that's really important to serve as a continual reminder.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:03.000]   I think I think having some involvement in philanthropy,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.880]   in charity work, in volunteering, I think that also is a grounding
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.520]   and is a reminder of the fact that we don't need to be
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.840]   endlessly searching for more.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.040]   People have talked about a gratitude practice.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.080]   I go in and out of that habit.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.560]   I won't claim that that's a habit that I have been able to consistently stick to.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.880]   But from what I have heard, there is research that backs
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.360]   that a gratitude practice, a daily practice of writing down
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.200]   one to three things that you're grateful for can be effective
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.440]   at retraining your brain to see such details and to bring those details
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.920]   to the forefront of your cognition.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.600]   Yeah, I think I'm in a similar boat where, you know, one Thanksgiving,
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.400]   someone started going around the table talking about what they were grateful for.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.320]   And it felt like such a great practice.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.920]   It was like, let's keep that up a little bit.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.600]   And and it fades away and comes back.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.920]   And I think it's helpful.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.120]   But I've also found it hard to make it a daily habit.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.960]   Was it you that has a hack for how to make it easier to build a new habit?
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.920]   Yeah, so there's a few.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.960]   One is habit stacking.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.320]   So take an existing habit that you currently have
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.040]   and stack it onto that habit.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.880]   So, for example, do it right after you brush your teeth in the morning.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.280]   Or for me, coffee is like a daily non-negotiable.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.680]   So if I'm trying to form a morning habit, linking it to my coffee habit,
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.840]   because I know I'm never going to forget to brew a cup of coffee.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.320]   So anything that's linked or chained to that
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.640]   has a much higher probability of sticking.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.400]   So that's one way that sort of one one hack around habit
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.520]   building, building habits that have some element of immediate gratification.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.800]   So there's a famous study in which the people who started who invented Febreze,
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.200]   they were trying to figure out why nobody would use that product.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.880]   And it was because Febreze eliminated odors,
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.560]   but there was no immediate gratification to spraying the bottle.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.920]   There was no immediate scent that people perceived.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.360]   And because people didn't perceive that immediate gratification,
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.600]   the habit didn't stick.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.960]   And so they artificially went back and added odors
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.480]   that are unnecessary for the efficacy of the product
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.520]   so that people would then get an immediate result
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.840]   from spraying the bottle, which helped in habit formation.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.120]   And so once I learned that, I started thinking through
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.240]   how I can incorporate some element of immediate gratification
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.600]   into any habit that I'm trying to build, particularly if it's a habit
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.520]   that has a good long term effect, but doesn't have an immediate
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.360]   short term effect.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.600]   So lighting a candle at a time
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.640]   when I do a monthly financial review, right?
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.880]   Lighting a candle or eating some chocolate at the time that I'm doing that.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:57.160]   Now I'm I'm tethering these things that have like immediate sensory benefit
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.640]   with reviewing the spreadsheet for the month.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.640]   And so I'm creating immediate gratification in that very act.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:11.360]   I used to ask my wife to help contribute towards our annual analysis.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.760]   And it was like, can we go into mint and recategorize
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.160]   all of our transactions to figure out where we spend money?
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.680]   And fortunately, we've stopped doing that both because it was too much time
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.040]   and it just wasn't wasn't as useful.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.600]   But I think if I had gone back in time and and maybe lit an ice candle
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.480]   and brought in a bar of chocolate, I feel like that wouldn't have had
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.680]   such a horrible memory in my wife's mind, thinking about having to go through
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.200]   and do that.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.600]   So I wish I could go back and do that.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.760]   But I will definitely use that tip in the future.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.520]   I have a friend who he and his wife have a weekly money meeting
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.880]   and they always do it over wine.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.560]   Nice. Yeah, I think anything over wine can make make things good
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.560]   unless you go overboard and have to wake up early.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.960]   Exactly.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.360]   Great. This was incredible.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.480]   I really appreciate you being here.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.520]   Any last things you want to share with with anyone listening?
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.280]   I guess the final thing that I would share with anyone listening
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.960]   is given the wide range of topics that we've covered.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.200]   What one thing resonated with you
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.160]   and how do you translate that into something actionable?
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.280]   You know, whether it's in the arena of saving money,
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.640]   earning more, starting a side hustle, negotiating for a new position at work
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.720]   or negotiating for a raise,
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.160]   planning a mini retirement.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.560]   Like we've talked about such a wide array of things.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.760]   What one thing stood out to you and what one action will you take
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.160]   as a result of having listened to this?
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.840]   That's the question that I would leave to the listener.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.680]   Yeah. And if you if you have that, please share it with me.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.880]   Email, Twitter or share it with Paula.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.000]   Paula, where can people find you online and share things with you?
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.480]   So I would encourage everyone listening to open your favorite podcast player,
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   which you're already using to listen to this show

[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.920]   So that's my podcast.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.440]   It's what I spend a lot of my time honing.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.080]   And the Afford Anything podcast is the number one way
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.000]   that you can hear more about my ideas.

[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.440]   Managing your money to living a better life.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.560]   So Afford Anything podcast is where you find me.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.280]   I've got a free ebook called Escape that you can download
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.680]   at affordanything.com/escape.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.440]   And that's all about escaping the nine to five,
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.080]   which we've talked about as a metaphor and living a better life.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.760]   Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.480]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.120]   That's a wrap for this week's episode of All the Hacks.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.240]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.720]   As I mentioned last week, we'll be doing a listener mailbag episode soon.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.160]   So if you have any questions you'd like me to tackle or hacks
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.600]   to share with our audience, please send them to Chris at allthehacks.com
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.520]   or I'm @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.440]   Also, if you tuned in to episode nine with Ramit,
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.360]   do you remember him challenging me to take a vacation with an unlimited budget?
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.800]   Well, it was too last minute for him to plan that vacation.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.840]   But I ended up trying to follow his advice on a trip to Greece
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.120]   where I am right now.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.520]   So how'd I do?
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.360]   Well, from the outside, pretty good.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.440]   We flew in business class and we're staying at some incredible five star resorts.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.480]   That said, I paid for coach flights and upgraded
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.800]   and we booked some of the hotels on points.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.600]   So from that regard, maybe I failed to not optimize.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.520]   However, my loss might be your gain.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.040]   So if you have any questions about how to use your points and miles
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.080]   for an incredible vacation, just send me an email or find me on Twitter
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.120]   and I'll do my best to help out.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.480]   Thanks again for listening.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.360]   I'll see you next week.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.600]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:51.440]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.520]   It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.840]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.400]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.400]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.520]   in this world can build wealth, and his passion and dedication
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.400]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.480]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.080]   stats that will blow your mind.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.120]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.720]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.320]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.240]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.160]   It's filled with tips and tricks on how to spend your money.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.040]   It's filled with tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.640]   with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.720]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.200]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.600]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
