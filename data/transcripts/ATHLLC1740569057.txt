[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.960]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.680]   your life, money and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.520]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey to
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.440]   find all the hacks.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   And today we're talking to Paula Pan, the founder and creator of Afford Anything,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   where she runs an award-winning personal finance website, a monthly newsletter
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.360]   with almost 100,000 subscribers, a top 50 podcast.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   She has an amazing story, starting her career as a journalist, making only
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.360]   $21,000 and building up her business and a portfolio of rental properties from
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.880]   scratch.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.480]   We'll talk about breaking free from a traditional nine to five job.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480]   We'll talk about learning to value your time, taking mini retirements throughout
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.760]   your life, setting up streams of passive income, and how life is just one big set
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.080]   of trade-offs that allow you to afford anything you want.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.880]   And at the end, I'll make sure to get some of Paula's favorite hacks.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.200]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.120]   Well, after I remind you that Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.240]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.120]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.280]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.240]   investment decisions.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.600]   Paula, thank you for being here.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.640]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.560]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.040]   So I have to start with Afford Anything.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.320]   So to some, I think it could sound like a get rich quick infomercial.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.600]   I know it's so much more than that.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.560]   Can you let people know what you mean when you say you can afford anything?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.480]   Sure.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.280]   The whole philosophy behind Afford Anything is that you can afford anything, but
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.480]   not everything.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.800]   So every choice that you make is a trade-off against something else.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.840]   And that doesn't just apply to your money.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.200]   That applies to any limited resource that you need to manage, like your time, your
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080]   focus, your energy, your attention.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.120]   Fundamentally, the concept of Afford Anything is the concept of opportunity
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.720]   costs.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.840]   It's so easy to fall into the trap of thinking that life is an endless series of
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.760]   "ands" when in fact life is a series of "ors."
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.840]   And are there specific things you think most people get wrong when they think about
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.080]   all of these trade-offs?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.000]   Oh, God, people do so much wrong.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.920]   Where do I even begin?
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.840]   In terms of spending the money that you currently have, we'll start there.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:55.520]   People often will, when they want to cut back on their spending, they chase the
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.680]   discretionary items which provide a psychological victory of easy wins, but
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.320]   don't actually move the needle.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.880]   So if you, for example, buy a cheap beer instead of a $14 martini, you can pat
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.280]   yourself on the back for the fact that you spent only three bucks on the beer
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640]   instead of $14 on the martini, right?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.360]   But what you're doing in that one instance, in that isolated incident, is
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.280]   you're giving yourself a veneer or a facade of having made a frugal decision
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.160]   without actually doing something substantive that would move the needle in
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.960]   the long run, right?
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.560]   If you were to put that same level of cognitive effort into, let's say, putting
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.640]   more effort into a search for your next apartment so that you are renting
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.120]   something that is $350 a month cheaper with a similar square footage, or if you
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.000]   were to put that same level of effort into being more aggressive about finding
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.680]   discounts on the types of insurances that you have, for example, right?
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.040]   The non-sexy stuff.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.600]   If you were to put that same level of effort into weatherproofing your home,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.680]   you know, weather stripping and caulk, like that sort of thing actually moves
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.040]   the needle, but it doesn't provide the psychological victory.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.120]   And so much of the time we're chasing the buzz, we're chasing the dopamine
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.960]   hit rather than the efficacy.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.120]   Yeah, I've heard you call this fake frugality at times, and it's something
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.800]   that I've definitely struggled with.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.080]   Is there a way that you would recommend people, myself included, get over it?
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.960]   Because sometimes it's not as easy as just saying, "Well, yeah, of course it
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.400]   makes more rational sense to spend time on these big decisions, but I feel like
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.000]   saving money and optimizing at every point is so ingrained in my being that
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   it's hard to not compare the prices of the beers at a restaurant and think, "Oh,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.360]   maybe I should get the $7 one instead of the $9 one and save a couple dollars,"
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.600]   even though it doesn't move the needle.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.960]   Exactly.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.320]   Exactly.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.280]   It's difficult to do.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.720]   I mean, fundamentally, you're asking a question about self-awareness, right?
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   And it's difficult.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.040]   And actually, really what you're asking is how to translate self-awareness into
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.600]   action, like how to bridge the awareness action gap, which is the question that
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.880]   has plagued mankind since the dawn of history.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.480]   So I don't expect us to have it solved by lunch.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:21.320]   But where I would start would be in terms of saving money to focus on the big three,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   housing, transportation, and food.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.480]   Those are the areas where you're likely to have the biggest wins.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.520]   And in fact, if we want to extend that to the big four, it would be housing,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   transportation, food, taxes, right?
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.760]   If you can just nail those four things, you can get a lot of stuff wrong as long
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.400]   as you get those four things right.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.600]   Beyond that, there's also, I think for most of the people who are listening to
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   this podcast, a very strong argument that perhaps saving money is not the side of
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.080]   the spectrum that they should be focused on.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.920]   One of the philosophies that I like to teach is a philosophy called "Grow the
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.240]   Gap." And what "Grow the Gap" means is that what we ultimately care about is the
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.160]   gap between what you earn and what you spend.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.320]   And there are only two ways to grow that gap.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.400]   You can either earn more, you can spend less, or you can do a combination of the
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.760]   two.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.600]   And I would venture to say that the majority of people who are listening to this
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.160]   podcast are probably educated enough, skilled enough, experienced enough that
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.680]   their bigger win could be found on the earning side of that equation.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   Yeah, I think I've heard a lot of people say there's a lot more upside to earning
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.800]   than downside to cutting costs, because most people can't spend an unlimited
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.720]   amount of money, though I've seen people try.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   You can't shrink your way to greatness.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.840]   I know.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.040]   And I think sometimes if you're really not spending mindfully, there might be a lot
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.280]   of opportunity to cut there.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.880]   But once you've done that, there's not that much more to go.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.640]   And there's a lot more creativity that you can apply towards earning more.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.200]   And I know you talk a lot about financial freedom.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.320]   How do you think that applies to this equation of earning more, having to work
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.200]   to make money and cut costs?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.080]   So as I see it, financial freedom gives you the ability to no longer have to do
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.320]   something purely for the paycheck and gives you the ability to choose the type
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   of work that you do so that you can do the work that is most aligned with your
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.720]   skills, your talents and what the world needs.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.680]   For all of us, there was a time in our lives where we had to do stuff for a
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.160]   paycheck.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.920]   I mean, I was 15 when I got my first job at the drive-thru of McDonald's, right?
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   Like the vast majority of us, unless you come from a very wealthy family, there's
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.120]   a time in your life, even if it's high school, college, maybe your early 20s,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.080]   where there's just stuff that you have to do.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.840]   You got to do what you got to do, right?
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.440]   Like you do what you need to in order to pay the bills.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.080]   You do what you need to in order to survive.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:59.200]   Financial independence, as I see it, is building enough of a safety net such that
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.640]   your basic survival is taken care of.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.760]   That doesn't necessarily mean that you are quote unquote retired, as you call it,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.440]   the cessation of work, right?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.520]   Which is a beautiful way of describing it.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.880]   It is not the cessation of income producing activity.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.520]   It is simply building enough of a safety net that if everything goes to hell, you
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.200]   know that you can survive, you know that you can be OK.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.040]   When you have that confidence, when you have that safety net built underneath
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.680]   you, then you no longer have to worry about keeping the lights on and you're
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.240]   free to take bigger risks.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:39.440]   I know you talk a lot about breaking free from this kind of nine to five life where
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.800]   you're working for 40 years straight, getting a couple of weeks of vacation.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.120]   Do you think that you can obtain this kind of freedom that lets you live life on your
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.360]   own terms while you're still working a job for someone else?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.160]   Or do you have to work for yourself to do this?
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.680]   Oh, no, you don't have to work for yourself.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.800]   You mean in order to reach financial independence?
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.880]   Yeah. And have that freedom.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.760]   You don't have to work for yourself in order to do it.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.440]   I think oftentimes when when even when I talk about escaping the nine to five, the
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.480]   nine to five is a metaphor, right?
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   The nine to five or when I talk about escaping the cubicle or, you know, those
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.480]   are metaphors for sucky jobs that you're in, not because you want to be in them,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.960]   but because you feel like you have to in order to pay the bills.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:33.880]   I have no objection to working your dream job at a company or a nonprofit or some
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:41.000]   sort of enterprise that genuinely thrills you and makes optimum use of your talent
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.520]   and time and skills, you know, something where you know that you are building a
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:52.280]   legacy and you know that you are leaving an asset behind like that type of work.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   The ownership is less important than whether or not you are achieving autonomy,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.080]   mastery and purpose through the work that you do.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   And what research shows is that if you have that sense of autonomy, mastery and
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.200]   purpose in your work, then you are highly likely to enjoy that form of work.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.560]   And so when I talk about escaping the nine to five, I'm using nine to five as a
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.840]   metaphor for those jobs that don't give you proper autonomy.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.600]   Perhaps they micromanage you.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.800]   They don't give you mastery.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.440]   Perhaps they're a poor fit for your skill set and they don't give you a sense of
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.040]   purpose.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.720]   You know, you're not in alignment with the type of legacy that you want to be
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.520]   leaving behind.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.760]   Yeah, I think I'm fortunate that after many years of discovery and searching, I
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.720]   found something where I actually really enjoy working for someone else and
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.160]   fulfilling autonomy, mastery and purpose.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.320]   And I but I know it seems to be and this is unfortunate, but the norm when I talk
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.240]   to people is that they haven't found a job that they all love in that way.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.800]   And that working for yourself is something so many people seem to aspire to.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.120]   So what advice would you give to someone who's at a job that kind of falls into
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.360]   that metaphor of a nine to five, something they're not loving and fulfilled by?
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:16.000]   If the goal is to grow a sufficient safety net such that they then have more
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.920]   options, more flexibility, the first thing that I would ask that person is, what is
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.280]   the most effective way for you to grow that gap, grow the gap between what you
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   earn and what you spend?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.280]   Now, for some people, particularly if you're already a high income earner and
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.480]   you live in a large home, you drive a newer car.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.920]   If there's obvious low hanging fruit that you can cut from your lifestyle, then cut
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.400]   the low hanging fruit first because it does give you that initial win.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.280]   And that initial win does provide that psychological motivation to continue on
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.800]   the path.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.800]   So particularly for high income earners, I would start with downsizing to a less
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:04.280]   expensive home, downsizing to vehicles or transportation that is functional rather
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.240]   than luxurious.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.440]   I would start there.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:13.080]   Once that's done, I would not endlessly iterate that because that I think is where
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   a lot of people go wrong, where they get so caught up in over-optimizing that they,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.040]   you know, when you hit the point where you're like unscrewing the oven light to
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.560]   save like, you know, two cents worth of electricity, you've gone, you've gone too
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:27.920]   far.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.800]   Before that, you've gone too far.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.360]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.120]   And I use that example because that's literally an example that I read on a
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.960]   website once.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.680]   The same person who also recommended tearing dryer sheets in half in order to
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.320]   make a box go twice as far.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.480]   You know, like when you're bisecting your dryer sheet, you know, you've crossed
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.000]   the line.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.040]   So don't become obsessive about extreme frugality.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.200]   Pick the low-hanging fruit and then shift your focus and find a way that you can
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.720]   earn more.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.360]   Now, depending on the career that you're currently in, this could come in three
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.280]   different forms.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:09.440]   Either you look for a promotion in your current line of work, whether that means
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.320]   getting promoted in your own company or creating a bidding war amongst many
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.440]   employers so that, you know, making a lateral move or even a vertical move into
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.080]   another company, right?
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.960]   So it could be a promotion within your own line of work.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.040]   That's option number one.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:30.240]   It could be retraining into a career change and retraining into a different
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.880]   line of work, ideally without going to grad school or without going back to grad
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.280]   school.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.080]   And the reason that I say ideally without grad school, it's not because of grad
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.520]   school itself.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.320]   It's because of student debt avoidance, right?
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.600]   So retraining with a new skill set in a way that does not incur student debt,
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.040]   that would be option number two.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.360]   Or starting some type of entrepreneurial enterprise, some sort of side hustle,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.600]   that would be option number three.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.080]   So depending on your current line of work, one of those three options would be
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.200]   ideal for you.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.760]   And which one is right for you depends on what you're doing.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:10.000]   If you're an anesthesiologist, obviously picking up a few extra shifts at the
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.600]   hospital is going to be a much better use of your time than selling candles on
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.880]   Etsy, right?
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.280]   So this one size fits all that a lot of personal finance gurus out there espouse
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.600]   where they're like, everybody should start a side hustle is far too much of a
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.560]   blanket statement.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.840]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.560]   I get it.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.480]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.160]   good hang.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.200]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.560]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.640]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.680]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.520]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.920]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.440]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.120]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.480]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.040]   yours.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.960]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.160]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.520]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.120]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.200]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.120]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.480]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.760]   So we had a Nick Loper on the show from Side Hustle Nation, and we talked a lot
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.800]   about some of the side hustles you can do to earn some extra income, but I don't
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.960]   think we spent as much time on how to transition side hustles into working for
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.240]   yourself and how to actually start a business.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.080]   And I know that's something you've done.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.280]   That's something you've talked about.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.640]   You've interviewed lots of people.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.000]   When someone kind of has that idea in their mind of, "I think I want to work for
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.080]   myself at some point," do you have a plan that you would share with them or a path
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.040]   or a process that someone should go through to try to make that happen?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.600]   So first of all, when we talk about the world of side hustles, I want to
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.080]   distinguish between two forms of side hustles.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.280]   First, you've got what I refer to as gig economy side hustles, things like driving
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.720]   for Uber, driving for DoorDash, walking dogs.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.600]   This is the low-hanging fruit of side hustles because you can start earning
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.400]   money immediately, but you're fundamentally not really growing your own
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.520]   business, right?
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.000]   You are fundamentally a dog walker on Rover or a driver for Uber.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.880]   Great if you need a quick hit of cash, but it's not something that's, I think,
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.320]   scalable for the long term.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.280]   So I want to distinguish between that gig economy form of side hustle versus
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.160]   starting your own business.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.200]   And when you start your own business, you can either sell a service or sell a
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.800]   product.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.440]   A lot of people start as service providers because there's a low cost of capital in
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.080]   doing so.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.640]   And, you know, so for example, perhaps you have a skill that you can sell as a
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.040]   freelancer, right?
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:21.480]   Whether that skill is writing, web design, coding, logo design, whatever that skill
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.000]   may be, perhaps there's a skill that you can sell as a freelancer or as a
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.080]   consultant that is a low cost of capital way to start.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:37.920]   And a lot of people begin there and that will allow you to become self-employed.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.680]   But there's a distinction between being self-employed versus being an
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.440]   entrepreneur.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:51.240]   And if you do your job well and you are successful at selling the service that
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.400]   you are offering, there will eventually come a point where you have to make the
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.040]   decision, do I want to become an agency, meaning do I want to be in an agency
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.720]   that sells this service or do I want to transition into product development and
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.280]   sales?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.560]   And by the time that happens, you will be far enough into self-employment.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.280]   You will be far enough into selling the service that you offer that I think
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.080]   you'll have a clear idea of which of the two paths you want to go in.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.880]   I'll give you an example from my own life.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.000]   So I used to be a newspaper reporter.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.160]   I made $21,000 a year and those are 2005 dollars, right?
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.520]   That's not like in 1942, I made 21,000.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.120]   So I graduated from college 2005.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.640]   I first shopped out of school.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.880]   I made $21,000 a year as an entry level newspaper reporter.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.760]   I worked at that newspaper for three years and at the time that I quit, my
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.720]   ending salary was $31,000 per year.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.800]   So that is what my honors diploma got me.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.360]   And 2008, I was like the last person to get the memo that print newspapers are
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.560]   not the way of the future.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:03.840]   I was going to conferences and everyone at newspaper conferences back in 2008,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.040]   like people were showing photos of Craig Newmark, I think the guy who invented
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.640]   Craigslist.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.680]   People would show his photos on slide decks and they'd be like, this guy killed
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.560]   newspapers.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.320]   You know, this guy destroyed classified ad revenue.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.640]   And so it was clear that the whole industry was collapsing.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.160]   A lot of major newspapers were shutting down.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.240]   McClatchy was on a hiring freeze.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.200]   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer had gone to online only, I believe.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.800]   Rocky Mountain News shut down.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.640]   So it was clear to me that the future was going to be freelance and online.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.480]   And so my thinking in 2008 was, I've got to transition into being an independent
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:39.920]   journalist.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.680]   I need to be freelance.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.600]   I need to be online.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.480]   I wasn't thinking about starting a business.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.120]   I wasn't yet aware that there was a distinction between self-employment and
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.880]   entrepreneurship.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.760]   And so my thought process at the time was simply, can I create a job for myself?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.840]   And so I began my career as a freelance personal finance writer, freelance
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.240]   personal finance journalist.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.360]   I specialized in that niche, knowing that like specializing in a niche would be the
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.800]   key to getting freelance gigs.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.000]   And I did that for a number of years.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.280]   And I eventually just hit the point where the work that I was getting wasn't just
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.760]   coming from news organizations.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.720]   A lot of it was coming from fintech companies.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:24.520]   Because fintech companies needed content on their websites and they didn't
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.840]   necessarily have enough staffing to have an in-house content creator.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.760]   And so they would have some harried overworked marketing person who would
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.400]   contract with me to write articles.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.680]   So I began doing that.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.240]   And then I realized that this harried overworked marketing person didn't really
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.160]   have the bandwidth to even manage me.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   And so then I just scaled up and was like, tell you what, I will provide
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.000]   turnkey content management services.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.880]   And I became an agency and I started hiring writers under me and became content
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.760]   management for hire for certified financial planners, for accountants, for
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.000]   small fintech companies.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.480]   This was maybe 2012, 2013.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.920]   And that was the transition from self-employment to entrepreneurship.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.840]   And it happened very organically.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.080]   There was never a plan.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.600]   It was never a goal.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.160]   I just sort of kept seeing where the needs were and what the pain points were in the
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.840]   market and then continually responded to those.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.920]   And then in parallel, I was also building out afford anything and I was growing
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.120]   this audience at afford anything.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.160]   And this audience kept asking me questions about investing, specifically real estate
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.920]   investing, because I was doing that with the money that I was making.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:38.320]   And so there were enough questions coming from the afford anything audience that it
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.640]   was clear that there was demand for an online course.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.480]   And I hit the point where I was like, I can't do both.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.920]   I can't be a service agency and also develop a product.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.800]   I'm going to have to do one of the two.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.920]   And neither of these are built out enough that I could sell either company.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.800]   So one of them, I'm just going to have to pull the plug on.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.720]   And that was terrifying.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.440]   To grow a six figure business and then just pull the plug on it was like
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.160]   absolutely terrifying.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.920]   But I pulled the plug on the service agency, cut all of that and went entirely
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.520]   into product development and built this course for afford anything.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.600]   And I assume the course, when you first made that decision, wasn't already
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.400]   generating six figures that it could easily replace the service business.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.960]   Is that fair?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.920]   Correct. Correct.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.600]   Yeah, it was not.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:34.200]   So I feel like that decision might be very similar to the decision of many people who
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.520]   are working at a six figure job and thinking about a business they could run,
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.000]   thinking about starting something on their own and are terrified with the idea of
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.400]   basically losing their income and starting something and taking a risk.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.280]   And so is there anything you learned from going through that, that you would tell
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.040]   someone facing that same kind of terrifying decision of of giving up the
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.960]   known for the higher upside, more enjoyment unknown?
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.640]   So I was absolutely terrified and I probably delayed making that transition by
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.320]   a year longer than I should have.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.800]   What gave me a lot of peace was knowing that if I could do it once, I could do it
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.400]   again. So I wanted to take this this moonshot.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.960]   I wanted to see if I could grow for it, anything to become as big as it could be.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.400]   And I knew that if it flopped, if it didn't work out, I had already grown a six
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.800]   figure service business once.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.200]   There's nothing stopping me from being able to do it again.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.440]   I was talking to a friend who worked at Google and they were considering whether
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.640]   they left to start a business on the side.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.320]   And I gave them kind of a similar piece of advice, which was.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.760]   Do you think that if this didn't work and you went back, you could get hired again?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.800]   And their answer was like, of course, like everyone is trying to hire talented
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.760]   people. My performance reviews have been great.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.320]   I'm sure that any year if I left this job and things didn't work out and I reached
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.360]   out to my manager and said, hey, could I come back?
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.880]   They would absolutely say yes.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:04.160]   And what it did was it changed the perspective of it's not giving up my career
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.600]   to go try something.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.600]   It's taking a year off and knowing that the downside isn't a career, it's however
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.960]   many months of income I would lose by taking this risk.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.720]   And so they'd saved enough money that they could do that.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.280]   And they said, OK, I'm going to take a year off.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.560]   And if it doesn't work, I might know after three months, I might know after six
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.800]   months. So it's a relatively low risk.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.600]   And some companies, if you're transparent, might even just let you take a
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.680]   sabbatical. You might not even have to leave to go explore this if you work in a
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.080]   field where your services are so in demand that companies would kind of do all
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.800]   kinds of things to try to make sure that they accommodate you.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.760]   So you can do this even if you've never started a business before, you've got
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   hired before. So it could be that that is your opportunity cost as well.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.440]   Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.560]   And what I love about the opportunity cost, as you just described, when you have a
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.600]   runway. Then fundamentally, the only thing that you're risking is that you are
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.240]   living more frugally than you otherwise would be.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.640]   And when that's the worst case scenario, that's not that bad.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.120]   No, especially if you're doing something you're passionate about.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:23.400]   It is so hard if you're working a job you hate to maybe give up a few of the joys
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.840]   you have in life. But if you're giving up the job you hate to go do something
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.080]   you're incredibly passionate about and every day you're excited to be doing what
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.160]   you're doing, it's way easier to maybe give up the vacation that year or a nicer
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.880]   car because you have this thing you're so passionate about to focus on.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.600]   And so I think it's easier to be frugal in your life when you're doing it because
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.360]   you get to do something that fulfills you more.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.560]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.760]   So one of the things you mentioned was that you had started investing in real
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:02.600]   estate. And earlier we talked about how you could get a promotion, you could find
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.920]   a new career, you could start a business or generate your own income.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:11.040]   We didn't talk much about the idea of passive income, but I know you sometimes
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:16.000]   talk about the long game, about ways that you can start to apply your time, skills
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.920]   and money towards generating kind of really sustaining long term financial
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:26.120]   returns. What do you think about passive income versus active income and should
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.160]   everyone be focused on it to some extent?
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.640]   So the first thing that I would say about passive income is I want to emphasize
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.280]   that passive income is not a euphemism for free money.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:47.480]   Passive income, or its synonym residual income, is frontloading the workload and
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.680]   it refers to the type of income that you make from any project in which you do a
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:00.200]   ton of work upfront so that you can enjoy that residual stream later.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.400]   That could be writing a piece of software or a book or a piece of music that
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.480]   provides royalties.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:12.320]   That could be building out a YouTube channel or a website or a podcast where
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.920]   you're still monetizing the back catalog, making money off of episodes that you
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.840]   created or articles that you created years ago.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.000]   Right. It could be buying rental properties where you frontload that
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.400]   workload of searching for the property, renovating it, getting it ready for
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.240]   those first tenants, finding a great property manager, building out the
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.760]   systems and putting that in place.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.640]   That is another example of passive or residual income.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.600]   But I do think it's important to emphasize that it is it is in no way a
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.760]   euphemism for free money and building out streams of passive income requires a
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.160]   significant amount of work.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.960]   That said, what I love about passive income is that it separates time from
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.880]   money. So much of the time we frame money in the context of time.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:07.440]   So we might say I charge X per hour or he or she makes Y per year.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.640]   And so this link between time and money is it was very held together in our
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.120]   minds. And what I think is beautiful about passive income is that it
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:23.200]   destroys that link and allows money to flow in independent of our input of
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.640]   time.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.240]   Yeah, and I think if you're able to set those streams of income up, then it
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.880]   makes it easier to have the flexibility to maybe pursue a new business down the
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.240]   road. Obviously, if the business is the passive income, then then that's a
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   little different. But one of the forms of passive income I know you're
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.480]   passionate about or at least you've spent a lot of time on is rental
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.240]   properties. And I think one of the interesting characteristics of it is
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.680]   that unlike maybe writing a piece of software or creating a piece of music,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.240]   it's a bit more accessible in that if you don't know an instrument or you
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.720]   aren't able to write software, those other ones are pretty difficult. Not
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.480]   that you can't learn and train up, but I think they feel less approachable.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.880]   But buying rental properties is something that I think many people see
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.640]   as much more approachable. Do you think that it could be something as a first
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.680]   step in passive income for almost anyone or do you recommend it for certain
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.440]   types of people?
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.760]   I would say that the first thing is that you have to actually want to do it.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.400]   Right now, rental properties have enough buzz that there are people who are
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.120]   FOMOing into it, doing it because everyone else on the internet is. And if
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.720]   that's your motivation, then that's the wrong reason to do it. And in any
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.520]   endeavor that you pursue, whether it's your career, your investments, your
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.440]   relationships, like there will be tough times. And if you don't actually want
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.080]   it in the first place, you're not going to be able to hang on through the tough
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.200]   times. So don't invest in rental properties unless your desire to do so
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.320]   is genuine. That's the first thing I'd say to anyone. That being said, I do
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.480]   believe that if the desire is genuine, any middle class person in the United
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.960]   States would be able to do it. You don't need to be handy. You don't need to
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.240]   live in a low cost of living area. I'm a firm believer in investing out of
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.800]   state for people who live in high cost areas. In fact, I prefer out of state
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.240]   investing over local investing for a variety of reasons. The big one being
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.080]   that it forces you to treat it like a business, forces you to develop systems,
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.160]   it forces you to build a team. You can't just swing by and replace the
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.240]   batteries and the smoke alarm. And so the forcing function of living far away
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.560]   from your properties, I think, absolves you from the need to be handy, forces
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.760]   you to treat it like a business, and gives a lot of geographic arbitrage
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.480]   power to people who are high income earners living in high cost cities.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.000]   I know you have a course that talks a lot about getting into this, and we'll
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.640]   definitely link to that course in the show notes for people who are
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.280]   interested. But at a high level, is there anything you would recommend
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.400]   someone do to start to say, "Am I passionate about this? Can I make this
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.360]   work? Do I have enough money saved?" Are there a few criteria you'd check off
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.160]   that would make someone a good fit for buying a rental property?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.600]   Well, if you have credit card debt, pay off the credit card debt first. Don't
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.200]   do anything until you've done that first. Now, that doesn't apply to
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.920]   student loans. It doesn't apply to, of course, if you have a primary
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.040]   residence mortgage. If you've got that lower interest single digit interest
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.080]   rate debt, I'm less concerned about that. But certainly pay off your credit
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.640]   cards. Make sure that you have an adequate emergency fund. Take care of
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.880]   those financial basics first. And if you are offered a 401(k) match or a
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.600]   403(b) match at work, make sure that you're contributing enough to your
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.000]   retirement accounts that you're at least getting that match. So those are
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.960]   the first steps. That's what I refer to as financial basics. After those
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.640]   financial basics are taken care of, then the world is your oyster in terms
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.240]   of what types of investments you want to go into. And if your interest is
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.640]   going into rental properties, then it is time to dive in and learn about
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.520]   it. I think the mistake that a lot of people make is they go in unknowingly.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.600]   They make assumptions like they assume that as long as the rent covers the
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.760]   mortgage, they'll be okay. That's one of the worst beginner assumptions that
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:21.920]   you can make. And so a lot of people, because they... I call this the error of
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.160]   the apparent similar, where because they have experience doing something at
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.880]   the amateur level, they believe that they can do it at the professional
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.680]   level. You know, just because you can hit a ball around a tennis court does
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.840]   not mean that you have the skill set of a Wimbledon player. Just because you
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.960]   can make dinner for yourself at home, it does not mean that you have the skill
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.480]   set of Gordon Ramsay, right? And so just because you've been able to purchase a
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.920]   personal residence for yourself does not mean you know how to look for
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.720]   properties, how to analyze properties, how to think about renovating
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.400]   properties. It doesn't mean that you know how to think like an investor. And
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.000]   the mistake that a lot of people make is that because they've done this at a
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   personal level, they believe that they know how to do it at a professional
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.320]   level. And that's the reason why I think it's so important to learn how to
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:21.400]   properly analyze, find, finance, and make renovation decisions. I don't mean
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.040]   pick up the hammer yourself. I mean, create a scope of work. How to do that
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.160]   from the lens of an investor.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:32.040]   And when you got started, you didn't know any of this. How did you learn all
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.240]   of it?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.600]   It was a combination of trial and error, reading as many books as I could get my
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:41.680]   hands on and going to investor meetup after investor meetup after investor
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.320]   meetup, you know, like repeated exposure to the point where I could eventually
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.160]   separate the wheat from the chaff, like the signal from the noise. The
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.080]   unfortunate reality in the world of real estate is that there are a lot of
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.520]   what I call like the scambergurus, you know, Lambergurus driving
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:03.880]   scambroginis. You know, you have a lot of ego in real estate. You have a lot
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:09.160]   of people who are flashy and they are promoting high risk, high leverage
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.440]   strategies. And frankly, I think a lot of what they're saying is dangerous.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.280]   And they say it because they have a vested interest in selling their idea to
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.800]   you. When you think about the world of real estate, most of the people that you
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.480]   deal with, real estate agents, lenders, these people don't get paid until you
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.800]   make a purchase. And so their incentive structure is to get you to buy. And
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.520]   oftentimes they will not give you the full picture. They they're not
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.560]   fiduciaries in your corner. And so I think what's unfortunate about the world
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:48.040]   of real estate is that it's so easy to be led astray. And oftentimes the
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.800]   people who are led astray are being led astray with leverage, meaning the
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.160]   magnitude of your mistake is amplified. I got lucky in that when I started, I
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.200]   didn't know what I was doing and happened to make good decisions. But it
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.920]   was a roll of the dice and easily could have gone the other way. I guess that's
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.000]   why I'm such an advocate for people taking the time. And I don't want people
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.520]   to get stuck in analysis paralysis, but I do feel that it's prudent to take the
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.880]   time to do your due diligence before you jump in, because I didn't do that. And
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.760]   it is only by the grace of God that I happened to get lucky. And the fact that
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.520]   I did not do my proper due diligence before getting started happened to work
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.360]   out for me, not through any skill of my own, but through sheer luck.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.480]   I'm very glad that you were lucky for your sake and for the sake that you can
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.920]   now share all this with us. I know a lot of people just kind of grew up with that
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.680]   belief that owning real estate is really important. And in today's age, I know a
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.120]   lot of people also love the idea of flexibility and not necessarily being
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:58.200]   tied down. So owning a rental property, I see people often coming at it because
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.600]   they say, "Well, I'm not ready to buy a house where I live. Maybe it's too
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.480]   expensive. Maybe I want the flexibility. But also, I want to own property, so I
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.960]   should get a rental property." And if that evolves to a true passion, I think
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.920]   that can be a really interesting opportunity for them. But what do you
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.520]   think of some of these alternative ways to own a piece of real estate, whether
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.760]   it's online platforms to buy parts of homes, or even just investing in a REIT
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.280]   index fund as an alternative to buying rental property? How do you think of
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.240]   those as options?
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.560]   I think a REIT index fund is fine. It's not going to be as low correlation. So
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.120]   oftentimes, when you're diversifying a portfolio, you want low correlation
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.560]   assets, meaning that as one asset class moves, you want to be in different asset
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.600]   classes that don't move in tandem with that one given asset class. So if
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   equities are moving in one direction, you want other asset classes within your
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.920]   overall portfolio that aren't necessarily moving hand-in-hand with the
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.720]   way that equities are. When you own specific individual pieces of property,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.000]   you have what is essentially a hybrid between a business and an investment. You
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.240]   know, you have direct managerial authority over that piece of property,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.320]   you get to make the decisions around it. And it has low correlation to other
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.720]   aspects, other elements of your portfolio. If you have a REIT, there's
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.200]   greater correlation between that REIT and the overall equities, greater than
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.880]   if you were to own properties directly yourself. That said, I'm a much bigger
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.240]   fan of REITs than I am these crowdsourced investing platforms. The
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:41.520]   reason that I don't like crowdsourced investing is that it is fundamentally
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.560]   the actively managed mutual fund of real estate, right? If you're picking an
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.160]   actively managed mutual fund, and I don't recommend that people do that, but
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:57.560]   if you were to do that, then your job is to pick an excellent fund manager. And
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:03.840]   having this, the knowledge and the level of due diligence to be able to pick an
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:09.480]   amazing fund manager is itself a skill, right? There are people in the finance
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:16.120]   industry, whose sole career is picking good managers. So what makes you think
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.720]   that you can do that better? And to be more specific or more clear about what
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.120]   I'm talking about, if you look at some of these crowdfunded real estate
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.800]   investing platforms, they might say, "Hey, look, check this out. Here's a 250
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.840]   unit apartment complex in Gainesville, Florida. And here is a commercial
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:43.600]   shopping center in Raleigh, North Carolina, right? How do you as an
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:51.920]   individual investor know anything about the location of that apartment complex
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.800]   in Gainesville or that commercial shopping center in Raleigh? How do you
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.960]   understand the location? How do you understand whether or not it's a good
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.440]   idea? How well do you understand the people who are managing that project?
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:09.840]   How good of a job do they do at managing said project? There's a ton of due
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.520]   diligence that you yourself would need to do in order to know that that is a
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.720]   viable investment. And yet so many people believe that a crowdsourced
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.760]   platform absolves them of due diligence. It's like a get out of due diligence
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.440]   free card.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.320]   So I know a lot of times when people think about getting into this, and
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:31.880]   whether it's passive income like real estate or starting a company, the most
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.520]   often heard complaint or kind of objection is that people don't have
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.000]   enough time. And I've thought about this a lot because I kind of have
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.880]   struggled with valuing my own time. And I know it's something that you have
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:51.200]   spent time thinking about and trying to kind of get over as well. So how do you
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.360]   think people can start to value their time more so that they can spend it on
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.440]   the things that they care about, the things that are going to drive that
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.160]   long term kind of impact on their life?
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.000]   So the best advice that I heard about this came from a writer named Laura
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.960]   Vanderkam, who I know has been a guest on both of our podcasts. And Laura's
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.480]   advice was to first fill your schedule with all of the things that cannot be
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.400]   outsourced. And only after you've done that, can you then start to fill your
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.600]   schedule with the things that could be outsourced. So for example, exercise is
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.720]   something that you can't outsource. As much as I would love to pay somebody to
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:37.120]   run on the treadmill for an hour on my behalf, I just can't. Like, "Hey, can
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.440]   you weightlift on my behalf?"
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.520]   That would be great, by the way. I would love to be able to do that.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.680]   Exactly. But you know, exercise can't be outsourced. Sleep cannot be
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.920]   outsourced. Calling your mom cannot be outsourced. Right? So you first fill
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.840]   your schedule with all of those activities. And only after you filled
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.640]   your schedule with that, do you then take a look at everything else that you
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.680]   could potentially delegate and ask the question, "What of this should I
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.520]   delegate? What of this should I just straight up eliminate? And what of this
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.440]   should I actually do?"
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:19.960]   Is there a way you found to get more comfortable with spending money on
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:26.040]   things that save you time? I know for me, I go back to all these examples like,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.600]   "Wow, I'd rather drive an extra 30 minutes to get this thing that's $5
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.960]   cheaper." And that's a terrible use of my time. But I've just always
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.680]   struggled. And no matter how much I divide my salary into hours, it still
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.000]   makes it very difficult to pay someone to do something that you could otherwise
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.960]   do yourself. And it almost seems at odds with the idea of saving.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:56.880]   Right, right. Exactly. So I've struggled with this a lot because it used to
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:04.360]   be many years ago when I first started hiring and delegating, I kept telling
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:10.160]   myself, "If only I were more productive. If only I put in more hours. If only I
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.800]   was more productive during the hours that I worked, right? Couldn't I save
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.840]   this money?" There's so many people online who will say, "Yeah, but your
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.240]   hourly rate is X." Let's say your hourly rate is, I don't know, $100 an
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.280]   hour. And so if you can pay somebody $30 an hour to do this thing, your time
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.320]   is valued at $100 an hour, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Except that I'm aware
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.400]   of all of the hours that I am unloading the dishwasher. I'm aware of all of the
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.280]   hours that I'm clipping my toenails, right? I'm aware of all of the hours
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:49.560]   that I'm not actively making that money. And so when you take that to its
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:55.120]   logical conclusion, right, then it feels as though like, "Well, geez, if I just
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:01.960]   cut back on the clipping my toenails hours, I could do it all." And so I've
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:07.040]   learned not to try to take that line to its logical conclusion because then you
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:16.440]   end up in a logically extreme situation. I've learned instead to put boundaries
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:22.080]   around the number of hours that I am willing to theoretically work. So I
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:29.200]   might say, "Hey, I'm willing to work a maximum of 45 or 50 hours a week. What
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.160]   can I do within that container?" And everything has to fit inside of that
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   container. And if it doesn't fit in that container, then it has to be either
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.040]   delegated or eliminated.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.800]   Yeah. One thing I've realized thinking through delegation, and this is a recent
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.720]   discovery, is there are things that you might think are wildly expensive to
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   delegate that maybe aren't. And so my wife and I were talking about what's
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.600]   something in our week that is taking up a lot of time and preventing us from
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.320]   spending it on other things. And we realized that now that we started eating
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.880]   with our daughter, who's only 12 months old, we're spending a lot of time
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   trying to get dinner ready for her meal time, which was 530. And we were like,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.640]   "Gosh, I'm sure it would be so expensive to hire a chef to come into our house
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.040]   and cook for us every night." And the short answer is, "Yeah, it's really
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.080]   expensive to hire a chef to come in for a couple hours every night and cook for
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.160]   you." What it turns out it's not as expensive to do is hire someone who's
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.440]   not a professional chef, but who cooks just like I cook, and they'll prepare
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.400]   your entire week of meals in advance and bring them over one day of the week, put
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.080]   them in your fridge, and then you just have to either reheat or throw something
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.360]   in the oven. And the difference in that ends up being far less expensive than
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.400]   ordering out, much more control over health. In fact, I think in advance, I
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.800]   make much healthier decisions. So I'm actually eating healthier than I normally
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.040]   would be and not spending that time. But at first glance, I thought it was
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.720]   impossible because it would cost thousands of dollars to have someone cook
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.840]   every meal. And I love to cook, but it became a chore to have to cook by 530
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.280]   every night, and it wasn't as enjoyable. So I just challenge you if you think
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.800]   there are things that you want to delegate and you don't think it's
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.520]   possible. For us, it was the difference between searching online for "private
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.800]   chef" and "meal prep." And it turns out that when you search for "meal prep,"
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.760]   you find something far less expensive than "private chef." So I think there
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.120]   are ways to delegate your time that you might not have expected.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   Right, right, exactly. So I'm curious, and this is a total non sequitur, but
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.360]   in the email that you sent me when we set up this interview, you mentioned
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:51.800]   that you flew to Egypt on a one-way ticket. I did the same. And you're the
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.400]   first person I know, other than my travel companions, to also fly to Egypt
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.240]   on a one-way ticket. Tell me about that.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   Yeah, so one of the most exciting things about talking to you is that I feel
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.160]   like there are these weird things that the more I researched your background,
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.080]   we're very similar. So just to give everyone a full, long story, we've both
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.800]   spent time in our lives worried about being able to make money in the future.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.360]   We both went to a state school in Colorado. We both traveled the world
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.000]   from 2009 to 2010, mostly staying in really, really inexpensive countries.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.880]   And as you mentioned, we both started with a one-way ticket to Egypt. Now, I
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.440]   think I'm going to disappoint you with this answer. But my wife and I decided
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.320]   we're going to take a trip around the world. Where do we start? What do we do?
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.120]   And we're like, "Wow, it is really cheap to go to Cairo. Let's go to
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.160]   Cairo." And so we bought this one-way ticket to Cairo. And about a week
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.240]   before, I was talking to someone and they said, "You know what would be
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.480]   really cool? I read this book about traveling overland from South Africa all
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.560]   the way through Africa up to Egypt." And I thought, "Wow, that's what I want
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.160]   to do." And then they asked, "Well, okay, what are you going to do after
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.440]   that?" And I said, "Well, I also want to go through the Middle East and we
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.680]   want to go to India." And they said, "Well, you're going the wrong way." So
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:11.360]   about a week before we took off on our one-way ticket to Cairo, we were like,
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.640]   "We need to start at the other end." So we bought another ticket. But it turns
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.040]   out that the market for flying internationally within Africa is almost
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.720]   exclusively business travelers. And so it is incredibly expensive. So we found
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:34.120]   a cheap flight going from Cairo through Kenya, down to South Africa, and we
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.320]   bought that. But it left the next day. So we started the trip in Cairo. I
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.560]   visited a friend who I'd worked with who happened to live in Cairo for a day,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.680]   maybe it was two days. We quickly went down to South Africa. We actually
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.760]   started in Cape Town, and we worked our way overland all the way back up to
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:57.160]   Cairo, with the exception that we tried so hard to get a visa to go to Sudan and
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.040]   couldn't. And so we ended up having to buy a ticket from Uganda back up to
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:02.480]   Egypt.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.560]   Wow. How long did that trip take? And what were you driving?
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:14.360]   So we were actually taking mostly trains. We started in South Africa. We
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.960]   went on a forum on the internet and met two Swedish grad students who were
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:25.200]   about to start medical externship at a hospital in South Africa. And the four
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:31.440]   of us rented a car and made it all the way up to Zambia. They came back and we
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:37.440]   took a 52 hour train ride through Tanzania, which if anyone ever has time
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.400]   on their hands in Africa, the Tazara train was like the coolest experience
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.920]   because it basically goes through the middle of Tanzania, places you never
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.880]   would go on a car. And the train stops randomly. Sometimes it breaks down and
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.400]   you've got to wait for them to fix something. But you get to see a side of
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.680]   Africa that it would take hours and hours to drive to. And mostly trained
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.720]   around buses and everything and then finally had to fly. The whole trip was
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.720]   about eight months. And I think we did it on about $30 a day. It's about a
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.920]   thousand bucks a month. And it was one of those amazing things that you never
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.520]   get the opportunity to do until you force yourself to do it. And I'm so glad
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   we did back then.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.760]   That's awesome.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.240]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:47.360]   Well, so for context and for people listening, so as you mentioned, this is
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   something that we have in common. I also traveled. I traveled for 27 months from
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.760]   2008 to 2010, visited 17 countries over the span of 27 months, starting with a
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.360]   one-way ticket to Cairo, just as you did.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.320]   And what did you learn? What was your kind of macro takeaway from doing that?
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.360]   Oh, geez. You know, the idea of "afford anything" actually came to me when I was
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.760]   in Indonesia. I don't think I've ever told anyone that before. You heard it
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.840]   here first on this podcast. But the actual phrase "afford anything" came in
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.080]   Bali. I was thinking through what I wanted to do next because I had just, in
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:28.320]   2008, I quit the newspaper. And that was a really ballsy move. Like, who
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.640]   voluntarily quits a declining industry during a recession? Absolutely no one.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.520]   And so everyone told me that I was committing career suicide, that I would
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.880]   never get a job again. And in hindsight, they were right. I never did get a job
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   again. And it was during that trip that I spent a lot of time thinking about
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.680]   what I wanted to do next. You know, I had a sense I was going to be a
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   freelance writer. But I also knew that I wanted to build an asset. There's a
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.120]   difference between writing for other people's publications versus starting
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.600]   your own publication or starting your own platform. And so I had a sense that
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:05.520]   there was an asset, there was a platform, a publication that I wanted to create.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.840]   And the name "afford anything" came to me during that trip.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:16.160]   That's amazing. I think travel is something that kind of opens your eyes,
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:21.280]   changes your perspective in so many ways that if you're lacking creativity in
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.520]   your life, I think there's nothing more inspiring than visiting a place you've
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.760]   never been, meeting people you don't know that speak a different language and
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.120]   seeing where that takes you and changes your state of being and state of mind.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.920]   I think that so many people feel like they can't take a trip like that. And to
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.880]   be clear, 27 months is a very long time. Even my eight-month trip, everyone I
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.640]   know thought was an incredibly long time. But people think that you can't do
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.280]   that. You have to quit your job and go on career suicide. And it's just not
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.760]   possible until you retire. But I've heard you say something that I don't
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.200]   think anyone else has said. Mini-retirements, semi-retirements. What is
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.760]   that? And how could someone do this in their 30s, in their 40s or 50s?
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.320]   Yeah. Yeah, it's funny. There is this assumption. It's a very binary,
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   all-or-nothing thinking type of mentality where you're either working or
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:20.000]   you're not, right? You're either in your career or you're fully retired. I
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.640]   think that's an old and outdated model. And so, let's first start by defining
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.400]   the difference between a mini-retirement versus a semi-retirement. A mini-
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:33.360]   retirement is essentially a sabbatical. You take a designated period of time
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.600]   off of work. It could be three months, six months, eight months as you did. So
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.720]   you take a limited period of time away from work and you either do that by
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.800]   taking a leave of absence from your employer or you do it when you are
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.440]   between jobs, between employment. Or if you run your own business, you set up
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.120]   the systems, put the team in place, get everything running to such an extent
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.560]   that your business can operate independently of you for a temporary
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.560]   period of time. So that is what a mini-retirement is. Semi-retirement is
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:12.240]   different. Semi-retirement is where you go on maintenance mode. So you're
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:19.360]   technically still checking in, but you're not working full days. You're
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.560]   doing just enough to keep your current projects alive, but not enough to have
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.720]   them grow. I've spent a lot of time, especially in the last 10 years,
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   oscillating between periods of intense growth where I'm parked at home and
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.520]   focused on growing my business and periods of what I call maintenance mode
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:45.760]   where I'm intentionally not growing and I'm in that semi-retired state. And
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:51.920]   during that time, I'm off gallivanting in Slovenia or Croatia or I've been to
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.480]   Ecuador five times in the last couple of years. I'm off elsewhere doing
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.560]   something fun. Not to say work isn't fun, but something different. And so
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.920]   that's the distinction between a mini-retirement versus semi-retirement.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.080]   And depending on your situation, there will be phases of your life where one
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:12.880]   or the other is better or more applicable. When I took that 27-month
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.680]   trip, I had just quit working at a newspaper. And so given that I was
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.200]   between jobs, that was an ideal time to just take that mini-retirement, take
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:27.600]   a 27-month break and say, "I'm going to travel the world full-time for over
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.120]   two years." And I mostly lived off of savings that entire time. I did a
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.880]   little bit of freelancing, but I worked fewer than five hours a week. If
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.800]   that's not in the cards, and particularly if you run your own business, the
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:44.640]   semi-retire model is a fantastic one. You might check in on Slack an hour a
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.120]   day. You do just enough to make sure that you're not the bottleneck and no
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.480]   more. And that allows everything to continue running stateside while
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   you're off in Iceland or Argentina or wherever you choose to be.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:07.040]   Yeah. I think for people who've only ever taken a trip for a week or two
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:13.200]   weeks, it feels like, man, if you were working a few hours a day or even a
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.040]   few hours a week, it would really detract from the entire experience. But
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.720]   if you've never taken a trip for a month or spent the whole two weeks in
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.360]   one place, what happens is there's actually more downtime. And so I think
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.840]   whether you run your own business, or even if you work for a company, if you
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.480]   could find a period of time where it would be okay for you to not put in
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.720]   everything. If you work in sales, it's not at the end of the quarter. But it's
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.520]   a time where you could go on work maintenance mode, as you said, and take
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:49.440]   a longer trip. You can get the same number of things done. And you can see
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.960]   all the sites, meet all the people, eat all the foods, but still be able to get
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.120]   some work done and not necessarily have to take it all off. And people often
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:00.960]   think they could never do that because it's so expensive. But if you look at
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.840]   the cost to travel, the flights are often the biggest piece. And so if you're
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.760]   going somewhere for twice as long, it doesn't cost twice as much. And in many
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:15.200]   cases, renting an Airbnb for a month might be the same as renting a hotel for
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.840]   a week or a week and a half. So with all the flexibility that COVID has given
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.400]   many people with remote work, I would encourage people who haven't ever taken
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.320]   a longer trip to maybe consider it and not feel like it's something you have to
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:34.080]   take an entire month off to do. Right. Well, and the thing is, longer trips are
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.320]   so economically efficient, because particularly if you're taking a trip
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:44.160]   that's long enough that you can either rent out your home, or if you are a
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.000]   renter yourself, do it at the end of your lease. Just don't renew your lease,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.480]   put all your stuff in storage and then go, you know, be a full time traveler for
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:59.120]   a little while. If you style it that way, then fundamentally, you're simply
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:03.520]   paying the cost of living in a different location. You know, if you're just
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.160]   taking a vacation, you're paying for two different lives. You're paying for
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:13.680]   your normal life. And then you're also paying for your hotel in some other
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:19.120]   location. Right. So you're essentially paying two rents during that time. If
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.920]   you take a longer trip, you're only paying for one life. And it's that one
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:29.840]   life that you have while you are riding the Trans-Siberian Railroad from Russia
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:36.080]   into Mongolia. And when you do that, then you compress your cost of living to
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:42.400]   only the costs incurred when you travel. And oftentimes it's about the same, or
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:46.240]   in some cases, even cheaper than your cost of living in the U.S.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.800]   Yeah. When we left for eight months, we rented our apartment out and we rented
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.280]   it out furnished because we had all this furniture and we actually got more than
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.840]   our monthly rent. And because we were in all these kind of much less expensive
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:04.480]   countries, I won't say it paid for the whole trip, but it certainly paid for a
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.240]   good part of the trip because we were actually making money at home. So yeah,
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.280]   if you aren't paying two rents, as you said, the trip can be a lot cheaper.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.420]   Exactly.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:20.240]   So sticking within the theme of the show, all the hacks, whether it's travel or
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.800]   life or anything you've learned, are there things that are your favorite tips,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:30.640]   mindset shifts, tricks to either save money or just be happier in your life and
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.240]   traveling that you want to share?
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.520]   Mindset. Ooh.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.520]   I left it open because it's all the hacks. It's really... Take it anywhere you
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.020]   want.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:47.600]   That's a very broad question. OK, mindset when it comes to happiness, I think the
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.320]   single biggest shift for me has been understanding that basically nothing
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.880]   matters and everything will be fine. Like when you get to the point where just
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.560]   nothing really phases you and you're not caught up in a lot of the small stuff
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.920]   that you used to think was important, I worried that that kind of cavalier
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.240]   attitude would make me less ambitious, make me less of a go-getter at work. I
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.920]   find it actually makes me more productive because I realize that there are only a
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:23.040]   few decisions that I make when I say a few, like a couple a year that are big
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.320]   with a capital B decisions and everything else is like details.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:35.040]   And I think mindset wise, once I really stopped worrying about the details and
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:41.280]   just, yeah, do what you can, but don't really sweat it, it decreases my stress,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.480]   increases my happiness. And I don't think it negatively affects my performance.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.000]   It's either neutral or positive in terms of performance.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.440]   I like it.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:58.960]   One of my favorite savings hacks is being grateful. So much of the time people
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.280]   frame savings as deprivation. Yeah. Oh, I couldn't have this amazing pair of
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.680]   shoes or I chose not to have this fantastic restaurant meal, so I'm
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:17.040]   depriving myself, right? But if we reframe that thought and recognize how
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.000]   much we already have, I mean, everyone listening to this podcast has the
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.760]   ability to listen to a podcast, right? We've got a smartphone and access to
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.360]   the internet on a global scale. Everyone listening to this podcast is among
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.480]   the globally richest people in the world. To go back to our conversation
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.400]   about traveling, travel certainly brings home just how wealthy, how
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.240]   relatively wealthy we are compared to the bottom billion. When we deeply
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.280]   internalize that, it makes it very easy to not want a heck of a lot more
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.760]   because we already have so much. And then that means that saving money or
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.520]   reducing spending is no longer an act of deprivation. It's an act of
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.760]   acknowledging, "Hey, I'm good. I don't need any more. I've got more than
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.760]   enough already." And are there habits to kind of embrace that grateful
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.560]   attitude that you like? I don't know if traveling would be considered a
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.280]   habit, but I certainly think that traveling, particularly to lesser
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.600]   developed areas, you know, I'm not just talking about traveling to Europe,
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.800]   traveling to Bangladesh, traveling to Sri Lanka, traveling to Nepal, which
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.280]   is where I was born. I think that's really important to serve as a
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:46.240]   continual reminder. I think having some involvement in philanthropy, in
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.840]   charity work, in volunteering, I think that also is grounding and is a
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.960]   reminder of the fact that we don't need to be endlessly searching for more.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.480]   People have talked about a gratitude practice. I go in and out of that
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.400]   habit. I won't claim that that's a habit that I have been able to
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.360]   consistently stick to, but from what I have heard, there is research that
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.200]   backs that a gratitude practice, a daily practice of writing down one to
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.440]   three things that you're grateful for can be effective at retraining your
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.520]   brain to see such details and to bring those details to the forefront of
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.880]   your cognition. Yeah, I think I'm in a similar boat where, you know, one
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.320]   Thanksgiving, someone started going around the table talking about what
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.440]   they were grateful for, and it felt like such a great practice. It was
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.120]   like, "Let's keep that up a little bit," and it fades away and comes
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.280]   back. And I think it's helpful, but I've also found it hard to make it a
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   daily habit. Was it you that has a hack for how to make it easier to build
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.640]   a new habit? Yeah, so there's a few. One is habit stacking. So take an
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.360]   existing habit that you currently have and stack it onto that habit. So, for
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.800]   example, do it right after you brush your teeth in the morning. Or for me,
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.280]   coffee is like a daily non-negotiable. So if I'm trying to form a morning
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   habit, linking it to my coffee habit, because I know I'm never going to
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.120]   forget to brew a cup of coffee. So anything that's linked or chained to
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:20.720]   that has a much higher probability of sticking. So that's one way that, sort
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.920]   of one hack around habit building. Building habits that have some element
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.040]   of immediate gratification. So there's a famous study in which the people who
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.040]   started, who invented Febreze, they were trying to figure out why nobody
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.640]   would use that product. And it was because Febreze eliminated odors, but
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.080]   there was no immediate gratification to spraying the bottle. There was no
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.240]   immediate scent that people perceived. And because people didn't perceive that
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.560]   immediate gratification, the habit didn't stick. And so they artificially
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.000]   went back and added odors that are unnecessary for the efficacy of the
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.320]   product. So that people would then get an immediate result from spraying the
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:08.320]   bottle, which helped in habit formation. And so once I learned that, I started
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.120]   thinking through how I can incorporate some element of immediate gratification
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.720]   into any habit that I'm trying to build. Particularly if it's a habit that has a
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:24.640]   good long-term effect, but doesn't have an immediate short-term effect. So
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:31.120]   lighting a candle at a time when I do a monthly financial review, right?
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.640]   Lighting a candle or eating some chocolate at the time that I'm doing
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.680]   that. Now I'm tethering these things that have like immediate sensory
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:45.760]   benefit with reviewing the spreadsheet for the month. And so I'm creating
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.560]   immediate gratification in that very act.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:54.320]   I used to ask my wife to help contribute towards our annual analysis.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.120]   And it was like, "Can we go into Mint and recategorize all of our
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.480]   transactions to figure out where we spend money?" And fortunately, we've
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:05.600]   stopped doing that both because it was too much time and it just wasn't as
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   useful. But I think if I had gone back in time and maybe lit a nice candle
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.880]   and brought in a bar of chocolate, I feel like that wouldn't have had such a
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.800]   horrible memory in my wife's mind thinking about having to go through and
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.640]   do that. So I wish I could go back and do that, but I will definitely use
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.680]   that tip in the future.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:27.040]   I have a friend who he and his wife have a weekly money meeting and they
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.080]   always do it over wine.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.120]   Nice. Yeah, I think anything over wine can make things good unless you go
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.560]   overboard and have to wake up early.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.840]   Exactly.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:41.120]   Great. This was incredible. I really appreciate you being here. Any last
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.520]   things you want to share with anyone listening?
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:50.080]   I guess the final thing that I would share with anyone listening is given the
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.440]   wide range of topics that we've covered, what one thing resonated with you and
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.760]   how do you translate that into something actionable? Whether it's in the
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:05.200]   arena of saving money, earning more, starting a side hustle, negotiating for
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.320]   a new position at work or negotiating for a raise, planning a mini-retirement.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.720]   We've talked about such a wide array of things. What one thing stood out to
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.160]   you and what one action will you take as a result of having listened to this?
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.800]   That's the question that I would leave to the listener.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.400]   Yeah, and if you have that, please share it with me, email, Twitter, or share it
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.920]   with Paula. Paula, where can people find you online and share things with you?
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.640]   I would encourage everyone listening to open your favorite podcast player, which
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.280]   you're already using to listen to this show, and go follow the Afford Anything
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:48.960]   podcast. That's my podcast. It's what I spend a lot of my time honing. The
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.360]   Afford Anything podcast is the number one way that you can hear more about my
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.280]   ideas, everything ranging from managing your money to living a better life.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.760]   So, Afford Anything podcast is where you find me. I've got a free ebook called

[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.160]   about escaping the nine-to-five, which we've talked about as a metaphor, and
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.040]   living a better life.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.720]   Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.880]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.360]   That's a wrap for this week's episode of All The Hacks. Thank you so much for
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   listening. As I mentioned last week, we'll be doing a listener mailbag episode
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.520]   soon. So, if you have any questions you'd like me to tackle or hacks to share
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.280]   with our audience, please send them to chris@allthehacks.com or I'm @hutchins
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.240]   on Twitter. Also, if you tuned in to episode nine with Ramit, do you remember
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.400]   him challenging me to take a vacation with an unlimited budget? Well, it was
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.320]   too last minute for him to plan that vacation, but I ended up trying to follow
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.800]   his advice on a trip to Greece, where I am right now. So, how'd I do? Well, from
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.880]   the outside, pretty good. We flew in business class and we're staying at some
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.720]   incredible five-star resorts. That said, I paid for coach flights and upgraded,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.800]   and we booked some of the hotels on points. So, from that regard, maybe I
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.880]   failed to not optimize. However, my loss might be your gain. So, if you have any
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.720]   questions about how to use your points and miles for an incredible vacation,
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.120]   just send me an email or find me on Twitter, and I'll do my best to help out.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.600]   Thanks again for listening. I'll see you next week.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.660]   you
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:37.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
